      "abstract": "A psychiatric emergency is acute behavioral disturbance requiring urgent intervention, manifesting with mood, thought disorder or behavioral signs and symptoms. Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

      "abstract": "Les problèmes d’une consommation excessive chez les sujets âgés (+ de 65 ans) sont sous-estimés, sous-identifiés, sous-diagnostiqués et sous-traités. Une des raisons est probablement la confusion sur ce qui peut être attribué à l’âge ou aux effets de l’alcool. De plus, ces derniers imitent certains symptômes d’autres maladies et troubles, par exemple les troubles anxieux, la dépression ou la démence. La plupart des outils de dépistage sont insuffisamment adaptés aux personnes âgées et l’estimation de l’abus d’alcool chez celles-ci varie largement selon les méthodes utilisées. La vieillesse devient également un facteur de fragilisation face à la consommation d’alcool surtout si la personne âgée présente des problèmes de santé. Les alcoolisations sont souvent une réponse à la solitude, à l’isolement ou à la perte de soutien social et à l’anxiété, à la dépression et au stress. L’efficacité des interventions brèves dans le cas d’abus d’alcool chez les adultes âgés a été soulignée par ses résultats. L’approche clinique cognitive sur les addictions met l’accent sur l’importance des croyances concernant le produit d’alcoolisation. Certaines trouvent leur source dans l’âge de la personne.",

Physical examination and laboratory tests generally have limited added value. Main reasons for referral are a suspected treatable cause for cognitive decline (e.g. delirium), focal neurological deficit (e.g. stroke), suspected dementia under the age of 65-70 years, additional complex somatic or psychiatric disorders or further work-up in non-native speaking people.",

Course a. Chronic, usually early onset, poor long-term outcome,devastating illness 1) Prodromal phase: often prolonged period of socialwithdrawal, delayed developmental milestones, awkward in motor skills, loss of interest in self-care2) Active phase: psychotic symptoms appear, diagnosis is made more clear3) Residual phase: similar to prodomal phase b. Prognostic features and indicators1) Good outcome a) Acute onset, short duration, no previous psychi-atric history, no family history of schizophrenia b) Mood symptoms present, sensorium clouded c) No obsessive-compulsive disorder, noassaultiveness d) Premorbid functioning good, high socioeconomicclass e) Married, good psychosexual functioning f) Normal findings on neuroimaging2) Poor outcome a) Insidious onset, chronic duration, psychiatric his-tory present, positive family history of schizophreniab) Mood symptoms absent, sensorium clear c) Obsessive-compulsive disorder is present,assaultiveness is present d) Poor premorbid functioning, low socioeconomicclasse) Never married, poor psychosexual functioning f) Structural abnormalities present on neuroimaging5.

Neuroanatomical findings on imaginga. Most consistent finding is ventricular enlargement, especially third and lateral ventriclesb. Selective reduction in size of frontal lobe, basal ganglia, thalamus, and limbic regions, including the hippocampus and medial temporal lobec. Possible decrease in volume of neocortical and deep gray matterd. Sulcal widening, especially frontal and temporal areas e. Some studies indicate small but significant difference inbrain and intracranial volume f. Increased incidence of1) Cavum septum pellucidum 2) Partial callosal agenesis8. Functional neuroimaging a. Hypofrontality (frontal and prefrontal cortex): negativesymptoms and neurocognitive deficits b. Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies implicatefrontal cortex (orbital, dorsolateral, medial), anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, several temporal lobe subregions, and cerebellumc. PET studies: anatomic substrate for visual hallucinations in schizophrenia 1) Inferotemporal cortex is responsible for visual recogni-tion of objects and faces 2) Basal ganglia output (primarily substantia nigra parsreticulata) to inferotemporal cortex with relay in ventral anterior thalamic nucleus-influences visualprocessing and causes altered visual perception (hallucinations) as a result of increased dopaminergic activity in basal ganglia (may also be the mechanism of hallucinations in parkinsonian syndromes sensitive to dopaminergic agents [diffuse Lewy body disease more so than idiopathic Parkinson disease])9. Neuropathology a. Decreased cell density in the dorsomedial nucleus ofthalamus b. Displacement of interneurons in frontal lobe cortex c. Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11. Clinical management (see PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND OTHER TREATMENTS) a. Mainstay treatments: antipsychotics (D2 receptor block-ers [postsynaptic]) b.

Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12. Psychosocial intervention strategies a. Emphasis on outpatient treatment b. Partial hospitalization, day treatments, outpatient care c. Family therapy reduces relapse rate d. Self-help organizations e. Cognitive therapy techniques: the goal is to remediatethe abnormal thought processes f. Social skills training: little effect on risk of relapse g.

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "Success at school increases self-esteem. Any difficulty will have consequential effects on the psychological health of the subject. The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "title": "El trastorno por consumo de alcohol como producto del conflicto intrapsíquico",
      "abstract": "El trastorno por consumo de alcohol consiste en un patrón desadaptativo de consumo de la sustancia que conlleva un deterioro o malestar clínicamente significativo, un período continuado de 12 meses. Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "title": "Functional (Psychogenic) Cognitive Disorders: A Perspective from the Neurology Clinic",
      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

Drugs, especially those related to neurotransmitters may induce complicated symptoms in the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. Some of these symptoms are accompanied by peripheral neuropathy. Intoxication, especially alcoholism is often are combined with a malnutrition, such as avitaminosis. Dysautonomic symptoms change successively; at an early stage, drugs or toxins stimulate sympathetic or parasympathetic receptors, while the same receptors are inhibited at a later stage when the concentration of the substances rises in the blood. Frequent stimulations of the same receptor may produce change in the sensitivity of receptors, decreased metabolism or addiction. These changes suggest that a different approach towards the acute and chronic autonomic disorders caused by intoxications is needed.",

The most typical form of intermittent alcoholism is dispomania. During the acute episode of dipsomania, the patient presents an extreme craving for alcohol and a complete loss of control. The alcohol consumption usually leads to severe overdoses and coma. The cases of pure dipsomania are relatively rare in daily practice. Most often, intermittent forms of alcohol abuse or dependence are observed in patients who present, between the acute ingestions of alcohol, a chronic consumption. Intermittent ingestions of alcohol can also be present among subjects presenting a pathological personality (antisocial personality) and a past or present dependence syndrome to heroine. These patients use alcohol like a drug in order to get a modification of the conscience, a high, a sedation or a trip.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse. However, further studies should be carried out to clarify clinical characteristics of the nicotine paradox.",

      "abstract": "Abstinence syndrome is a chronic, progressive and fatal disease characterized by tolerance and physical dependence or pathological organic changes. The consumption excessive use of alcohol mainly affects the human being that can be physical and mental since some aspects of the social and cultural life are forming and socializing like a placental activity generating effects of euphoria, bad humor and relaxation. Alcoholism produces pathophysiological effects where alcohol is concentrated in the blood which is related to the central nervous system causing depressive disorders where the human can lead to a coma. One of the main consequences is the excessive use of alcohol that causes physical, mental and social damages as it affects the brain centers responsible for self-control, which means that we do not stop taking the effects of substance use. Symptoms of withdrawal include autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor in the hands, insomnia, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations. One of the factors that increase the level of alcohol consumption is sex, young age, aggression, anxiety, sweating, and depression. Through nursing interventions in a patient with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, it will be possible to identify, plan, organize and execute the actions that will be performed both for the patient and the family and to determine the most damaging effects and consequences in this type of pathology.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "title": "Alcohol Induced Cerebellar Ataxia: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consumption of alcohol excessively causes dependence and leads to psychological discomfort. Motivation to drink is influenced by a variety of neurobiological and environmental variables. The proclivity of an individual to imbibe is thought to reflect a balance between alcohol&rsquo;s positive reinforcing (i.e., rewarding) effects, such as euphoria and anxiety reduction (i.e., anxiolysis), and the drug&rsquo;s aversive effects, which are typically associated with negative consequences of alcohol consumption (e.g., hangover or withdrawal symptoms). Neuroadaptive alterations caused by continuous alcohol use and abuse (such as tolerance and physiological dependence) are regarded to be critical in the shift from regulated alcohol use to more frequent and excessive, uncontrollable drinking which induces cerebellar degeneration considered as common type of acquired toxic ataxia. Excessive use leads to degeneration of the midline cerebellum. Progressive trunk and gait ataxia is characteristic, with little involvement of upper limbs, eyes or speech (a corollary of relative cerebellar hemispheric sparing). Abrupt termination of alcohol use after a period of heavy drinking may result in alcohol withdrawal seizures. Generalized tonic&ndash;clonic seizures are the most common and severe form of seizure in this conditions. Current case report presents complaints of astasia and slurred speech with few episodes of seizures. The diagnosis indicated Mild cerebellar atrophy.

      "title": "Molecular and behavioral aspects of the actions of alcohol on the adult and developing brain",
      "abstract": "The brain is one of the major target organs of alcohol actions. Alcohol abuse can lead to alterations in brain structure and functions and, in some cases, to neurodegeneration. Cognitive deficits and alcohol dependence are highly damaging consequences of alcohol abuse. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to alcohol, and that drinking during gestation can lead to a range of physical, learning and behavioral defects (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders), with the most dramatic presentation corresponding to fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent findings also indicate that adolescence is a stage of brain maturation and that heavy drinking at this stage can have a negative impact on brain structure and functions causing important short- and long-term cognitive and behavioral consequences. The effects of alcohol on the brain are not uniform; some brain areas or cell populations are more vulnerable than others. The prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, the white matter and glial cells are particularly susceptible to the effects of ethanol.The molecular actions of alcohol on the brain are complex and involve numerous mechanisms and signaling pathways. Some of the mechanisms involved are common for the adult brain and for the developing brain, while others depend on the developmental stage. During brain ontogeny, alcohol causes irreversible alterations to the brain structure. It also impairs several molecular, neurochemical and cellular events taking place during normal brain development, including alterations in both gene expression regulation and the molecules involved in cell–cell interactions, interference with the mitogenic and growth factor response, enhancement of free radical formation and derangements of glial cell functions. However, in both adult and adolescent brains, alcohol damages specific brain areas through mechanisms involving excitotoxicity, free radical formation and neuroinflammatory damage resulting from activation of the innate immune system mediated by TLR4 receptors.Alcohol also acts on specific membrane proteins, such as neurotransmitter receptors (e.g. NMDA, GABA-A), ion channels (e.g. L-type Ca2+ channels, GIRKs), and signaling pathways (e.g. PKA and PKC signaling). These effects might underlie the wide variety of behavioral effects induced by ethanol drinking. The neuroadaptive changes affecting neurotransmission systems which are more sensitive to the acute effects of alcohol occur after long-term alcohol consumption. Alcohol-induced maladaptations in the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, abnormal plastic changes in the reward-related brain areas and genetic and epigenetic factors may all contribute to alcohol reinforcement and alcohol addiction.This manuscript reviews the mechanisms by which ethanol impacts the adult and the developing brain, and causes both neural impairments and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. The identification and the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ethanol toxicity might contribute to the development of treatments and/or therapeutic agents that could reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of alcohol on the brain.",

Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident). On the other hand, person with single episode of an alcohol-related problem is not necessarily an alcoholic; in such case, the condition may be better termed alcohol abuse.",

The pathway to the diagnosis of alcoholism may be considerably compromised in the often comorbid or multimorbid patient. To live up to an advanced age seems to be a good argument against chronic substance abuse. Elderly people and their relatives are often still more reluctant to report about socially stigmatizing disorders. On top of that, the amount of social control is reduced after the end of employment and upon entering retirement. Yet, if alcohol-withdrawal symptoms occur, e.g., following an admission of the addicted patient to a hospital, the missed diagnosis of alcoholism means a delay of the correct interpretation of such complications and of the necessary treatment. Aged patients with reduced physical and mental reserve capacity are at special risk of developing further serious complications. Progressive, sometimes irreversible decay of the cognitive functions in long lasting delirious states or, as an aftermath of withdrawal, epileptic seizures are of particular importance.",

The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Sir: Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in motor behavior and changes in thought, mood, and vigilance 1 and occurs in a variety of medical and neuropsychiatric conditions. 2 Catatonia has been documented as occurring in alcohol withdrawal in rodents, 3 but not in humans.We report the case of a patient in whom alcohol withdrawal presented as catatonia.Case report.Mr. A, aged 35 years, presented in January 2006 with a history of alcohol use over the last 10 years.He fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence for the last 5 years.He presented with tremors, irritability, anorexia, and insomnia within 24 hours of abrupt cessation of alcohol intake.Seventy-two hours after cessation of alcohol intake, he developed signs of negativism, mutism, and psychomotor agitation lasting 2 days, followed by psychomotor retardation, stereotypies, and stupor over the next 2 days, fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for catatonia.There were no psychotic or mood symptoms, clouding of consciousness, disorientation, or any general medical condition that could explain these symptoms.He had experienced a similar episode 2 years previous, following 3 days of abstinence from alcohol, that remitted upon treatment with lorazepam.Family history was positive for alcohol dependence in first-and second-degree relatives but was negative for psychotic or mood disorders.The findings of laboratory investigations were within normal limits.As the patient's condition could not be described adequately by DSM-IV criteria for alcohol withdrawal or catatonia, the diagnosis of alcohol-induced psychotic disorder was made, with onset during alcohol withdrawal and presenting with catatonia.Mr. A was treated with lorazepam 16 mg per day and with vitamin supplements.His symptoms remitted completely within 72 hours.Catatonia has been documented in alcohol dependence in relation to drug interactions involving disulfiram 4 and in delirium. 1 The temporal correlation between alcohol abstinence and the appearance of catatonia in the absence of these other causes suggests that the catatonia in this case was due to alcohol withdrawal.Perturbations in γaminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic transmission have been implicated in the pathophysiology of both catatonia 2 and alcohol withdrawal. 5,6 Furthermore, the GABA A modulator lorazepam is effective in both conditions. 1,7 To our knowledge, this case is the first such case reported in the literature.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy.

Im Vortrag wird ein kurzer Überblick über die wichtigsten neuropsychiatrischen Folgeschäden bei Alkoholismus gegeben und einige aktuelle Befunde zu Pathophysiologie und Therapie mitgeteilt. Eines der thematisierten Krankheitsbilder betrifft dabei die Alkoholhalluzinose, eine eher seltene Störung, bei denen der Alkoholkranke an akustischen Halluzinationen, gelegentlich auch paranoiden Symptomen oder Bewusstseins- und Orientierungsstörungen leidet. Trotz phänomenologischer Ähnlichkeit besteht offensichtlich keine genetische Verbindung zur Schizophrenie. Kasuistische Beobachtungen aus der Bildgebung haben gezeigt, dass bei Patienten mit Alkoholhalluzinose häufig eine Hypofunktion des Thalamus vorliegt, ähnlich wie bei schizophrenen Erkrankungen.

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

The peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) after a single amount of alcohol is reached 30-45 minutes after ingestion, depending on the rate of absorption and whether food has been taken. Alcohol is a pharmacological intoxicant that suppresses the brain and the rest of the central nervous system. Alcohol interferes with the ability to form new memories, particularly when it is taken in intoxicating amounts. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of neurotransmission in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new memories. A common consequence of clinically significant alcohol intoxication is memory loss for events that occurred while the person was intoxicated—a form of anterograde amnesia.",

This thus covers a wider field than the word \"medicine\" or \"medicament\". There are many substances which are capable of provoking anxiety and are very frequently consumed. According to recent publications the use and abuse of alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, marihuana, and drugs such as sedatives (neuroleptics), caffeine, minor tranquilisers and other may provoke acute and chronic anxiety and depression. When confronted with anxiety states or depressive states, it is absolutely essential not to overlook the possibility that they may have been induced by a medicament or a drug which the patient has been using.",

Many features that are important in terms of driving adversely affected under the influence of alcohol and substance and therefore impaired driving behavior arises in drivers.The most effective way to fight for preventing this impaired driver behav- ior is the restrictions and regulations imposed on drivers in traffic related to alcohol and drug use. Nevertheless, in the literature, some drivers continue to impaired driving function with a risky traffic behavior, in which the driver personality (risk-taking, thrill-seeking, self-control), psychopathologi- cal (substance abuse, personality disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger and aggression), and many other neuropsychological features are considered to have a relationship with this situation.

      "abstract": "Pharmacological concerns need epidemiological elucidation\n\nPatients with depressive disorders could be more liable to accidents than others for several reasons. These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN Los 2C (popularmente conocidos como tusi o cocaína rosa) son un grupo de sustancias pertenecientes a las fenetilaminas con efecto psicoestimulante y alucinógeno. Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

Some patients experience seizures, which may increase in severity with subsequent AW episodes. Another potential AW complication is delirium tremens, characterized by hallucinations, mental confusion, and disorientation. Cognitive impairment and delirium may lead to a chronic memory disorder (i.e., Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome). Psychiatric problems associated with withdrawal include anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. In addition, alterations in physiology, mood, and behavior may persist after acute withdrawal has subsided, motivating relapse to heavy drinking. Recent advances in neurobiology may support the development of improved medications to decrease the risk of AW complications and support long-term sobriety.",

Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

      "abstract": "Alcohol shows a high affinity by nervous system, and that explains the behaviour-altering effects of drinking. Te nervous system affinity of alcohol is due to biochemical and metabolic characteristics of this substance: 1) Alcohol is rapidly and homogeneously distributed by body tissues and fluids, penetrating through body barriers, including the hematoencephalic one. 2) Because of its great liposolubility, it interacts with lipoid component in neuronal membrane causing long-term changes in neuronal conductance, and long-term structural changes. Behaviour disturbances in alcohol-abusing persons are related with: 1) Alcohol acute effects on neuronal membrane and synapses consisting in transitional disturbances on membrane potential and neurotransmission function. 2) Alcohol long-term effect causing by brain adjustment in synaptic transmission. 3) The relative irreversible disturbances induced by structural synaptic damage. 4) Other conditions related with alcohol abuse but not directly causing by it, such as nutritional deficiencies, and pathologic conditions seen in chronic alcoholism. In clinical practice we usually find disorders due to acute effects of ethanol on brain like different disorders related with alcohol intoxication; disorders due to tolerance development, such as withdrawal syndrome; and those chronic ad multicausal conditions with different degree of reversibility which are consequences of structural brain damage, like Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy, alcoholic neuropthaty, and alcohol induced dementia.",

Los ciclos circadianos se desajustan y alteran; se puede perder la noción del tiempo, presentarse insomnio o exceso del dormir, rechazo de los alimentos o alteración de los horarios de su ingesta. La co-ocurrencia de trastornos depresivos y por uso de alcohol se asocia con una mayor severidad y un peor pronóstico de los mismos, por lo que es importante que los servicios de salud implementen acciones de detección temprana, derivación y tratamiento oportuno para ambas condiciones.",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5. Vernachlässigung von Interessen zugunsten des Spielens, erhöhter Zeitaufwand, um zu spielen bzw. zu wetten, bzw. entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu beschaffen, oder sich von den Folgen zu erholen. 6. Anhaltendes Spielen bzw. Wetten trotz Nachweises eindeutiger schädlicher Folgen, wie z.B. finanzieller Schädigung durch exzessives Spielen.",

Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda .

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe principal routes of cocaine administration are oral, intranasal, intravenous, and inhalation.The slang terms for these routes are, respectively, \"chewing,\" \"snorting,\" \"mainlining,\" \"injecting,\" and \"smoking\" (including freebase and crack cocaine).Cocaine use ranges from occasional use to repeated or compulsive use, with a variety of patterns between these extremes.There is no safe way to use cocaine.Any route of administration can lead to absorption of toxic amounts of cocaine, allowing to acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular emergencies that could result in sudden death.Repeated cocaine use by any route of administration can produce addiction and other adverse health consequences.Those who snort or sniff cocaine through their noses suffer damage to their nasal and sinus passages.These include nasal crusting, nosebleeds, nasal congestion, irritation, facial pain caused by sinusitis and hoarseness.Cocaine addiction changes the responsiveness of the brain to various neurotransmitters or chemicals.The development of drug addiction involves persistent cellular and molecular changes in the Central Nervious System.The brain dopamine, GABA and glutamate systems play key roles in mediating drug-induced neuroadaptation.We show some physiological changes that can occur in some key pathways in which glutamate, dopamine and GABA receptors are involved.These chemical changes cause different effects in users, including: anxiety, confusion, dizziness, psychosis, headaches and nausea.Cocaine use and addiction affects the sympathetic nervous system (which controls automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat, etc.).This system secretes adrenaline which raises ones heart rate, narrows blood vessels and significantly increases blood pressure.Chest pain, heart attacks and strokes are common side effects of cocaine use.The most widely studied neurobiological characteristic of cocaine addiction is the role played by dopamine transmission.It is clear that enhanced dopamine transmission in neurons projecting from the ventral mesencephalon to the limbic forebrain, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), is the pharmacological target for cocaine-induced reinforcement and locomotor stimulation (O'Brien., 2001) However, persistence of the behavioral characteristics of cocaine addiction, such as paranoia (sensitization) and the propensity to relapse years after the acute rewarding effects of the drug have disappeared, indicates that there must also be neuronal substrates undergoing Addictions -From Pathophysiology to Treatment 104 long-term neuroplastic changes.Although studies have endeavored to identify enduring changes in dopamine transmission that might underlie behavioral sensitization and the reinstatement of drug-seeking (relapse), the results have not been entirely consistent with an obligatory role for dopamine.Addiction can be viewed as a form of drug-induced neural plasticity.One of the bestestablished molecular mechanisms of addiction is up-regulation of the cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse.This up-regulation and the resulting activation of the transcription factor CREB appear to mediate aspects of tolerance and dependence.In contrast, induction of another transcription factor, termed 1FosB, exerts the opposite effect and may contribute to sensitized responses to drug exposure.Knowledge of these mechanisms could lead to more effective treatments for addictive disorders.Cocaine Dopamine Tansporter (DAT) Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) Serotonine Transporter (SERT)",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (&amp;#x03C7;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

      "abstract": "Excessive intake of ethyl alcohol leads to acute intoxication and necessitates the same management as other forms of intoxication. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, medical history and course. Determination of alcohol level in the expired air is of limited interest. If low or absent, it should direct clinical investigation toward a disorder having similar symptoms; if high, it does not necessarily explain the clinical picture. The severity of the intoxication must always be assessed carefully. Severity is linked either to a complication of acute alcohol intoxication (coma, inhalation, pneumopathy), or to an associated disorder, observed in 50% of the patients (cranial trauma, drug intoxication). Means of treatment and patient management are simple and well established.",

      "title": "Treating Catatonia: a Blind Spot of Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

An individual may experience social consequences, such as interpersonal conflict related to use, and may be persuaded to enter a treatment program as a result. An individual may suffer an accident such as a car crash or near-drowning while under the influence (consequences related to use in dangerous situations). An individual may acknowledge the need for treatment after losing his/her job, home, car, friends, and family (job and personal role and social consequences). Alternatively, an individual may merely feel socially isolated, alienated, and fraught with physical reactions (e.g., shakes) that are unpleasant.

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

These effects include changes in emotions and personality as well as impaired perception, learning, and memory. Neuropathological and imaging techniques have provided evidence of physical brain abnormalities in alcoholics, such as atrophy of nerve cells and brain shrinkage. At the cellular level, alcohol appears to directly affect brain function in a variety of ways, primarily by interfering with the action of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and other neurotransmitters. Neurological disorders also can result from vitamin deficiency and liver disease, two health problems that commonly occur with alcoholism. Other hypotheses, based on factors such as aging, gender, and genetics, have been developed to explain various alcohol-related neurological consequences. Many pharmacological treatments to improve neuropsychological functioning in alcoholics have been tested, but none has proved entirely successful. With prolonged abstinence, however, slow recovery of cognitive functioning can occur in some cases.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

Other symptoms include delusions, thought disorder, psychomotor disturbances, and abnormal affect. To establish the diagnosis, one must rule out other disorders such as alcohol withdrawal delirium or other psychotic disorders. Although it is well recognised, relatively little is known about the condition. Moreover, the pathogenesis and treatment of AIPD are still unclear despite high co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders, high re-hospitalization as well as mortality rates and suicidal behaviour.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

Analysing such questions is indispensable during criminal actions where the responsibility and culpability of the offender is to be considered. The examination of the offender's mental state may help to recognise undiagnosed neuro-psychiatric conditions. The case of a man, suspected to have violently murdered his spouse is reported. During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness. The alcoholic state does not limit culpability, while epileptic disturbance of consciousness may exempt the offender.",

More recently, increasing attention has been directed toward the understanding of neurobiological and environmental factors in susceptibility to relapse.",

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

Signs and symptoms of AW can include, among others, mild to moderate tremors, irritability, anxiety, or agitation. The most severe manifestations of withdrawal include delirium tremens, hallucinations, and seizures. These manifestations result from alcohol-induced imbalances in the brain chemistry that cause excessive neuronal activity if the alcohol is withheld. Management of AW includes thorough assessment of the severity of the patient's symptoms and of any complicating conditions as well as treatment of the withdrawal symptoms with pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches.

Withdrawal symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of stopping smoking and include intense craving, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty in concentrating and increased appetite.

Recent cognitive theories suggest that optimal information processing related to the capacity to make decisions under uncertainty conditions is impaired either prior to the initiation of alcohol use, or it is related to the consequence of its repeated utilization. In this paper, we suggest that alcoholism may be the product of an imbalance between two separate, but interacting, cognitive registers that contribute to decision making: a reactive/automatic attentional and memory system for signaling the presence of alcohol cues in the environment and for attributing to such cues pleasure and/or excitement; and a reflective/nonautomatic system for regulating the dominant reactive/automatic response. Hyperactivity within the reactive system can override the reflective system and brain/cognitive changes induced by ethanol could lead to the disruption of self-regulation. We finally develop the idea that different patterns of imbalance between reactive and reflective systems could lead to distinct patterns of clinical impulsivity involved in the vulnerability to, the development of, and the relapse into alcoholism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes.

Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "Background: Alcohol use disorders, defined as the maintenance of alcohol use for at least a 12-month period despite negative psychological, biological, behavioral, and social consequences, are frequently associated with psychotic symptoms. Objective: Our aim in this paper is to review alcohol-related clinical conditions that are accompanied by psychotic symptoms, alcohol-induced psychotic disorder, alcohol withdrawal delirium, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, Korsakoff’s dementia, comorbid schizophrenia, or delusional disorder. Methods: This is a non-systematic, narrative review based on the relevant literature indexed in PubMed and Google Scholar databases [2000-2020]. Results: Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder is characterized by the presence of auditory hallucinations or delusions. In the state of alcohol withdrawal, tactile, visual hallucinations and delusions are common. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, caused by malnutrition secondary to chronic alcohol misuse, is characterized by the presence of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and a range of mental disturbances. The dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder rests on shared biological impairments, as shown by neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies. The subtype of the delusional disorder called Othello’s syndrome, or delusional jealousy based on false beliefs of infidelity, is often seen in the context of alcohol alone or alcohol and neurological disorder. Treatment for alcoholic disorders with psychotic symptoms are dietary, psychological, and pharmacological. Conclusions: There are a number of alcohol-related psychotic syndromes, each requiring its own specific treatment approach.",

      "abstract": "Various factors contribute to a predisposition towards the excessive consumption of alcohol: socio-demographic factors, a disturbed family background or certain neurological disorders in childhood, a family background of heavy drinking or total abstinence, or a genetic predisposition towards the biochemical reactions of excessive drinking. Alcohol dependence is the last of several stages which begin with drinking on \"social occasions\" during adolescence or even childhood, which may lead to certain people drinking excessively in certain social surroundings; this may easily become a habit if the subject moreover suffers from psychological problems inducing him to consume greater quantities more frequently to overcome inhibitions or to escape. This increased consumption leads in turn to psychological dependence, and toxicomania becomes apparent since if drinking is suddenly stopped, giving rise to neuro-vegetative disorders, these only disappear when further alcohol is consumed. This vicious circle is completed by psychological problems affecting personal relationships and professional activities. Thus for the alcoholic, for whom at the outset drinking was usually merely a social habit, the consumption of alcohol has become an escape from the reality of his situation, often drinking solely to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and therefore the appropriate therapy in these cases is detoxication.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

The psychiatrist depends on a carefully compiled case history and a differentiated psychodiagnostic. This may lead to a wrong assessment due to a lack of objectiveness. (2) There are a lot of legal areas where only the psychiatric or psychological expert opinion is required: i.e., the question of criminal responsibility during a trial, the assessment of legal capacity and the capability to will, for decisions about the custody of children etc. This is demonstrated with some cases as an example.",

While a person who was intoxicated may not be able to form the requisite specific intent to commit some offences, voluntary intoxication usually disentitles a person from an insanity or \"mental impairment\" defence. However, a person may also consume alcohol or use a substance without becoming intoxicated and the presence of alcohol, substances or metabolites of substances in a person's urine or blood is not conclusive when the question of intoxication is relevant. A jury (or a judge sitting without a jury) may require expert opinion evidence when cannabis or methamphetamine intoxication are implicated in the alleged offending.",

      "abstract": "In legal practice it is assumed that the ordinary man intends the natural consequences of his acts. When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

Not all alcohol abusers show alcoholic brain damage, since environmental and genetic influences, as well as an individual's acquired and inherent modifying factors, play important roles. This chapter is directed at the alcoholic brain damage induced by high alcohol intake over a long period of time <5-10 years. Chronic alcohol abusers during alcohol intoxication exhibit a variety of acute adverse effects which include ataxia of gait, slurred speech, prolonged reaction times, poor memory consolidation, impaired emotional modulation and compromised judgement. Overall this induces impaired judgement, blunted affect, poor insight, social withdrawal, reduced motivation, distractibility, and attention and impulse-control deficits. Ethanol has a modulating effect on immunity, inducing neuroinflammation, particularly when other stimulating molecules are present, which may be an important factor in the aetiology of alcoholic brain damage.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Panic disorder is defined in DSM-IV1 as \"The presence of recurrent panic attacks followed by at least one month of persistent concern about having another panic attack, worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attack, or a significant behavioral change related to the attacks.\" A panic attack is defined as \"a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four or more of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes.\" 1) Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; 2) sweating; 3) trembling or shaking; 4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; 5) feeling of choking; 6) chest pain or discomfort; 7) nausea or abdominal distress; 8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed or faint; 9) derealization or depersonalization; 10) fear of losing control or going crazy; 11) fear of dying; 12) paresthesias; 13) chills or hot flashes. The following hypotheses have been used to conceptualize panic disorder from a psychiatrist's perspective.",

Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

      "abstract": "When alcohol abuse occurs with depression, both the substance abuse and the mood disorder necessitate treatment. These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

      "title": "Critical Review of Alcohol, Alcoholism and the Withdrawal Symptoms I. Mechanisms of Addiction and Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Alcoholic beverages are socially accepted around the world, consumed mostly to socialize, celebrate, and relax. The pleasant effects of alcohol are attributed to (i) an increase in GABAergic (inhibitory signals), OPergic and 5HTergic (euphoric effects) neuronal activities and (ii) a decrease in DAergic ('want' signal or craving), Gluergic (excitatory signals), NEergic (stress signals) neuronal, and the HPA axis (stress hormones) activities. If alcohol drinking continues, the receptors are sensitized, resulting in development of tolerance when alcohol drinking must be increased to achieve desired effects. In genetically/Environmentally predisposed subjects, chronic alcohol drinking results in the development of addiction, characterized by a condition when alcohol caseation results in rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms including, but not limited to, alcohol craving and moderate to severe discomfort. Because pharmacotherapy alone or in combination with behavioral approaches is only modestly effective in treating alcoholism symptoms, there is an urgent need to development effective and safe therapies. At present, a lack of clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying addiction hinders possible development of new treatment strategies. Therefore, the aim of this article is to discuss the mechanisms underlying (i) the euphoric, relaxing and adverse effects of alcohol drinking and (ii) addiction and the withdrawal symptoms.",

      "title": "Persistent Psychosis After a Single Ingestion of “Ecstasy” (MDMA)",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

In bipolar disorders, both depressive and manic episodes occur sequentially. A manic episode is characterised as an abnormally excited mood that is experienced by a patient for a distinct period (at least a week). Diagnosis of mania requires that a patient’s work and social life be significantly affected, or that the patient needs hospitalisation. Diagnosis also requires the presence of three or more of the following symptoms: inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; decreased need for sleep; increased talkativeness; racing thoughts/ideas; distraction; increased goal-directed activity; excessive involvement in pleasurable activities [1].",

      "abstract": "Drugs used in sexual assault, which are also called as date rape drugs, are common phenomenon of crime in many countries. In a typical scenario, a perpetrator adds a date-rape drug which has sedative effect into alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person. After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as γ-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It is important to know what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug. In this study, we will present a general approach to date-rape drugs used in sexual assault.",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis.

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history. For differential diagnostic considerations not only organic causes, but also adverse drug reactions and a factitious genesis must be excluded.

El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento.

      "abstract": "Intellectual dysfunction, usually involving short-term memory, abstract reasoning, visuomotor coordination, intellectual flexibility, and spatial reasoning, is a well-documented finding among alcohol imbibers of various drinking styles. Despite the diversity of groups examined and the attempted control of variables other than alcohol consumption, little concensus has been reached with regard to the chronology of dysfunction (as related to lifetime drinking style, duration of alcoholism, quantity consumed per session, or type of potable). In many instances, diet, age, and even sex have outweighed the relative influence of alcohol in the degree of intellectual dysfunction. Morphologically, brain changes tend to be in the anterior/basal areas and may involve the third ventricle, diencephalic areas, and other focal variations. Cerebellar changes also are not uncommon yet may reflect a subgroup of alcoholics rather than a generalised trend. Generally, many intellectual deficits partially rebound rapidly within the first two or three weeks after cessation of drinking, with perhaps modest further improvement if sobriety is sustained for several months. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the alcoholic population and the potent effect of ancillary variables upon measures of intellectual functioning, control and matching of demographic factors is a paramount consideration. Demographic variables of primary concern include age, sex, socio-economic status, education, duration of alcoholism, quantity of alcohol consumed per session, diet, psychotropic medications, secondary psychiatric diagnoses, secondary medical diagnoses, exact duration of abstinence, and prior exposure to psychometric instruments.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

Dauerhafte kognitive Defizite allein aufgrund einer unmittelbaren neurotoxischen Wirkung des thanol sind sehr selten; sie sind meist mit neurologischen oder internistischen Alkoholfolgekrankheiten assoziiert bzw. der Alkohol wirkt als Kofaktor. Die neurobiologischen Korrelate sind nicht sehr spezifisch. Verschiedene pathogenetische Mechanismen werden diskutiert, die aus der Perspektive der Neurogenese besser verständlich werden. Eine besondere Rolle spielt das Korsakoff-Syndrom, wobei überkommene Vorstellungen zum Wernicke-Korsakoff-Komplex wahrscheinlich revidiert werden müssen. Nur Alkoholmissbrauch erhöht das Demenzrisiko, während moderater Alkoholkonsum mit einem gegenüber Abstinenz verminderten Risiko einhergeht. Der Terminus “Alkohol-assoziierte kognitive Beeinträchtigungen” (“alcohol-related cognitive impairment”) erscheint als übergeordnete Bezeichnung zweckmäßig.

      "title": "Role of Glutamate in Alcohol Withdrawal Kindling",
      "abstract": "It is well known that continued excessive alcohol consumption can lead to the development of physiological dependence. When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

      "title": "Sucht und Demenz",
      "abstract": "Regelmäßiger Konsum führt bei vielen Drogen zu leichten kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen, die unter Abstinenz noch einige Zeit fortbestehen können, aber zum großen Teil reversibel sind. Zum neuropsychologischen Vollbild einer Demenz wie auch zu bleibenden strukturellen Hirnschädigungen kommt es hingegen nur selten. Die größten Risiken dauerhafter struktureller Hirnschäden bergen Kokain, Amphetamine und Ecstasy, geringer ist die Gefahr bei Benzodiazepinen, Cannabis und Opiaten. Selbst beim Alkohol ist unklar, inwieweit die reine Alkoholwirkung zu irreversiblen Hirnschäden führt. Dies ist offenbar nur bei dauerhaften sehr hohen Blut-Alkohol-Konzentrationen der Fall, wahrscheinlich wirken häufig Entzugsyndrome verschlimmernd. Bedeutsamer sind die vielfältigen Alkoholfolge- bzw. -begleiterkrankungen. Dasselbe trifft für das Rauchen und Opiate zu. Beim Wernicke-Korsakoff-Syndrom und der HIV-Enzephalopathie handelt es sich nicht um direkte Folgen des Suchtmittels, sondern um indirekte Komplikationen. Die Wernicke-Enzephalopathie verläuft oft oligosymptomatisch bzw. mit „atypischen“ Symptomen, so dass sie sehr häufig nicht erkannt wird und dann unbemerkt in ein Korsakoff-Syndrom mündet. Suchtmittelkonsum und Sucht-Folgeerkrankungen können auf verschiedene Weise im Sinne der zerebralen Multimorbidität zur Entwicklung degenerativer Demenzerkrankungen beitragen. Diese Rolle des Alkoholmissbrauchs als Kofaktor ist epidemiologisch offenbar am wichtigsten, sie wird die mit zunehmendem Alter immer bedeutsamer. Geringfügiger bis mäßiger Alkoholkonsum ist nicht mit einem erhöhten Demenzrisiko verbunden. Schwerwiegender als die kognitiven Einbußen sind möglicherweise die Beeinträchtigungen der Lernfähigkeit durch chronischen Drogeneinfluss, die soziales Lernen, den Erwerb von Copingmechanismen und Stressbewältigungsfertigkeiten behindern und damit zu Persönlichkeitsveränderungen beitragen. Dies gilt bei Langzeitanwendung wohl auch für Benzodiazepine in therapeutischen Dosierungen. Die Gefahren sind umso größer, je jünger und unreifer das Gehirn ist. Außerdem besteht eine deutliche Beziehung zur kumulativen Dosis.",

      "title": "[Ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome].",
      "abstract": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in the hours or days after the cessation of alcohol drinking in an alcohol dependent patient. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionAlcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects.DefinitionThe American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "title": "Natural history of alcohol use disorders in liver transplant patients",
      "abstract": "A. Liver transplantation (LT) patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) often have the comorbid psychiatric disorder of alcohol dependence (AD). 1. Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

Self-medication of mood disorders with legal or illicit substances is highly prevalent. Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment. Many depressive symptoms may resolve with treatment of the substance use disorder. Independent mood disorders can be treated with behavioral therapy and standard pharmacological therapy. Some mood disorder medications are also effective for substance use disorders. Some substances that have historically been used recreationally are being studied as possible treatments for mood disorders.",

Depression, the most common mental disorder in later life, is a major precipitating factor in suicide. Alcoholism is another major precipitating factor in late-life suicide. Approximately one-third of all suicides are alcoholics. Many of the same factors which contribute to depression also increase the risk of alcoholism and/or suicide. Loss, stress, loneliness, low self-esteem, and feelings of anxiety, rejection, helplessness, and hopelessness characterize late life alcoholism and depression. Alcoholism, depression, and suicide form a deadly triangle.

Pharmacological therapies such as antidepressants and antipsychotics or also called neuroleptics are intend to reduce the frequency and severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenics. Treatment with antipsychotics which oftenly cause some side effects such as dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed. The results indicate that the gender variable did not provide significant results because of the p = 1.000. Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

The state of ebriety is a poor incentive to precise neurologic analysis and follow-up.

Among the specific complications, myopathies and strokes are described here because of their rarity compared to the more common epilepsy and withdrawal syndromes. The neurologic semiology of ebriety is reviewed, including recent pathophysiological acquisitions specifying the mechanism of functional disorders in regions susceptible to alcohol such as the cerebellum and the reticular formation.",

Selten sind paranoide Störungen, speziell der alkoholische Eifersuchtswahn, der manchmal als Residuum einer chronischen Alkoholhalluzinose persistiert und monosymptomatisch bleibt. Gefürchtet sind die resultierenden Gewaltdelikte. Die Therapie ist meist schwierig, Neuroleptika nur begrenzt wirksam.",

      "title": "Concurrent Alcohol and Tobacco Dependence: Mechanisms and Treatment",
      "abstract": "People who drink alcohol often also smoke and vice versa. Several mechanisms may contribute to concurrent alcohol and tobacco use. These mechanisms include genes that are involved in regulating certain brain chemical systems; neurobiological mechanisms, such as cross-tolerance and cross-sensitization to both drugs; conditioning mechanisms, in which cravings for alcohol or nicotine are elicited by certain environmental cues; and psychosocial factors (e.g., personality characteristics and coexisting psychiatric disorders). Treatment outcomes for patients addicted to both alcohol and nicotine are generally worse than for people addicted to only one drug, and many treatment providers do not promote smoking cessation during alcoholism treatment. Recent findings suggest, however, that concurrent treatment for both addictions may improve treatment outcomes. KEY WORDS: comorbidity; AODD (alcohol and other drug dependence); alcoholic beverage; tobacco in any form; nicotine; smoking; genetic linkage; cross-tolerance; AOD (alcohol and other drug) sensitivity; neurotransmitters; brain reward pathway; cue reactivity; social AODU (AOD use); cessation of AODU; treatment outcome; combined modality therapy; literature review Alcohol consumption and tobacco use are closely linked behaviors. Thus, not only are people who drink alcohol more likely to smoke (and vice versa) but also people who drink larger amounts of alcohol tend to smoke more cigarettes. Furthermore, patients diagnosed with dependence on one of the drugs also are commonly diagnosed with dependence on the other drug (e.g., Zacny 1990). In fact, smoking rates among alcoholics have been estimated to be as high as 90 percent, with approximately 70 percent of alcoholics smoking at least one pack of cigarettes per day (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 1998). Similarly, smokers are far more likely to consume alcohol than are nonsmokers, and smokers who are dependent on nicotine have a 2.7 times greater risk of becoming alcohol dependent than nonsmokers (e.g., Breslau 1995). Finally, although the smoking rate in the general population has gradually declined over the past three decades, the smoking rate among alcoholics has remained persistently high (e.g., Hays et al. 1999). Concerns about the concurrent use of alcohol and tobacco are particularly salient given the detrimental impact of this drug combination on the individual and on society. For instance, alcohol and tobacco when used together increase the risk of various forms of cancer (e.g., mouth and esophageal cancer), as well as cardiovascular disease, more than use of either drug alone (e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1989). The concurrent use of both drugs by pregnant women can also result in more severe prenatal damage and neurocognitive deficits in their offspring than use of either drug alone (e.g., Martin et al. 1997). Furthermore, the combined use of alcohol and tobacco among adolescents is more predictive of illicit drug use and various personal and social problems among this population than use of either drug alone (e.g., Hoffman et al. 2001). Given the frequent occurrence and broad implications of concurrent alcohol and tobacco use, research and clinical efforts clearly must focus on people who abuse both drugs. Over the past decade, interactions between alcohol and tobacco have indeed received growing attention from both basic and clinical researchers. Alcohol dependence and smoking, individually and in combination, are complex forms of addictive behavior that may be influenced by a variety of genetic, neurobiological, conditioning, and psychosocial mechanisms, as described in this article. In addition to these mechanisms, the article discusses issues related to the treatment of alcoholic smokers. This overview will necessarily be selective; for instance, there is little mention of sociocultural (e.g., economic and demographic) factors that also may contribute to concurrent use of alcohol and tobacco (see Bobo and Husten 2000). …",

It overlaps with frontal brain aging consequences. Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Co-occurring Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Substance use disorders commonly co-occur with psychiatric disorders. Recognition of psychiatric symptoms, especially suicidal ideation, is essential. Factors such as substance use or withdrawal, related psychosocial stressors, and co-occurring somatic health problems complicate the diagnostic process. Addressing psychiatric symptoms is essential to optimizing treatment of substance use disorders. Medications can help but may be unnecessary once substance use is stabilized. Other approaches include counseling, psychotherapy, case coordination, and inpatient or residential care. There are additional issues that arise with specific psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders (depression and bipolar), anxiety and trauma-related disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), psychotic disorders, personality disorders, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from a heightening of the apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

      "title": "Lethargie bei Hungernden; Überlebensstrategie oder klinische Depression? Kognitive und psychovegetative Depressionssymptome im Hungerstoffwechsel unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Hunger und andere Formen der Mangelernahrung konnen verschiedene Konsequenzen fur den Organismus nach sich ziehen, wie zum Beispiel eine Herzinsuffizienz, eine Fettleber, Formen der Protein-Energie-Malnutrition wie Kwashiorkor und Marasmus und schlimmstenfalls den Tod. Bisher weniger grundlich untersucht sind die Folgen extremer Unterernahrung fur die Psyche. Menschen, die unter Hunger leiden, wirken antriebs- und kraftlos und lethargisch. Man konnte vermuten, dass sie depressiv sind. Aber erfullen sie wirklich die Diagnosekriterien einer klinischen Depression? Die Beantwortung dieser Frage konnte wichtige Hinweise darauf bergen, welche langfristigen Konsequenzen etwa auf eine Hungersnot oder ein weiteres Ansteigen der Pravalenz der Anorexia Nervosa folgen konnten. Dies konnte sowohl relevant fur die Arbeit von Arzten, Oecotrophologen, Psychologen und anderen therapeutischen Berufsgruppen sein als auch, auf einer globalen Ebene, bedeutsame Informationen fur die okonomischen Folgen beinhalten, die auf eine von Mangelernahrung betroffene Gesellschaft zukommen. So konnte eine durch Hunger induzierte erhohte Depressionspravalenz weitere Kosten fur das wahrscheinlich ohnehin gebeutelte Gesundheitssystem eines betroffenen Staats nach sich ziehen. Zudem ist es fur Menschen, die zusatzlich zu den korperlichen Entbehrungen des Hungers unter Symptomen der Antriebslosigkeit, Hoffnungslosigkeit, Interesse- und Freudlosigkeit leiden, um einiges schwerer, Kraft und Motivation fur den Wiederaufbau eines Landes zu finden. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschaftigt sich daher damit, ob Mangelernahrung zum Entstehen einer Depression fuhrt und welcher Art die gefundenen Symptome sind. Mangelernahrung ist ein weltweit verbreitetes Phanomen, das verschiedene Ursachen haben kann. Wahrend Hunger ein groses Problem in armeren Landern darstellt, entwickeln vor allem in den industrialisierten Landern immer mehr Menschen Essstorungen. Die in dieser Arbeit formulierten Hypothesen wurden anhand einer Zusammenfassung der Literatur und der wichtigsten Studien uberpruft. Es wurde gefunden, dass Mangelernahrung nicht zu einer klinisch diagnostizierbaren Depression, aber dennoch zu ausgepragten depressiven Symptomen fuhrt, die sich nach einer Normalisierung der Nahrungsaufnahme zuruckbilden. Diese Auswirkungen beschranken sich nicht auf einen somatischen Symptombereich, sondern finden sich ebenso in psychischen und kognitiven Gebieten. Weitere insbesondere experimentelle Forschungsarbeiten zur Kontrolle dieser Ergebnisse waren wertvoll fur die Weiterentwicklung des Verstandnisses der Interaktion von Mangelernahrung und Symptomen psychischer Erkrankungen.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "abstract": "By far, the most common reasons for decline in school performance include anything from psychosocial stressors (divorce, death of a loved one or pet, new school, or bullying) to psychiatric disease (depression). These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

Many people have tried to ‘drown their sorrows’ in ethanol, which provides the most familiar example of the phenomenon. There are prescribed drugs used specifically to treat anxiety, depression, psychosis and other psychiatric (‘mental’) diseases. These drugs are intended to alter the subject’s feelings or state of mind therapeutically. Many more drugs can cause psychiatric disturbance as an adverse effect. The pleasurable feelings engendered by some drugs and chemicals can also lead to their non-medicinal use and abuse.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "title": "Infant Precursors to Autism",
      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

      "title": "Where do we go in occupational neuroepidemiology?",
      "abstract": "Early knowledge about the neurotoxic effects of occupational exposures appeared through clinical observations. The observed effects were more or less acute and concerned exposure to metals such as lead and mercury or solvents like carbon disulfide and trichloroethylene. With time, however, also more chronic and clinically less obvious effects of neurotoxic agents have been assessed through modern examination methods and systematic studies of larger groups. Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1.5% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and approximately 61,500 deaths involved stimulant use in 2022. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction, stroke) and psychiatric (agitation, delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. Contingency management has been shown to be effective for stimulant use disorder. Other psychosocial modalities may reduce stimulant use among selected individuals; these include individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and community reinforcement. Medications may provide modest benefits, including bupropion with or without naltrexone, topiramate, mirtazapine, and prescription stimulants. Harm reduction interventions such as syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased complications related to stimulant use. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "abstract": "After aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, acute subdural hematoma (SDH) is a rare consequence. SDH has never been linked to an unruptured intracavernous aneurysm. The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

La inespecificidad de estas alteraciones ha hecho que muchas de estas modificaciones comportamentales sean consideradas, erróneamente, como signos típicos del envejecimiento “normal”. No obstante, estas pueden ser reflejo de un proceso patológico cerebral que provoca deterioro progresivo de las funciones cognitivas en perros geriátricos. Recientemente, fue descrita una enfermedad conocida como Síndrome de Disfunción Cognitiva de perros senior o “enfermedad de Alzheimer del perro”, debido a las similitudes clínicas y patológicas con esta enfermedad en humanos. Los animales afectados desarrollan cambios morfofuncionales en diferentes zonas cerebrales, lo que probablemente conduce a la aparición de cambios asociados al decline cognitivo, es decir, disminución en la capacidad de recopilar información, procesarla, retenerla y tomar decisiones, lo que termina provocando efectos deletéreos sobre la calidad de vida del paciente afectado al no lograr desenvolverse normalmente en su medio. Dada la inespecificidad de los signos clínicos, la anamnesis y los test comportamentales han sido considerados como las principales herramientas diagnósticas para identificar este síndrome. Por otra parte, debido a que aún no han sido plenamente establecidos los aspectos etiopatológicos, los mecanismos implicados en el desarrollo de esta neuropatología aún siguen inconclusos, por lo tanto, no son muchas las estrategias terapéuticas disponibles, de las cuales solo la selegilina ha sido aprobada por la FDA.",

The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol and other psychoactive drugs are oftentimes implicated in legal cases. A pertinent question herein is whether such substances might adversely affect testimonies of victims, eyewitnesses, or suspects by propelling the formation of false memory and increasing susceptibility to suggestion. In the current review, we amassed all available evidence on the effects of intoxication on false memory formation and suggestibility, including the substances alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, stimulants, hallucinogens, and antipsychotics. Our review indicated that alcohol and cannabis under certain conditions increased the susceptibility to false memories and/or suggestion with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. When intoxicated during an event, alcohol is most likely to increase this susceptibility at high intoxication levels or after a delay, whereas cannabis exerts detrimental effects during acute intoxication but not necessarily once sober. For other substances, ecologically valid research separating different memory phases is needed. Overall, differences between substances regarding false memory effects exist, suggesting that a nuanced approach is needed when dealing with intoxicated individuals in a legal context.",

In some instances the craving for alcohol precedes the paroxysm or epileptic fit like an aura or premonition. Sometimes the convulsion is intensified and increased by alcohol, or in other instances it may be neutralized and the direction of the symptom changed. The sudden maniacal impulse to become narcotized by alcohol, as seen in the dipsomaniac and periodic inebriates, closely resembles epilepsy.

Patients with depressive symptoms or in a major depressive episode may also be suffering from another nonmood psychiatric disorders as alcoholism, anxiety or eating disorders. Many general medical conditions which are link with depression are illustrated with the examples of cancer, coronary artery disease, endocrinologic diseases, dementia, stroke and chronic fatigue syndrome. When depression and another psychiatric or medical conditions occur together, it is important to provide to the practitioner guidelines for the decision to treat one of the two disorders.

The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

Acute alcohol poisoning is too familiar to warrant further discussion, and its consequences as they affect the nervous system, are well known. An acute alcoholic myopathy is a rare but striking illness. Alcohol itself is unlikely to be the responsible toxin, for improvement of the neuropathy can occur by restoration of normal diet despite continued drinking. Fits are a symptom of an abnormal cerebral cortex, so can be caused by many of the consequences of alcoholism. A small proportion of alcoholics develop bilateral progressive visual impairment, associated with characteristic central or centro-caecal scotoma and optic atrophy. Personality, intellect, perception and cognition are some criteria that distinguish one individual from another. Dementia refers to a global loss of all such higher mental function.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects. Definition The American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

Their neurological complications are principally: psychic alterations, seizures and stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic). The latter are the most important in the clinical practice. Their capacity to produce transit arterial hypertension and cerebral vascular constriction could be the physiopathological substrate of such alterations. Angiographic studies have shown lesions suggesting vasculopathy. In the last ten years cocaine abuse has become an authentic epidemic. We have reviewed its neurological complications, particularly the vascular ones--42 hemorrhagic and 24 ischemic--and the following conclusions were drawn: it should be considered as a risk factor in the younger age group; a short period of time between the last drug dose and the clinical picture is frequently seen; clinical features may appear with the first drug administration; no characteristic lesion in relation to the way of administration or consumption time was elicited.",

All physicians need to have a high index of suspicion for alcoholism, since the diagnosis of alcohol dependence is frequently overlooked.

Common alcohol-related complications requiring treatment include: (1) clinicopathologic disorders, often associated with the gastroenterologic or cardiorespiratory systems, including alcoholic cirrhosis, (2) peripheral myoneural effects, (3) neuropsychiatric complications (delirium tremens, acute alcoholic hallucinosis, Korsakoff's psychosis, alcoholic dementia), and (4) psychosocial disability.",

      "title": "A Review of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "title": "1699 – Long lasting personality changes after the onset of dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Across various cultures, dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage (as detected by conventional structural brain imaging). In a substantial number of cases, the memory impairment follows a chronic course. Sometimes dissociative amnesia occurs on a background of a personality disorder (narcissistic or borderline). Other times, amnesia itself triggers long lasting personality changes. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition among health care providers of the spectrum of the personality changes that may accompany chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically, neuropsychologically and and neuroradiologically. Changes in personality dimensions occur after the onset of amnesia. These may involve affectivity, perception (e.g. impaired self face or face-emotion processing), cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behaviour (e.g. changing in eating, smoking, drinking or working habits). The observed personality changes may represent a consequence of amnesia. Functional imaging studies show metabolic changes in dissociative amnesia in brain areas involved in conscious mnemonic processing. Several structures engaged in processing within episodic-autobiographical memory system were also implicated in self and reward-related processing. Alternatively, the personality changes may be viewed as being pivotal in the development and maintenance of dissociative amnesia; this personality shift may subsequently lead to enduring changes in ways of cognitive processing, self-processing, perception and affect.",

Some of the most common mental disorders due to alcohol abuse are: Memory disorder: Hazardous amounts of alcohol may cause intoxication, impairment of memory so that the person who took a drunken accident may not remember the event. Periods of memory impairment in those with a history of alcohol addiction would also happen in binge drinkers. Memory impairment may happen all days or most part of the day. Depression: Depression may be caused by long term alcohol abuse. On the other hand, in some cases, depressed people have tendency towards abusing alcohol, but it may improve their symptoms. The depression that can lead to more alcohol abuse and alcohol abuse can lead to depression, so the exact sequence of two modes should be revealed. Suicide: Based on current evaluation, 6 to 20 percent of alcoholics committed suicide due to   harmful feature of alcohol. Evidence of suicidal behavior or intention to harm themselves is more prevalent than normal people in their age. Personality disorder: Personality disorder is one of the problems that often occur in large proportion of alcoholic people. It can interfere with their self-centered manner. Excessive alcohol abuse is rare but serious complication of pathological jealousy. Suspicion to partners is also very common among these people. Sexual Dysfunction: People who consume alcohol for a long period, often complain of sexual and erectile dysfunction and their ejaculation are usually delayed. Effects of alcohol on the nervous system or vascular disorders associated with excessive abuse of alcohol and sexual dysfunction in men may have been involved. Hallucination: Transient vision or hearing hallucinations are seen in some abusers. Even in the rare disorder called alcoholic hallucinations, severe threatening voices is usually heard. Some patients hear loud voices and others are also experienced violence in these sounds. These people are delusional about the possibility of the harm and injury.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships.

      "title": "Alcohol Dependence Conceptualized as a Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder is a chronically relapsing disorder that involves (1) compulsivity to seek and take alcohol, (2) difficulty in limiting alcohol intake, and (3) emergence of a negative emotional state (e.g., dysphoria, anxiety, irritability) in the absence of alcohol. Alcohol addiction encompasses a three-stage cycle that becomes more intense as alcohol use progresses: <italic>binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect</italic>, and <italic>preoccupation/anticipation</italic>. These stages engage neuroadaptations in brain circuits that involve the basal ganglia (reward hypofunction), extended amygdala (stress sensitization), and prefrontal cortex (executive function disorder). This chapter discusses key neuroadaptations in the hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic stress systems and the critical role of glucocorticoid receptors. These neuroadaptations contribute to negative emotional states that powerfully drive compulsive alcohol drinking and seeking. These changes in association with a disruption of prefrontal cortex function that lead to cognitive deficits and poor decision making contribute to the chronic relapsing nature of alcohol dependence.",

      "title": "Experience with Drugs and Driving in Queensland, Australia",
      "abstract": "The effect of any one psychoactive drug on an individual is a function of its interaction with that individual; for this reason, the effect upon one person may not be the same as on another person. When two or more drugs are given at the same time, their effect may be one of antagonism, synergism or potentiation. The effects of a psychotropic drug (ataxia, incoordination, altered level of consciousness or awareness, disturbances of vision and increased reaction time) must surely impair the skills required for safe driving. Many prescribed drugs acting principally on the central nervous system are capable of impairing driving performance: analgesics, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics and tranquillizers. Other prescribed drugs: anti-histamines, hypotensive agents, hypoglycaemic substances may produce undesirable side effects which impair driving performance. In Queensland if breath analysis indicated a BAC too low to account for a driver's behaviour, a doctor is called to examine the driver, and samples of blood and urine are forwarded to a central laboratory. If the blood concentration of a drug equals or exceeds the accepted therapeutic level of the particular substance, the driver is considered to be under the influence of the drug. The most dangerous period is during the initial stage of taking a prescribed drug. Psychotropic drugs taken in prescribed dosage may initially produce drowsiness, ataxia, impaired judgement and increased reaction time. After a period of time, tolerance to the drug develops, with marked reduction in unwanted side effects. The most common drugs include morphine, pethidine, methadone, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The common purpose for such abuse is to get high -a stage of unreality characterized by euphoria and/or hallucinations, either visual or auditory or both. Intoxication by any of these drugs produces severe impairment of driving skills. An exaggerated pharmacological effect commonly occurs when alcohol is taken at the same time as another psychoactive drug. Benzodiazepines are the prescribed drug most commonly involved in instances of driving impairment, both alone and in combination with alcohol. Some drugs commonly associated with impaired driving performance are: mandrax, methadone and diazepam. The extent of the contribution of drivers impaired by drugs and drug-alcohol interaction to traffic accidents has not yet been defined. It will not be defined until all countries enact effective legislation to enable such drivers to be identified. The use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs in Australia has been increasing steadily over the past few years, and continues to increase. It is impossible to obtain accurate figures on the consumption of psychotropic drugs in Australia. (Shortened Author Abstract/TRRL)",

      "abstract": "Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated in people with co-factors such as depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and bulimia/bingeing. These behavioral or cognitive patterns may be adaptive or neutral in the conditions under which we evolved but maladaptive in environments requiring alertness for extended periods, where a fully mobilized fight-or-flight response is inappropriate, and where food availability makes lack of an \"appestat\" a liability. Such conditions are amenable to management by nicotine because of its ability to produce small but reliable adjustments in relevant cognitive and behavioral functions. Moreover, symptomatology may be unmasked or exacerbated by nicotine abstinence, persisting beyond the usual time-course for nicotine withdrawal, which may explain the particular attraction of smoking and the difficulty these individuals experience in quitting without necessarily requiring that they be more nicotine-dependent. The implications are: (1) a better understanding of the evolutionary psychobiology of smoking may promote development of tailored interventions for smokers with co-factors; (2) nicotine may have therapeutic applications for non-smokers with co-factors; (3) because smoking has a fairly high heritability index, and because of evidence of assortative mating, special prevention efforts targeting children of smokers with co-factors, as well as early identification of the co-factor itself, may be needed.",

Consumption seems to be driven and maintained for desired effects on cognitive or emotional states. ‘Drug use’ in some situations is seen as socially acceptable such as getting a caffeine ‘hit’ from a morning cup of coffee to ‘get going’ or drinking alcohol as part of a social occasion. However, for some individuals and for some substances, drug use risks adverse consequences for brain function and possible enduring harm. This chapter will focus on how brain function may be altered as a consequence of drug use and describe the current understanding of the neurobiology of drugs of abuse and how this may be related to neuropsychiatric consequences. Drugs can produce neuropsychiatric effects acutely during intoxication or withdrawal, and also after chronic exposure, with effects which may or may not be enduring with abstinence.",

In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

Instances of mental instability incorporate despondency, uneasiness problems, schizophrenia, dietary issues and habit- forming practices. Many individuals have emotional wellness worries now and again. In any case, an emotional well-being concern turns into a mental instability when continuous signs and manifestations cause regular pressure and influence your capacity to work. A dysfunctional behavior can make you hopeless and can mess up your everyday life, for example, at school or work or seeing someone. Much of the time, manifestations can be made do with a blend of prescriptions and talk treatment.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

Different substances can be classified based on their effects on the central nervous system. These effects vary depending on the substance and can produce everything from increased energy and euphoria to profound sedation. In general, while the effects vary significantly, the initial stages of substance use disorders are characterized by positive reinforcement, where individuals experience a sense of well-being or euphoria with use. As physiological and psychological dependence progresses, an individual experiences negative reinforcement where substances primarily relieve dysphoria and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The public health relevance of hangover is in its potential effects on occupational safety and performance. Apart from pharmacological effects of ethanol and congeners, psychosocial factors also contribute to morning-after feelings, particularly the emotions of shame and guilt. Tobacco smoking increases the hangover's incidence and severity, explained by pharmacological effects of nicotine and other smoke constituents. During a drinking binge, many people would smoke more than usual; some intermittent smokers or those who gave up would restart. The hangover \"curing\" with beer or vodka the next morning (hair of the dog) may contribute to negative affectivity in the long run, as it implies a cycle of alcohol consumption and shame. Some individuals experience a temporary symptomatic relief after a hair of the dog drink. According to our observations, if the \"curing\" is accompanied by smoking, the elevated mood in some people would more easily shift to dysphoria, irritation or depression. Psychological mechanisms thereof are discussed here. Besides, the problem of smoking in psychiatric hospitals is briefly discussed. In conclusion, smoking can exacerbate hangover symptoms through both toxicological and psychosocial mechanisms. The problem of smoking in the settings of alcoholism and mental health problems should be further investigated.",

Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

In this chapter, some classic histologic findings in acute and chronic poisoning (including substance abuse) are presented. The determination of cause and manner of death in a poisoning requires a careful summation of circumstance, toxicology, and autopsy. Toxicology results are usually necessary, but alone are not sufficient for forming an opinion on cause and manner. Many variables, including postmortem redistribution, post-exposure survival, and overlap between therapeutic and toxic ranges, introduce uncertainty in the interpretation of postmortem drug levels. Gross and microscopic findings at autopsy can be supportive of acute and/or chronic substance abuse or may show unexpected sequelae of chronic substance abuse (e.g., infective endocarditis). Sometimes histology may be the first clue in a case of poisoning. An example of this is finding oxalate crystals in the kidneys of an otherwise unremarkable autopsy, as ethylene glycol is not detected by most toxicology laboratories in routine screening.",

Clinical manifestations of the AWS begin as soon as the alcohol consumption is interrupted or diminished after a long period of ingestion of great quantities of alcohol. The clinical manifestations include symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity, like sweating, tachycardia over 100 bpm, tremor, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, transitive visual, tactile, or hearing hallucinations, or even illusions, psychomotor agitation, anxiety and epileptic crisis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The core problem of addicts is addiction and not the other mental disorders that may be present. This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

In the great majority of cases consciousness remains unclouded, judgment fairly clear, memory good and the moral sense normal, until the end or very near the end. Emotional control, when we consider that almost always the patient, if an adult, knows he is suffering from a very serious disease, is usually better than would be expected. When, then, mental symptoms do occur, three questions arise: (1) Is the abnormal mental state a mere accidental complication, merely happening at the time of the tetanus and in no way caused by it? (2) Is it due to the medication employed? (3) Is it the direct result of the exhaustion produced by the disease or a result of a secondary intoxication set up by the primary intoxication of the tetanus bacillus?

      "abstract": "La toxicité cérébrale du cannabis est marquée principalement par des effets cognitifs, addictifs et psychotomimétiques. Troubles cognitifs Plusieurs études ont montré que l’administration aiguë de Δ-9-THC, principal principe actif du cannabis, et que la consommation régulière de cannabis entraînaient des troubles de l’attention, de la mémoire, en particulier de la mémoire de travail et de la mémoire épisodique ainsi que des troubles des fonctions exécutives. Ces troubles ont un impact sur l’apprentissage, les acquisitions scolaires, la conduite d’un véhicule et les tâches complexes. Ils sont liés à la dose, à la fréquence, à la durée d’exposition et à l’âge de la première consommation. Ils peuvent disparaître après sevrage, mais des anomalies durables s’observent chez les sujets ayant débuté leur consommation avant l’âge de 15 ans. Effets addictifs La fréquence sur la vie entière de la dépendance au cannabis, caractérisée essentiellement par le craving , la perte de contrôle de la consommation et le retentissement important sur la vie familiale/professionnelle/sociale est, d’après certaines études, de 1 % en population générale. Le syndrome de sevrage, décrit en 2004, pourrait être inclus dans le DSM-5. Effets psychotomimétiques Fréquents, les symptômes psychotiques induits par la consommation de cannabis (idées de référence, de persécution) disparaissent spontanément dans les 24 heures. Ils durent parfois plusieurs semaines dans les pharmacopsychoses. Neuf études longitudinales ont montré que les sujets qui avaient fumé du cannabis avaient deux fois plus de risque environ que les sujets abstinents, de présenter ultérieurement des troubles psychotiques. Le risque, dose-dépendant, est plus élevé lorsque la consommation de cannabis a débuté avant l’âge de 15 ans et chez les sujets qui ont des antécédents familiaux de troubles psychotiques. L’évolution de la schizophrénie est aggravée par la consommation de cannabis. Toxicité cérébrale du cannabis Elle est liée à l’interaction du Δ-9-THC sur les récepteurs cannabinoïdes cérébraux CB1, localisés principalement dans l’hippocampe, le cervelet, le cortex frontal, le striatum et les ganglions de la base. Plusieurs études ont retrouvé que la consommation de cannabis pouvait interférer avec le système endocannabinoïde cérébral lors de la maturation du cerveau à l’adolescence. Elle favorise aussi des troubles vasculaires cérébraux. Les études d’imagerie cérébrale ont retrouvé que les effets du cannabis, modérés en cas d’usage simple, étaient marqués chez les consommateurs réguliers par une diminution dose-dépendante de la densité de substance grise au niveau de l’hippocampe, des régions parahippocampiques et de l’amygdale.",

Their proneness to somatization may result in medical overinvestigation that can add an iatrogenic component to their illnesses; and their ‘affect storms’ or difficulty in relinquishing unhealthy affect regulatory behaviours, such as alcohol abuse or binge eating, may lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and helplessness in their treating physicians, nurses, or psychotherapists.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness. Further controlled studies would be required to clarify the aetiological significance of the drug in these conditions.",

The great prevalence of depression in alcoholics constitutes an important clinical issue, because alcoholic subjects with a coexisting depression exhibit heavier alcohol abuse, severer physical damage and greater liability to both psychotropic drug abuse and overdose behaviour than non-depressive alcoholics. The former also experience more frequent and severer relapses and are at greater risk of suicide. The nature of the relationship between alcohol dependence and depressive disorders is of considerable theoretical significance. Three possible non-mutually exclusive types of association are discussed: (1) the ingestion of alcohol may be an attempt at self-medication of depressive symptoms; (2) depression and alcohol abuse may, independently of each other, be attributable to an underlying, possibly genetic, factor; (3) depression may be a result of alcoholism: either induced by heavy alcohol consumption, as a consequence of alcohol withdrawal or as a psychoreactive phenomenon. Clinical guidelines for pharmaco- and psychotherapy of depression in patients suffering from alcoholism are outlined.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Symptoms commonly include hallucinations, mostly of the auditory type, and affective disturbances, in a background of clear consciousness. In this case series, four subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption were evaluated for hallucinatory symptoms after chronic alcohol intake. All of them had auditory hallucinations, with an anxious affect and no cognitive deficits. Only one case had visual hallucinations. The psychotic symptoms in all the patients were completely remitted with antipsychotics. Resumption of alcohol consumption increases the risk of relapse. The pathophysiology of alcoholic hallucinosis is not yet established and needs to be studied further for better diagnosis and management.",

The revealed mental disorders on different stages of poisoning were less differentiated in the acute period (clouded consciousness, coma) and most diverse in pre- and postcomatose stages, where they were characterized by disturbed consciousness, hallucinatory and delusional experiences, epileptiformal syndromes, emotional, motor and other disturbances. The symptomatology depended upon the type of medical drug, intensity of medical procedures, the mental or boderline disease itself which influences the clinical picture of every stage of the intoxication.",

Although certain epilepsy syndromes, such as infantile spasms, are associated with mental retardation or progressive intellectual decline, others typically are associated with normal development. Children who have \"absence\" attacks, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and benign Rolandic seizures, for example, generally are not impaired cognitively.

      "abstract": "Psychological traumas may occur during childhood in the form of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and/or emotional neglect. Trauma may be experienced when a person experiences serious loss or his/her life is under grave threat. If such traumatic event is neither dealt effectively nor resolved completely, it may predispose such a person to development of mental health issues such as drug dependence including alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS). Persons who experience or suffer from childhood psychological trauma tend to consume alcohol in order to cope with their trauma related experiences. Hence, generally, onset of alcohol dependence is preceded by the occurrence of childhood psychological trauma(s). Childhood psychological trauma especially emotional abuse acts as a risk factor for the development of alexithymia in later life among persons with alcohol dependence. Alexithymia is a state of emotional dysregulation, which is characterized by the triad of difficulty in identifying one's own feelings, difficulty in distinguishing between the physical sensation and emotional arousal, and difficulty in explaining one's own feelings to others, which is known as externally oriented style of thinking. Alexithymia is itself a risk factor for the development of ADS. Thus, both childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia play a significant role in the development of ADS. Findings of the present study showed that childhood psychological trauma(s), alexithymia, and ADS are interconnected. The present study findings conclude that significant relationship exists between childhood psychological traumas, alexithymia, and ADS.",

Alcoholics do not show any great affinity for psychiatrists and may openly resent being considered psychiatric patients. This is an attitude that they unfortunately share with most nonalcoholics; therefore some tact is required in referring them for treatment. If the alcoholic demonstrates abnormal behavior, appears depressed, or evidences a disturbance in his thinking (most frequently, ill-founded or illogical suspicions or grandiose opinions), he should certainly be examined psychiatrically, since in such cases the drinking may only be symptomatic of a severe underlying mental disturbance.

Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

Adverse effects of antidepressant drugs may be of psychic type: anxiety, sleep disorders, emergence of suicidal tendencies and reduction of inhibition, induced mania, mental confusion and delirium. They may be neurological: tremor, epilepsy, dyskinesia, cognitive disturbance. They may affect the digestive system: mouth dryness, hepatitis, constipation. Cardiovascular effects are very important and must be prevented: lowered blood pressure, cardiac rhythm disorders, ECG modifications. Side effects may also affect the genitor-urinary system. The risk of glaucoma decompensation induced by increased eye-pressure is very important. Metabolic disorders such as weight gain are to be taken into account. In case of massive absorption, the risk of fatal cardiogenic shock or arrhythmia is to be considered, what necessitates early implementation of systematic ECG control.",

Cognitive changes often improve with abstinence time and with age. However, others persist in time. These changes may influence the treatment and can lead to relapse, so it is necessary to include in the therapeutic process the assessment, as well as the stimulation and rehabilitation of these functions. Two studies were conducted in order to discriminate the variables that influence the existence or not of deficits in individuals with alcohol consumption. One of the findings consists in the existence of cognitive deficits, especially at an attention and language level, and to some extent changes in this area were more significant in older and those with less time of abstinence.",

Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

Using the case of Mr E, an older, moderate to heavy drinker experiencing memory difficulty, the diagnostic considerations, which include mild cognitive impairment, early Alzheimer dementia, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and \"alcoholic dementia,\" are discussed. These disorders are not mutually exclusive, and in a patient with either mild cognitive impairment or dementia, the contributory role of alcohol can be difficult to determine. In fact, epidemiological studies suggest that mild to moderate intake of alcohol actually reduces the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer dementia. Appropriate management includes measures to reduce alcohol dependence (eg, behavioral or pharmacological therapy) and to delay progression of the cognitive impairment (eg, engaging in healthy behaviors such as cognitive leisure activities).",

Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

      "abstract": "‘If I can’t feel, if I can’t move, if I can’t think, and I can’t care, then what conceivable point is there in living?’ (Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness) Mood is a person’s subjective emotional state. According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

It is unsure if the memory deficits that result from drug abuse persist forever as study examining memory impairments after more than a month's abstinence of drug use is not found. Conclusion: Therefore, it is incorrect to say that drug users or ex-drug users are incapable of learning; instead, as a result of neurological changes in the brain caused by chronic drug use, learning may take more time and effort for them as compared to non-drug users.",

La alucinosis es una forma infrecuente de psicosis organica subaguda que sigue al alcoholismo cronico. Consiste en alucinaciones auditivas con un nivel de conciencia normal, y generalmente tiene buen pronostico con el tratamiento adecuado. Es primordial diferenciarlo del delirium tremens y otros cuadros psicoticos mas graves. En la celotipia el sujeto sufre delirio de celos, siendo fundamental determinar el riesgo de agresividad hacia la pareja y poder actuar consecuentemente. Los diferentes estudios de comorbilidad realizados senalan la alta probabilidad de que un alcoholico padezca a lo largo de su vida algun tipo de trastorno mental. Se revisan aqui las distintas posibilidades de relacion entre los trastornos comorbidos y el trastorno por uso del alcohol, la prevalencia de las distintas patologias coexistentes posibles, asi como la importancia, impacto y consecuencias de la patologia dual en estos pacientes. EnglishNowadays, alcoholic hallucinosis and jealousy delusion, not so long ago considered as independent entities, are now dealt with, in the majority of the most acknowledged diagnostic classifications, in the category of alcohol missuse induced psychotic disorders (with a prevailing presence of hallucinations or delusion). On the one hand, hallucinosis is an infrequent type of subacute organic psychosis following chronic or ingrained alcoholism, consisting of auditory hallucinations while in normal levels of consciousness. It generally has a good prognosis with the appropiate treatment. It is absolutely essential to distinguish and differenciate this disorder from delirium tremens and others with a more serious prognosis, and also another psychotic episodes. On the other hand, in jealousy delusion the patient experiences or suffers from episodes of pathological and irrational jealousy – being fundamental to establish potential risks of physical agressive behaviour towards his or her couple in order to be able to cope and act in accordance -. Surveys on the issue of comorbidity show that there is a high degree of probability for an alcoholic to suffer from some type of mental disorder in lifetime. Finally, this paper aims to review the different possibilities of interrelation between comorbid disorders and alcohol dependence; the prevailing importance of the different coexisting pathologies that may be possible; and also the importance, impact and consequences of the dual pathology in these patients.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "Clinical entities listed as mood disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) relevant to depression in elderly patients include 1) bipolar disorder, 2) major depressive disorder (with or without psychotic features), and 3) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "title": "Nicotine withdrawal versus other drug withdrawal syndromes: similarities and dissimilarities",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal are similar to those of other drug withdrawal syndromes: anxiety, awakening during sleep, depression, difficulty concentrating, impatience, irritability/anger and restlessness. Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

There are many reasons behind a man gets addicted to these substances such as recreation purpose, drugs used for long time for treatment of any disorder and gets addicted, unemployment, stress, emotions, professional pressure and social status. It provides enjoyable feelings which results in creating a strong urge to use the substances again and again. These drugs can cause physical dependence or psychological dependence or both. Over time, drug tolerance is produced which means to get the same effect more quantity of the drug is needed. These substances are very harmful physically, mentally, financially and socially too. If someone suddenly terminates using these substances after heavy or long term use, the body needs time to recover and number of withdrawal symptoms arises. These withdrawal symptoms can’t be treated by medications only but it needs counselling and support as well.

      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

      "abstract": "In many alcoholics, the severity of withdrawal symptoms increases after repeated withdrawal episodes. This exacerbation may be attributable to a kindling process. Kindling is a phenomenon in which a weak electrical or chemical stimulus, which initially causes no overt behavioral responses, results in the appearance of behavioral effects, such as seizures, when it is administered repeatedly. Both clinical and experimental evidence support the existence of a kindling mechanism during alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures, result from neurochemical imbalances in the brain of alcoholics who suddenly reduce or cease alcohol consumption. These imbalances may be exacerbated after repeated withdrawal experiences. The existence of kindling during withdrawal suggests that even patients experiencing mild withdrawal should be treated aggressively to prevent the increase in severity of subsequent withdrawal episodes. Kindling also may contribute to a patient's relapse risk and to alcohol-related brain damage and cognitive impairment.",

Over the past several decades, a number of definitions of drug addiction have been used. Although some of the historically earliest definitions of addiction or drug dependence relied in part on the consequences of protracted drug exposure as defining characteristics, contemporary definitions generally recognize that use of a psychoactive drug itself is the central element in the process of addiction (see review in ). For example, the recent report of the US Surgeon General on Nicotine Addiction used three primary criteria in defining addiction (): 1. Drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior is driven by strong, often irresistable urges and can persist despite a desire to quit or even repeated attempts to quit; 2. The drug has psychoactive or mood-altering effects in the brain; and 3. The drug is capable of functioning as a reinforcing agent that directly strengthens behavior leading to further drug-taking.",

Ecstasy has now reached the illegal drug market in Denmark via the US, Great Britain and Sweden. The drug is related to a certain youth culture from which it is estimated that many drug abusers have been recruited. The desired effects of ecstasy, namely enhanced openness, awareness and empathy, have previously been used in various therapeutic connections. In later years the drug has led to abuse which, in connection with certain cultural behaviour patterns (for example in discotheques), can cause dangerous psychiatric as well as somatic effects. The undesirable psychiatric effects range from fear through depression to actual psychoses, and the somatic effects vary from symptoms of increased sympathetic activity to malignant hyperthermia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and lethal hepatotoxicity. The last mentioned symptoms occur in connection with prolonged physical activities such as exhausting dancing sessions. The article discusses the available treatments for conditions of abuse and stresses the need for prophylactic efforts in the form of information and awareness of the problem.",

      "title": "The Clinically Meaningful Link Between Alcohol Use and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.",
      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood mental health disorder that can lead to alcohol and other drug (AOD)-related problems if it persists into adolescence and adulthood. Several findings suggest that ADHD contributes to the development of AOD use disorders. ADHD generally precedes alcohol use and is correlated with developmentally inappropriate levels of alcohol use or abuse; conduct problems typically precede the development of alcohol use or abuse. The potential role of ADHD in the development of AOD use problems has important implications for prevention and treatment of such problems. For example, people with ADHD have poor outcomes from AOD abuse treatment. Service providers who work in AGO abuse treatment settings must develop the diagnostic and clinical expertise to address co-occurring ADHD and AOD use disorders. KEY WORDS: attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity; alcohol and other drug dependence; alcoholic beverage; comorbidity; impulsive behavior; symptom; early AODU (alcohol and other drug use) onset, conduct disorder; diagnostic criteria; causal pathways; predictive factor; treatment outcome; correlation analysis; literature review ********** Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood mental health disorder that is characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It has been discussed in the psychiatric literature for approximately 100 years under various names, including minimal brain dysfunction; hyperkinetic reaction of childhood; attention deficit disorder; and, since 1987, ADHD. The various names reflect an evolving understanding of the disorder and an increasing consensus on its nature. One of the major recent advances in the research on ADHD is the recognition that most people who are diagnosed with it as children continue to suffer problems related to this disorder as adolescents and adults (Barkley 1998; Tucker 1999). This recognition that ADHD extends beyond puberty has expanded ADHD research into new areas, including the link between ADHD and alcohol use and abuse. To provide the appropriate background for understanding the link between ADHD and alcohol use, this article first summarizes the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. It then examines the hypothesis that ADHD is a causal factor in the development of problematic alcohol consumption. Finally, the article reviews some preliminary research suggesting that ADHD and its treatment may have important implications for the prevention and treatment of alcohol-related problems. DIAGNOSIS OF ADHD According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) (2000), the rate of ADHD in the general population of children in the United States is between 3 and 7 percent. Among children receiving treatment for psychiatric disorders in clinical settings, however, this rate often exceeds 50 percent (Barkley 1998), making ADHD one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders for children in the United States. The rare of ADHD in adults is thought to be somewhat lower than in children, probably between 2 and 5 percent in the general population (Barkley 1998). For adults in clinical settings, the rate of ADHD is currently unknown bur appears to be substantially elevated compared with the general population. Among adult patients receiving treatment for alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse, the rate of ADHD has been estimated to be approximately 25 percent (Wilens 1998). A similar rare of ADHD, about 30 percent, has been found among adolescents in treatment for AOD use disorders (AODD) (Molina et al. 2002). These relatively high rates indicate that it is important for service providers in AOD-abuse treatment settings to be able to diagnose and treat ADHD. The symptoms or problems associated with ADHD vary somewhat depending on the patient's developmental stage (Barkley 1998). Children with ADHD typically present with academic difficulties, discipline problems at school and at home, and conflicts with peers. …",

      "abstract": "210 patients with acute psychotic disorder in a state of alcohol withdrawal were examined. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

      "abstract": "this older aged population suffers from alcoholism.If prolonged, cognitive impairments in the elderly can lead to irreversible deficits that can have a dramatic impact on their quality of life.In order to prevent the adverse effects of alcohol dependence, it's imperative that elderly patients receive proper screening and treatment for substance abuse disorder [7].This paper will discuss commonly seen cognitive deficits caused by alcohol abuse and their various treatment options. Acute effects of Alcohol IntoxicationAlcohol intoxication can cause a broad spectrum of CNS acute and chronic manifestations.Acute alcohol intoxication presents with poor attention span, difficulties with abstract thinking, problem solving, anterograde amnesia, and reduces visuospatial abilities.These manifestations are often precipitated from temporary disruption of neurotransmitter activity within the brain.When used acute, these changes are mostly reversible.A few of the neurochemical systems altered during times of acute alcohol intoxication are the gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA), opiate, dopamine, and glutamine pathways.Changes in the GABA and glutamate pathways are associated with intoxication and sedation while dopamine and opiate pathways are responsible for pleasure and addiction [8].Once absorbed systemically, ethanol up-regulates dopaminergic neurons in an area of the brain known as the ventral tegmentum.Upon stimulation, these nerves release dopamine into the nucleus accumbens.This region of the brain is known as the \"reward center\" and is responsible for pleasure and addiction associated with alcohol use.Although alcohol stimulates dopamine directly, it is hypothesized that the neurotransmitter GABA is mainly responsible for the dopaminergic surge.GABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps regulate the release of dopamine.However, ethanol is unique in that it inhibits GABA release.This ultimately results in the disinhibition of neurons in the ventral tegmentum and aids in the dopaminergic surge seen during alcohol intoxication.In cases of chronic alcoholism, molecular modification occurs that results in an increased number of GABA channels to compensate for decreased activity due to continuous alcohol exposure.Once these chronic changes occur, withdrawal will be seen with decreased blood alcohol",

In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

(1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations.

      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals, regardless of their age, are subjected to a significant psychosocial stressor, two possible outcomes are likely—in one instance the person is not significantly affected by the stressor and proceeds on with their life without indication of perceptible problem. In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

In later life, it is often a conspicuous feature of systemic or cerebral disease and drug (notably anticholinergic) toxicity, and it may constitute a grave prognostic sign. Its development in a hospitalized patient may interfere with his or her management, disrupt ward routine, and cause medicolegal complications as a result of patient injury. Acute onset of a fluctuating level of awareness, accompanied by sleep-wake cycle disruption, lethargy or agitation, and nocturnal worsening of symptoms, are diagnostic. Early recognition of delirium and treatment of its underlying cause are essential. (<i>JAMA</i>1987;258:1789-1792)",

      "abstract": "Editor—Sanfilippo syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) encompasses a group of four lysosomal storage disorders resulting from a failure to break down the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate. Each of the four subtypes, A, B, C, and D, is caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme in the degradative pathway of heparan sulphate: heparan-N-sulphatase (EC 3.10.1.1), α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC3.2.1.50), acetyl-CoA N-acetyl transferase (EC 2.3.1.3), and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulphatase (EC 3.1.6.14), respectively.1 Clinical symptoms usually occur after two years of apparently normal development and include hyperactivity, aggressive behaviour, delayed development (particularly in speech), sleep disturbances, coarse hair, hirsutism, and diarrhoea. There are only relatively mild somatic manifestations. There then follows a period of progressive mental retardation with death usually between the second and third decade of life. In a small number of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, there is a more slowly progressive form of the disease with later onset known as the attenuated phenotype.2-4 A late onset phenotype has also been described for Sanfilippo syndrome type A.5 \n\nSanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme heparan-N-sulphatase (sulphamidase). The disease is autosomal recessive and the gene encoding the enzyme is situated on chromosome 17q25.3, contains eight exons, and encodes a protein of 502 amino acids.6 7 To date, 46 different mutations have been identified in Sanfilippo A patients,6 8-13 several of which have been found at high frequencies in particular populations. The R245H, R74C, 1091delC, and S66W were the most frequent mutations in the Dutch (56.7%),11 Polish (56%),8 Spanish (45.5%),13 and Italian (33%)12 populations, respectively.

      "abstract": "The quite diffused habit of a significant assumption of alcohol drinks, can interfere with the professional exposure to chemical substances. The interaction may result in increasing their toxicity and/or modifying the parameters of the biological monitoring. It may also act as a confounding factor, not only in epidemiologic researches but also at individual level when the assessment of the occupational exposure and/or the diagnosis of an occupational diseases, is under consideration. We review available references in the literature summarizing major scientific evidences.The interaction between the alcohol assumption and industrial chemicals may be toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic. Alcohol can interfere in the processes of biotransformation of xenobiotics and modify the doses and the effect indicators used for the biological monitoring, causing wrong interpretations of the results. The metabolism of ethanol can be altered by the exposures to toxic industrial materials, creating some clinical pictures of alcohol intolerance, like an \"antabuse syndrome\" or an \"degreaser flush syndrome\". Professional exposure to carbon sulfide or to dimethylformamides, trichloroethylene as well as to nitroglycerin and nitroglycole ethylenic can produce similar syndromes. Interactions are reported between alcohol and solvents: on toxicokinetic bases for methanol, isopropanol, glycol ether, trichloroethylene, methyl ethyl ketone and toluene; and on toxicodynamic bases for CNS. Also between alcohol and metals there can occur toxicokinetic interactions, like in the case of lead and mercury. Alcohol can also interfere with the biological monitoring of solvents, producing an over-estimation of the exposure.For the biological monitoring of reported chemical substances, it is suitable to evaluate the biologic indicators in the days in which there is not assumed alcohol. If this cannot be guaranteed, it is necessary to know at least the quantity of the alcohol consumed or at least if the subject is an alcohol abuser.",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "abstract": "Until recently alcoholism was regarded as being an incurable psychological problem. During the last decade a chain of research has led to a new insight into the causes and potential alleviation of alcohol craving: Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiate-like substances (endorphins and enkephalins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin, and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroiso-quinolines), can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the craving for alcohol is related to a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiate-like substances as well as other neurotransmitter substances. This deficiency can occur genetically or as a result of prolonged stress or long-term heavy drinking. The neurochemical imbalance may be treated chemically, leading to a possible alleviation of the craving for alcohol, especially in conjunction with psychotherapeutic and counseling regimens.",

Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten. Kod izrazito suicidalnih pacijenta može se dodati klozapin u vrlo niskoj dozi od 6, 25 mg u vecernjoj dozi. Pocetne doze i raspon doza antidepresiva u starijih osoba iznosi Vl- Vi doze za mlade odrasle osobe.

Sklona je dramaticnim demonstrativnim ispadima, somatizacijama i manipulativnom parasuicidalno'm ponasanju. Inace osjetljiva je na psihofarmake zbog vaskularnog parkinsonizma. Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

In addition to physical symptoms related to nervous system hyperexcitability, withdrawal includes changes in mental state that may motivate renewed AOD consumption. The manifestations of addiction are associated with changes in nerve cell function by which the brain attempts to adapt to a drug's presence. These functional changes modulate a person's initial response to a drug, the establishment of long-term craving for the drug (i.e., addiction), and the persistent sense of discomfort that leads to relapse after abstinence has been achieved. Research is beginning to reveal how specific brain regions may be integrated to form neural circuits that modulate aspects of addiction.",

Significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, i.e., an IQ of 70 or below on an individually administered IQ test. 2.

In some cases, the content of the psychosis could be partly traced to earlier factors in the patient's lives. The clouded states were compared to alcoholic pathological intoxication. Three had chronic psychoses resembling schizophrenia. One other was considerably deteriorated. The rest were unclassified. The neuropathological processes underlying these conditions are unknown.

It includes high-level cortical functions such as memory, language, perception, and executive function (planning, initiating, and reasoning) that generally depend on the alert state and focused attention. Dysfunction of cognition without a change in consciousness may result in various disorders, including aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, executive dysfunction, and memory disorders such as dementia and amnesia. Transient dysfunction of cognition associated with a change in level of consciousness or attention may be due to delirium or confusional states. This chapter broadly introduces the specific definitions of cognitive dysfunction and the overall differential diagnoses.",

No existe una causa simple, sino una interacción complicada de factores neuroquímicos, fisiológicos, psicológicos y sociales que originan y desarrollan esta grave enfermedad fármaco-dependiente. La acción psicofisiológica y farmacodinámica del alcohol es fundamentalmente depresiva, por la reducción de la transmisión sináptica en el sistema nervioso humano. Es un hecho conocido que el consumo excesivo de alcohol causa una disfunción aguda y crónica del cerebro, produciendo trastornos en el sistema nervioso central, presentando alteraciones en la memoria y en las funciones intelectuales como cálculo, comprensión y aprendizaje. A nivel hepático tiene lugar, en su mayoría, el metabolismo del alcohol, produciéndose un hígado graso alcohólico, aumentando el tamaño, terminando en necrosis e inflamación grave del hígado; esto se llama hepatitis alcohólica, y si se sigue consumiendo alcohol se desarrollará la cirrosis. El alcohol también ha estado relacionado con alteraciones del miocardio; se ha constatado en animales de experimentación sanos que tanto la velocidad de contracción del músculo cardiaco y su máxima tensión disminuyen en presencia del alcohol, como consecuencia, la fuerza de cada contracción y el aumento de presión en el ventrículo izquierdo son menores, perdiendo eficacia el corazón como bomba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"text-align: justify;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palabras clave: &lt;/strong&gt;alcoholismo, fisiología, neuroquímica, cirrosis, drogradicción, excitabilidad.&lt;/p&gt;",

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

De ahi, la consideracion del estres como negativo, cuando se experimenta excesiva cantidad, durante un periodo de tiempo demasiado largo y puede traer consecuencias conductuales (ausentismo, rotacion, accidentes, abuso de sustancias, consumo de cigarrillo o bebidas alcoholicas); cognitivos (toma de decisiones incorrectas, falta de concentracion, negligencia, Relaciones Interpersonales deficientes, etc.); fisiologicas (hipertension arterial, cardiopatias, etc.).Los Docentes Universitarios se ven sometidos a constantes exigencias en cuanto a tomar decisiones importantes, mantenerse actualizados en adelantos tecnologicos y del area especifica del conocimiento, introducir cambios efectivos e innovar; por consiguiente, el estres es inherente a su desempeno profesional, esta presente, en mayor o menor grado, en el desarrollo delas tareas ocupacionales, sumandole a todo esto las inadecuadas condiciones ambientales en las que deben impartir sus conocimientos lo cual viene a generar mayor nivel de estres. Tomando en cuenta la importancia de investigar sobre que factores son los que conllevan a que los docentes acumulen altos niveles de estres que afectan las diferentes areas de desarrollo del ser humano como lo es la laboral, familiar y social, se procedio a iniciar dicho trabajo con la recopilacion de informacion bibliografica para la estructuracion del marco teorico en el cual se mencionan las diferentes factores de riesgo en la labor docente, definiciones sobre el estres, las causas del estres, estresores en el ambito educativo, tipos de estres, psicologia y consecuencias del estres, la insatisfaccion laboral, estres y burnout, acoso laboral, etc. Posteriormente se detalla la metodologia a utilizar asi como los resultados obtenidos por medio de la investigacion, en la cual se aplicaron tres instrumentos como lo son la guia de entrevista, guia de observacion y la Escala ED-6, con el objetivo de identificar los principales factores que causan estres y como este afecta la salud fisica y emocional de los docente.

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

Stariji covjek može se smatrati toliko zdravim koliko za svoju svakodnevnicu ima dovoljno snage da se suprotstavi pojavama koje donosi starost, nedacama i svakodnevnim situacijama. Tjelesna istrosenost je relativna i ne ide usporedno sa smanjivanjem dusevnih snaga, a dusevne snage se trebaju pobuditi onda kad je potrebno svladati pojave koje donosi starenje, posebno negativan utjecaj bolesti i vanjskih faktora.\nZdravstveno stanje nije samo posljedica starosne dobi, ali svakako se starenjem povecava mogucnost da se ono narusi i sve brže mijenja. Najcesca stanja koja pogađaju stariju dobnu skupinu su povezana sa srcem i krvožilnim sustavom: hipertenzija i ateroskleroza, u gorim slucajevima infarkt; zatim, veliki je problem dijabetes, promjene u lokomotornom sustavu i sklonost padovima i frakturama. Nerijetko se događa da se uslijed nekih promjena na mozgu pojavi demencija ili druga stanja neuroloske ili psihijatrijske prirode.\nZbog svih navedenih razloga, te pomanjkanja mobilnosti i refleksa, smatra se da stariji vozaci predstavljaju određeni rizik u prometu. Nužan uvjet za ocuvanje sigurnosti na prometnicama su zdravstveni pregledi koji ce prevenirati da zdravstveno i psiholoski nesposoban vozac i dalje upravlja motornim vozilom i dovodi ostale sudionike u prometu u opasnost.\nKako bi utvrdili utjece li promjena zdravstvenog stanja uslijed starenja na vozacke sposobnosti, nasumicno je odabrano 25 ispitanika, vozaca starijih od 65 godina, to jest obrađeni su podaci iz medicinske dokumentacije nakon obavljenog zdravstvenog pregleda kod specijalista medicine rada u Domu zdravlja PGŽ. Rezultati pokazuju da su najcesca stanja i bolesti iz anamneze ispitanika hipertenzija (20%), bolesti krvožilja (14%,) i dijabetes (8%), a cak vise od polovice ispitanika je pretrpjelo frakture ili bilo hospitalizirano. 88% ispitanika je proglaseno ograniceno sposobnima, jedan ispitanik je proglasen sposobnim, a dvoje su proglaseni nesposobnima. Najcesce su Uvjerenja izdana na rok važenja od 2 ili 5 godina Nisu svi istraživaci složni oko odgovora na pitanje jesu li stariji vozaci rizicni, ali statistike za Hrvatsku prema podacima MUP-a govore da stariji vozaci uzrokuju 2/3 nesreca u kojima sudjeluju. Ako uzmemo u obzir da svi stariji vozaci koji su registrirani da posjeduju vozacku dozvolu ne voze, te da voze na znatno kracim relacijama, ovaj postotak je poražavajuci.\nIpak, nakon vise promjena zakona koji regulira kriterije za zdravstveni pregled vozaca , sada je na snazi zakon prema kojem je zdravstveni pregled obavezan samo ako je to navedeno u Uvjerenju dobivenom prije osposobljavanja vozaca. U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca.

What has been learned about the role of electrolytes in heart disease, and more recently in surgery, now sheds valuable light on this problem. In brief, every patient who undergoes major surgery experiences an electrolyte disturbance that may cause a psychotic or delirious reaction. Whether it does or not will depend on three factors: (1) the severity of the disturbance; (2) the treatment provided to control it, and (3) the presence of other factors which contribute to clouding of consciousness, such as sedation, hypoxia, fever, toxins, and circulatory collapse or impairment.

      "abstract": "There are many reports of cognitive dysfunction in patients receiving chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Many antineoplastic agents may be involved in the condition also known as \"chemo brain\" or \"chemo fog\". Two male patients (aged 41 and 70) with multiple myeloma developed severe, rapidly progressing cognitive impairment (mostly involving episodic memory) and loss of independence in activities of daily living during lenalidomide-based treatment. On withdrawal of the drug, one patient recovered normal cognitive function and independence in activities of daily living, whereas mild cognitive impairment persisted in the other patient. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score was 6 out of 13 for the first patient and 5 out of 13 for the second, suggesting a probable causal relationship between the adverse event and lenalidomide administration. Lenalidomide may induce particular cognitive disorders (notably episodic memory impairments) in some patients. The drug's putative neurotoxicity is probably promoted by specific risk factors (such as previous chemotherapy, prior mild cognitive impairment, age and the presence of cerebrovascular lesions).",

      "abstract": "A depressão é um dos principais problemas de saúde mental, caracterizada por sintomas como tristeza, desesperança, apatia, indiferença, desinteresse, além de sintomas físicos, como alterações no sono e no apetite. Essa doença pode afetar pessoas de todas as faixas etárias, porém, os idosos requerem uma atenção especial quando comparados às pessoas mais jovens, pelos riscos que os avanços da idade podem trazer. No Brasil, o número de idosos terá um aumento significativo até 2025, tal fato é preocupante, uma vez que pessoas idosas estão mais suscetíveis a algumas doenças, entre elas, a depressão. A depressão é vista como uma das doenças mais impactantes das últimas décadas, podendo levar ao suicídio. As causas se apresentam de forma variada e podem estar ligadas a fatores biológicos, psicológicos ou sociais. Alguns tipos de doenças, como câncer ou doenças infecciosas, abuso de álcool, perdas de pessoas próximas ou bens materiais, bem como o uso de alguns medicamentos também podem causar sintomas depressivos. O tratamento pode ser feito através de psicoterapia e de medicamentos, os quais passaram por um processo significativo de evolução no decorrer dos anos. Cabe ao farmacêutico, realizar o acompanhamento farmacoterapêutico dos pacientes, garantindo a sua segurança e orientando-os quanto ao uso correto dos medicamentos. No presente trabalho, objetivou-se analisar dados referentes à depressão em pessoas idosas, tendo como foco principal, os tipos de tratamentos disponíveis, assim como os riscos que um antidepressivo pode oferecer à saúde de um idoso. Para o desenvolvimento do estudo, foi feita uma pesquisa bibliográfica qualitativa e descritiva na literatura disponível, acerca dos pontos de maior relevância dentro do tema.

El síndrome de Ekbom se ha relacionado con múltiples causas, entre ellas el consumo de estimulantes y con la abstinencia al alcohol. El paciente tiene la convicción delirante monotemática de estar infectado por parásitos, lo cual puede acompañarse de otras manifestaciones como alteraciones sensoperceptivas. OBJETIVOS Analizar el papel de la cocaína en la aparición del síndrome de Ekbom. MATERIAL Y MÉTODO Descripción de un caso clínico y su revisión bibliográfica. Varón de 56 años, sin antecedentes en Salud Mental. Ex consumidor de cannabis y cocaína. Como antecedentes somáticos presenta infección por VHC curada y VIH. Recae en el consumo de cocaína tras fallecimiento de un familiar en Enero 2022, siendo derivado a la Unidad de Hospitalización en Junio 2022 por convicción delirante paranoide y actividad alucinatoria. En la exploración psicopatológica el paciente presenta delirios de infestación y zoopsias. En la exploración física observamos escoriaciones y cicatrices que se corresponden con rascado. Sin embargo, en el examen clínico no se encuentran alteraciones que justifiquen estas lesiones. Al ingreso comienza con Olanzapina 10mg desapareciendo la sintomatología en un par de días. CONCLUSIONES Es necesario hacer un correcto diagnóstico diferencial, mediante un examen clínico exhaustivo, el cual, en este caso, no pone de manifiesto ninguna patología física que justifique el cuadro, a pesar de lo cual el paciente presenta absoluta convicción. La idea delirante se ha relacionado con el aumento de los niveles de dopamina en los ganglios basales por el bloqueo del transportador de dopamina que producen los psicoestimulantes como la cocaína.

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis.

Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas. Kata Kunci : Cemas, Lansia, Hipertensi, Relaksasi Nafas Dalam ABSRACT Elderly (elderly) is part of the human development process. Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibiity seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleo-vestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

Rien n'indique à l'évidence que ces méthodes sont plus efficaces que les autres, non excitantes, pour traiter les alcooliques. L'échec de ces méthodes est parfois attribuable à des modes de conditionnement défectueux. Ainsi, (1) la difficulté qu'on éprouve à régler l'intervalle entre la présentation du stimulus conditionné (SC) (alcool) et la survenance du réflexe non conditionné (RNC) (nausée et vomissements). L'intervalle critique (de 0 à 5 secondes) entre le SC et le RNC est d'une extrême importance dans le conditionnement classique; (2) L'effet hypnotique souvent produit par les drogues productrices de nausées, qui peut rendre difficile le processus du conditionnement. Cependant, même lorsqu'un réflexe de répugnance à l'alcool est bien conditionné, il peut ne pas suffire à produire des modifications du comportement chez le buveur. Rien non plus ne vient prouver l'efficacité thérapeutique particulière du LSD.L'auteur met en lumière la difficulté d'évaluation de la plupart des études passées en revue et il expose les conditions minimales qui président à des études bien faites.

      "title": "Neurotensin and Alcohol Use Disorders: Towards a Pharmacological Treatment",
      "abstract": "Harmful alcohol use is responsible for a group of disorders collectively named alcohol use disorders (AUDs), according to the DSM-5 classification. The damage induced by alcohol depends on the amount, time, and consumption patterns (continuous and heavy episodic drinking). It affects individual global well-being and social and familial environments with variable impact. Alcohol addiction manifests with different degrees of organ and mental health detriment for the individual, exhibiting two main traits: compulsive drinking and negative emotional states occurring at withdrawal, frequently causing relapse episodes. Numerous individual and living conditions, including the concomitant use of other psychoactive substances, lie in the complexity of AUD. Ethanol and its metabolites directly impact the tissues and may cause local damage or alter the homeostasis of brain neurotransmission, immunity scaffolding, or cell repair biochemical pathways. Brain modulator and neurotransmitter-assembled neurocircuitries govern reward, reinforcement, social interaction, and consumption of alcohol behaviors in an intertwined manner. Experimental evidence supports the participation of neurotensin (NT) in preclinical models of alcohol addiction. For example, NT neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala projecting to the parabrachial nucleus strengthen alcohol consumption and preference. In addition, the levels of NT in the frontal cortex were found to be lower in rats bred to prefer alcohol to water in a free alcohol–water choice compared to wild-type animals. NT receptors 1 and 2 seem to be involved in alcohol consumption and alcohol effects in several models of knockout mice. This review aims to present an updated picture of the role of NT systems in alcohol addiction and the possible use of nonpeptide ligands modulating the activity of the NT system, applied to experimental animal models of harmful drinking behavior mimicking alcohol addiction leading to health ruin in humans.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

      "abstract": "Article AbstractWithdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Il est classique de dire que le deuil va entraîner des conséquences biopsychosociales. Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil. La prise en charge doit mettre le deuil au centre de la réflexion : – en traitant l’individu, en appréciant : ∘ la spécificité de son deuil : pré-deuil, deuil « blanc », deuil « non élaboré », deuil de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, de l’adulte, de la personne âgée voire très âgée, les circonstances de la mort du proche : mort d’un enfant, mort par suicide, par homicide, par accident survenant pendant un transport (voiture, train, bateau, etc.) après une catastrophe naturelle, si la mort est brutale et que la personne y a assisté ou si elle a failli elle-même mourir ; – en traitant le groupe : ∘ familial avec une approche transgénérationnelle, ∘ d’individus bénéficiant d’une prise en charge groupale : avec un même type d’endeuillés ou avec des endeuillés de causes différentes.",

Some behaviors, for some people, can have similar effects on the same DA reward circuitry resulting in very similar addictive behavior patterns and consequences. Although the term \"addictive\" has been used loosely with many behaviors, it may be an appropriate term to describe compulsive shopping. Increased accessibility, hyperstimulating marketing techniques, a loss of the protective delay between impulse and purchase, and overvaluing of the shopping process and objects purchased may all contribute to the potentially addictive nature of shopping.",

      "title": "Adverse reactions to drugs",
      "abstract": "Abstract An adverse effect is an unwanted effect of a drug. Adverse effects can be due to either toxic effects or side effects. A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

      "title": "NEUROPATI OPTIK TOKSIK AKIBAT ETAMBUTOL",
      "abstract": "Neuropati Optik Toksik (NOT) adalah kelainan pada fungsi penglihatan akibat kerusakan saraf optik yang disebabkan oleh zat beracun salah satunya adalah etambutol. Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from a heightening of the apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

      "abstract": "Sexuality in dementia is infrequently addressed. Dementia is characterized by a progressive deterioration in all domains of functioning, including loss of sexual function. However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang. Proses pelepasan metabolit spesifik ketamin akan merangsang terjadinya peningkatan pelepasan sinaps glutamat yang menyebabkan efek antidepresan. Hal tersebut menunjukkan bahwa ketamin dapat menjadi harapan baru untuk pasien dan peneliti dalam kasus depresi berat.\r\n \r\nKata Kunci: Antidepresan, Depresi Berat, Glutamat, Ketamin",

The same drugs can cause both psychomotor excitement or psychic slowness. In a few instances psychotic syndromes can be observed.

Se disena un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo que busca precisar sus caracteristicas. Material y metodo. Se registran los fenomenos clinicos en 61 pacientes consumidores de PBC, consultantes espontaneos de un centro tratamiento de adicciones en una comuna popular de Santiago, elegidos de modo aleatorio. Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia. Es una adiccion condicionada ya que la conducta compulsiva solo aparece como respuesta a estimulos externos (principalmente la posesion de dinero) o internos (cambios animicos o la fantasia de estar fumando). En un mismo individuo existen patones de consumo muy diferentes en un breve lapso de tiempo. Rapidamente se desarrolla sensibilizacion (hipertonia y estereotipias motoras, paranoia, ilusiones auditivas, visuales y cenestesicas, que son sintomas transitorios y vinculados al estado de intoxicacion aguda) y tolerancia (disminucion y desaparicion del efecto euforizante). La sensibilizacion y la tolerancia aparecen simultaneamente y en conjunto con la conducta compulsiva. Cada episodio de consumo por lo general termina con intensos sentimientos de culpa, ansiedad y aun ideas suicidas. Existen una frecuente perdida de normativas sociales y la constitucion de un sindrome psicopatico. Conclusiones. el consumo de PBC se cine a patrones de conducta muy variables pero siempre condicionadas a estimulos internos y externos, con poca o ninguna relacion con la euforia, sugiriendo un fenomeno asociado a la neurobiologia del aprendizaje",

El estudio incluyo historia clinica completa, examenes de laboratorio, interrogatorio sobre habitos y niveles de consumo, y consecuencias sociales del consumo de alcohol. Ademas, se diseno un cuestionario para la identificacion temprana de los bebedores que abusan del alcohol en forma excesiva. Se encontro que el consumo excesivo de alcohol esta asociado con numerosos signos y sintomas relacionados con el aparato cardiovascular, el digestivo y el sistema nervioso central, incluyendo la esfera mental. Asimismo, que estas manifestaciones producen, con cierta frecuencia, confusion en el medico y son atribuidas a otros procesos patologicos. La aplicacion del cuestionario, denominado AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), permitio establecer ciertos indicadores clinicos de las fases tempranas de consumo peligroso de alcohol; de ellos destacan: insomnio y/o ansiedad, temblor distal de miembros superiores, trastornos digestivos vagos, accidentes frecuentes, impuntualidad en el trabajo y/o ausentismo laboral, tension nerviosa sin causa aparente, elevacion de la gamaglutamil-transferasa, aumento del volumen globular medio, macrocitosis sin anemia y aumento de lipoproteinas de alta densidad. El analisis de estos resultados demostro que el AUDIT es un instrumento de tamizaje altamente sensible (80%) y especifico (89%), con un valor promedio predictivo positivo de 60% y un valor promedio predictivo negativo de 95%.

      "abstract": "Alcohol affects brain activity in various ways. It has both short-term and long-term effects. It causes slurred speech, short-term memory dysfunctions hallucinations, etc. by timing the activity of neuronal cells. Moreover, it causes teratogenic effects in the fetus ifthe mother is consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol can damage the brain cells, cause a lowering of serotonin levels, and higher GABA levels, cease new brain cells to be formed, and cause damage to the blood vessels and nerve cells in the brain. In addition, alcohol abuse causes WernickeKorsakoff’s syndrome, which is due to the lack of vitamin B1 in drinkers. Also, alcohol abuse causes Wernicke’s encephalopathy which is characterised by muscle problems, being confused, etc. Memory loss and less coordination are the long-term effects of alcohol abuse. All regions of the brain, such as the cerebellum, limbic system, and cerebral cortex, can be affected by alcohol abuse. The cerebellum is responsible for the movement of the body, and alcohol disrupts this balance causing emotional and memory issues. Alcohol consumption on a regular basis leads to reduced brain size or a rapid aging process. Alcohol disorder is listed as one of the most prevalent mental health problems in the world.",

      "title": "Postcardiotomy Delirium: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

      "title": "Cocaine Addiction as a Neurological Disorder: Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Clinical and preclinical studies provide convincing evidence for persistent neurological/psychiatric impairments and possible neuronal degeneration associated with chronic cocaine/stimulant abuse. These impairments include multifocal and global cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhages, infarctions, optic neuropathy, cerebral atrophy, cognitive impairments, and mood and movement disorders. These findings may encourage the placement of stimulant addiction into the category of organic brain disorders. Functional and microanatomical anomalies in the frontal and temporal cortex as well as other brain regions may be responsible for certain aspects of phenomenology and neuropsychopathology that are characteristic of stimulant polydrug addictions. These may include broad spectrum of deficits in cognition, motivation, and insight; behavioral disinhibition; attention deficits; emotional instability; impulsiveness; aggressiveness; depression; anhedonia; and persistent movement disorders. Although it is still debated whether the hypofrontality and other brain anomalies observed in stimulant abusers are a consequence or an antecedent of drug abuse, this debate seems purely academic and irrelevant with respect to the importance of compensating for these deficits in the development of treatment strategies. The neuropsychiatric impairments accompanying stimulant abuse may contribute to the very high rate of relapse in addicts that can take place after long periods (years) of abstinence. It is possible that the neurological deficits present in stimulant addicts, whether they are primary or secondary to stimulant abuse, are responsible for perpetual drug abuse which may be a form of self-medication (Weiss et al. 1991, 1992). In this context, addiction to stimulants, once fully developed, may represent a true biological dependency on drugs that temporarily compensate for existing neurological deficits. The concept of self-medication by drug addicts is supported by major theories of biological psychiatry. While a majority of drug addicts are polydrug users, there seems to be a preference for a particular type of drug among different populations of addicts. Addicts who experience distress, anxious dysphoria, and turbulent anger prefer the calming actions of opiates, whereas addicts with preceding attention deficit disorder, depression, or bipolar disorder often prefer stimulants (Khantzian 1985). Figure 1 presents conceptual relationships between brain damage and cocaine/stimulant abuse. More clinical studies are needed to establish unequivocally the epidemiological relationships between preexisting neurological deficits-resulting either from genetic, developmental, traumatic, or neurotoxic factors- and vulnerability to drug addictions. Nonetheless, deducing from the results of preclinical studies, it is conceivable that individuals with neurological deficits associated with attention deficit disorder, developmental neuroanatomical abnormalities, lead poisoning, alcoholism, posttraumatic brain lesions, and PTSD may be more vulnerable to stimulant addiction. This notion has significant empirical support as preclinical studies have shown that animals with lesioned prefrontal cortex became supersensitive to cocaine (Schenk et al. 1991) and animals with lesions at the amygdala, VTA, or raphe nuclei manifest more rapid acquisition of amphetamine self-administration than control rats (Deminiere et al. 1989). The above arguments, postulating neuropathology as an intrinsic component of stimulant addiction, should be taken into consideration with the caveat that the clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogenous and addicts may express varying stages and degrees of the disease as determined by environmental and genetic factors. Therefore, it is likely that stimulant addicts who have less advanced neuropathology may recover spontaneously after detoxification with proper nutritional and psychotherapeutic support if they can sustain abstinence.

Stress may also take the form of personal insult if dentists are regarded as incompetent when compared with their peers, or are seen as insensitive, inconsiderate and inferior to doctors. Attempting to stay on schedule in a busy dental practiceis a chronic source of stress. Not receiving commensurate payment for their services, anxiety about the future and long working hours may also act as stressors. Stress is not good for health! It is well known that stress and poor stress management increase susceptibility and vulnerability to ill health including cardiovascular disease, ulcers, colitis, hypertension, lower back pain, eye strain, maritaldis harmony, alcoholism, drug addiction, mental depression and even suicide. How does stress manifest in the practice? It may result in absenteeism, increased incident rate, inter-personal aggression, poor quality control, low productivity, high aggression, low productivity, high turnover, reduced morale, complaints and litigation.",

The result of this is reductionist planning leading to decisive therapy modifications.",

The psychiatric symptoms associated with cannabis use are agitation, insomnia, depressive or raised mood, anxiety, hallucinations, and concentration problems. It is known that cannabis use increases the risk for psychoses and bipolar disorders and may deteriorate the clinical presentation of pre-existing psychoses and bipolar disorders. A characteristic symptom of autoscopic psychosis is visual hallucination of some part or the entirety of a person’s body, imitating his or her behaviors and being perceived as if seen in a mirror. This is not a specific symptom of any mental disorder and the cause is not definitively known. In this case presentation, the symptoms of a patient diagnosed with cannabis use-associated autoscopic psychosis are discussed in the context of the literature.",

      "title": "Intoxication: Alcohol",
      "abstract": "Alcohol abuse and dependence are serious medical and economic problems in the Western countries. As a matter of fact, 86.4% of people aged 18 or older drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime; 26.9% of people aged 18 or older engaged in binge drinking in the past month; and 2% of people aged 18 had alcohol use disorder (AUD). The effects of alcohol on the central nervous system (CNS) are wide ranging. Direct toxicity of ethanol and its first metabolite acetaldehyde alters first basic physiological and neurochemical functions, which ultimately result in structural damage. Acute and chronic alcohol abuse, neurologic and psychiatric complications include ocular, motor, sensory, autonomic deficits, memory and cognitive defects (progressing to dementia), hallucinations, stupor, and coma. Generalized brain atrophy, atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis, and non-specific white matter lesions are detected on MR imaging. The following lesion patterns are encountered: acute and chronic alcohol abuse, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (WKS), cerebellar degeneration, central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), and Marchiafava–Bignami disease (MBD). In acute and chronic alcohol abuse, there is reduced volume of the white matter, frontal lobes, reduced brain weight and volume. Neuronal loss in various brain regions is evident especially in the frontal association cortex, diencephalon (especially in patients with Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome), and cerebellum including loss of Purkinje cells and cells of the molecular layer. Reactive astrogliosis is present. Sometimes Alzheimer type II astroglial cells with a large, round, lobulated or crescent-shaped vesicular nucleus (immunonegative for GFAP and positive for S100) might be seen. The Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) (acute or chronic form) is a neurological disorders associated with long-term and heavy alcohol abuse. Ocular alterations, autonomic changes, depression of consciousness, and ataxia (vestibular and/or cerebellar dysfunction) are encountered. Korsakoff amnestic syndrome is characterized by impairment of recent memory including verbal and non-verbal material. In chronic WKS, spongiform changes of the tissue, reactive astrogliosis, capillary endothelial hyperplasia, presence of lipid-laden macrophages, destruction of myelin and axons, and relative sparing of neurons are characteristic histologic findings affecting the walls of the third ventricle, mammillary bodies (atrophy in chronic cases), dorsomedial nuclei of the thalami, periaqueductal gray matter, and the floor of the fourth ventricle. WKS is a very complex, multifactorial disorder in which the interaction of multiple genes and environment play a role. It is also a complication of thiamine deficiency. Cerebellar degeneration, clinically characterized by cerebellar ataxia, slowly progressive ataxia of the trunk and lower extremities, and broad-based irregular gait, shows histologically degeneration of Purkinje cells, atrophy of the molecular layer and of the myelin core of the folia. A prominent layer of Bergmann astrocytes replaces the Purkinje cell layer. Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a demyelinating disease of the central portion of the base of the pons often associated with demyelination of other brain areas. Acute onset of para-quadriparesis, dysarthria, dysphagia, emotional lability, and locked-in syndrome may be present. CPM is caused by a too rapid correction of hyponatremia, whereby hyperosmotically induces the demyelination process. Marchiafava–Bignami disease (MBD) is an extremely rare, severe and usually fatal neurological disorder associated with chronic alcoholism showing edema of the corpus callosum (acute), and atrophy of the corpus callosum with necrotic foci (chronic). Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) includes a continuum of disorders that occur in children as a result of their mothers' consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. The most severe of these disorders is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). The cause-effect relationship cannot be determined. A list of gene-ethanol interactions might shed new light on this important disorder.",

The neurological disorders associated with alcoholism are of diverse nature. Clinically it is useful to divide them into three groups: (1) those due to acute intoxication, (2) those due to withdrawal from alcohol, and (3) those due to nutritional deficiency. Certain rare complications of alcoholism, such as degeneration of the cerebellum and the corpus callosum, are not included in this classification, since their relation to the toxic effects of alcohol or to nutritional deficiency has not yet been clarified. Acute intoxication from alcohol results in the familiar symptoms of drunkenness or, if severe in degree, in stupor and coma. In this disorder there appears to be a direct inhibitory effect of alcohol on the nerve cells. The second group comprises the tremulous, hallucinatory, epileptic, and delirious states. This",

The characteristic features of anticholinergic intoxication are the rapid onset of alterations in mood, cognition and perception in the presence of a clear sensorium and following the ingestion of the drug in a commonly distributable form. But if psychotic symptoms are present in the absence of retained reality testing a diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder may be warranted. Therefore, in same cases clinical picture presents a differential diagnostic dilemma.Method:The authors present the case report of twenty-one year old male with dependence of multiple drug use (according the criteria of ICD-X), who was observed in department of alcoholism. In early adolescence period he used different psychoactive substances (opioids and non-opioid psychoactive substances). At last two years he episodically consumed anticholinergics. Upon the mixed use of alcohol with anticholinergics he experienced auditory hallucinations, rapid and incoherent speech and paranoid ideation. He acted out his imperative hallucinations aggressively with violent behavior.During hospital treatment he was treated with antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines and supportive and educational therapies.Results:On this regiment psychotic symptoms resolved completely after two weeks.Conclusion:Results of complete psychiatric-psychological examination did not indicate psychotic disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand.

This paper focuses on the use of psychotropic agents which can be used at different stages in the alcoholic disease process. It does not cover specific drug therapies for alcoholism (aversion, chemical restraint, dissuasion), nor nonspecific drug therapies (vitamins, magnesium) the interest and limits of which are well known. All types of psychotropic drugs, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants, thymoregulators, neuroleptics, and beta-blockers are used, with two main indications: (a) to prevent or to treat the withdrawal syndrome and (b) to diminish the psychopathological factors related to alcoholism (anxiety or depression, for example), in order to avoid pathological recourse to alcohol. Recently, attempts have been made to decrease the craving for alcohol in humans after detoxification. Although psychotropic drugs are often used in the management of alcoholics, such management is not limited to them, but also includes psychotherapy and social measures.",

Among the syndromes dependence “drug-free” [1] we are: eating disorders, gambling, compulsive shopping, internet use, sexual hyperactivity, the problematic use of video games and other technologies. The gambling disorder is defined as a behavioral addiction, classified in the new diagnostic manual DSM-V under the new category “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” [2]. It was noted that many diagnostic criteria are common between the gambling disorder and substance abuse as: the continued exposure to the game/drugs despite the negative effects, the craving [3], the development of tolerance, withdrawal symptoms [4], repeated attempts to quit and relapse [5]. The gambling disorder is a psychiatric disorder emerging that has recently gained much attention because of its increasing prevalence and the consequences for personal, family and social relationships that cause devastating.

      "abstract": "this is a matter of isolated damage such as amnesia syndrome or if this is a case of diffuse damages that are characteristic of dementia.It is also important to differentiate confusing state from dementia.Confusing state is characterized by acute or sub-acute beginning, fluctuating course with consciousness disturbance, attention deficit, increased psychomotorics, common reversibility lasting for several days or weeks, whereas dementia has a slow start, progressive course without disturbance of consciousness and without distraction lasting a few months or years accompanied by irreversibility.Dementias are acquired, generalized and most frequently progressive disorders of cognitive functions that include intelligence, learning and memory, speech, problem solving, orientation, perception, attention, concentration, judgement and social abilities.Strong personality damages can also occur.They are diagnosed if impairment of cognitive functions disturbs work and social functioning of a person and shows a deterioration from the previous level of functioning.In diagnostics along with common neurological testing it is crucial to test cognitive status involving examination of memory, attention, speech functions, sensory and motor functions as well as integrative functions.Clinically, dementias are manifested by changes in cognition, fatigue, difficulties in planning and performing tasks, personality changes, behavioural changes.Demented patients are prone to detailed and extensive retelling, anger, sarcasm, pathetic expression of the face, aggression and emotional instability.The disease ultimately causes complete disability and such persons require adequate care.Dementia is not exclusively related to the geriatric age, but it may also occur earlier with diseases that alter brain function.Causes of dementia may be different.The so-called \"memo-VITAMINS test\" is applied and it indicates possible causes of dementia; these are vascular, infectious, toxic-metabolic, autoimmune, metastatic, androgenic, neurodegenerative and systemic causes.The most frequent is Alzheimer's dementia followed by a large group of dementias associated with parkinsonism involving dementia related to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewis relapses.[3] Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system; it is the most common type of dementia occurring in 5% of patients over the age of 50 and in 50% of patients over 80 years of age.It is also the most common cause of dementia in persons older than 65 years.The first and dominant disease symptom is a memory disorder along with disorders of speech function, praxies, gnostics and executive functions.The consequence is emergence of disturbances in three key areas of life: in daily life activities, behaviour and personality as well as cognitive functions. 1,2",

Examples of neurodevelopmental disorders in children include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, learning disabilities, intellectual disability (also known as mental retardation), conduct disorders, cerebral palsy, and impairments in vision and hearing. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders can experience difficulties with language and speech, motor skills, behavior, memory, learning, or other neurological functions. While the symptoms and behaviors of neurodevelopmental disabilities often change or evolve as a child grows older, some disabilities are permanent. Diagnosis and treatment of these disorders can be difficult; treatment often involves a combination of professional therapy, pharmaceuticals, and home-and school-based programs.",

This is partly due to impaired self-care, smoking, alcohol use, and an unhealthy diet, and partly due to the often long-term use of medication. Depression has a negative impact on concentration and motivation and increases anxiety and avoidant behavior. In addition, there are indications for an interaction between stress, psychopathology, neuro-inflammatory processes and somatic health. These (temporary) factors must be taken into consideration in dental care for persons suffering from depression. Also, one must be alert for interactions between psychiatric medications and medications used in dental care. Especially in chronic psychiatric disorders, a coordinated care between dentist, general practitioner, and psychiatrist is of importance.",

La exposición al estrés, particularmente al estrés de carácter social, actúa como una variable crítica tanto para el inicio como el mantenimiento o la recaída en el consumo de drogas. Actualmente existen numerosas evidencias científicas de la estrecha relación entre el estrés, el consumo de drogas y el desarrollo de neuroinflamación. Estudios con modelos animales han demostrado que el estrés social actúa como un potente modulador del sistema inmunológico, promoviendo la activación de la microglía y la liberación de citocinas proinflamatorias como IL-1β, IL-6 y TNF-α. Esta respuesta inflamatoria altera la homeostasis neuronal, afectando regiones clave implicadas en el sistema cerebral de recompensa y el control ejecutivo, como el núcleo accumbens, la amígdala y la corteza prefrontal. El estrés social es una variable crítica en el desarrollo del TUS. Es capaz de activar del sistema inmunológico provocando neuroinflamación y estableciendo un circuito patológico entre el sistema de recompensa y el córtex prefrontal. Intervenciones farmacológicas que modulen la respuesta inmunitaria cerebral ofrecen nuevas estrategias para prevenir o tratar la adicción, especialmente en individuos con alta vulnerabilidad al estrés. Sustancias naturales o sintéticas con poder antioxidante y antinflamatorio ofrecen prometedores resultados. Estos hallazgos preclínicos resaltan la importancia de la neuroinflamación y el estrés en la comprensión de la conducta adictiva.",

      "abstract": "Common psychiatric problems in cancer patients include depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and delirium. Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

It causes various health effects such as nausea, sweating, chills, muscle cramping, etc. The effect of this drug can be seen in 3 to 5 hours in the body. A spike in body temperature can be seen in MDMA users that can be fatal as it affects the liver, kidney, and heart leading to death. Addiction to MDMA is not yet proven, however, withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue and depression are noted. MDMA is usually taken via the mouth or snorting in the form of tablets or capsules. This drug is also taken or abused along with other drugs such as LSD, alcohol, and marijuana. MDMA is a scheduled drug with no proven medical use. MDMA causes a surge of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain to regulate mood, learning, memory, stress, anxiety, etc. This chapter discusses the effects of MDMA on the human brain.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

      "abstract": "초록·키워드 목차 오류제보하기 Muzong in Liao Dynasty suffered from borderline personality disorder due to various negative environmental factors during the growth process and after the emperor\"s ascension, and schizophrenia was more pronounced in his later years in office. Mokjong was so capricious that he got angry or brutally slaughtered the Valets (近侍). In addition, drinking too much and sleeping resulted in more days of not attending the meeting, and officials were appointed in a drunken state. As a result, the political situation became unstable due to the lack of administrative efficiency and the loss of national territory by passive response in foreign relations. He shows a psychopathic phenomenon called borderline personality disorder. A person with borderline personality disorder experiences a sense of confusion about himself, showing various protruding behaviors that are hard to predict because stable self-image has not been established. He was self-indulgent and self-indulgent, war, and sexual dysfunction, depending on alcohol, but he was more drunk and destroyed himself in a vicious cycle of shame and guilt caused by moral anxiety. Eventually, he is killed by people who serves close (近侍) who were subject to murder. As such, the impact of a human growth process on an individual is absolute. Abnormal behavior and mental disorder are the products of such painful and unhappy past experiences, as well as the causes that make life painful and unhappy. This could bring misfortune to society and the nation, not only to the parties but also to their families and people around them. In particular, it was inevitable that the absolute monarch of feudal society would fall in national power and endanger the country, as he was acting strangely due to psychological disorder, wrong decision-making, and disorderly conduct, so that his subjects could not control the monarch. #요 목종 #수왕 #근시 살해 #정신분석 #경계선성격장애 #遼 穆宗 #睡王 #近侍殺害 #情神分析 #境界線性格障礙 #Muzong emperor in Liao Dynasty #sleeping king #slaughter of Valets #psychoanalysis #borderline personality disorder Ⅰ. 머리말Ⅱ. 목종의 가계도 및 그 생애Ⅲ. 목종의 이상행동과 그 원인Ⅳ. 맺음말참고문헌Abstract",

In about 5 per cent of cases the alteration in mood may be accompanied by clouding of consciousness, delusions, hallucinations and disorientation. This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959).

Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose‐response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo‐graphic factors must be taken into account.

Addiction is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by compulsive drug seeking behaviour and consumption, loss of control in limiting consumption and drug dependence typified by withdrawal symptoms when access to the drug is denied. An overviewof the background and our current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin substance abuse and addiction is provided in this chapter. The findings from neurobiological studies suggest that the initial response to addictive substances activate both 'liking' (hedonic) and 'wanting' hotspots in the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum, provoking both the pleasurable effects and the desire to continue taking such agents. People who are dependent on alcohol will display withdrawal symptoms on abrupt cessation of drinking or significant reductions in intake. The withdrawal symptoms include nausea, emesis, tremor, tachycardia, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares and transitory hallucinations.",

O órgão alvo crítico é o cérebro, promovendo sinais e sintomas de encefalopatia mais ou menos acentuada, tais como, cefaléia, perda de memória, perda da concentração e atenção em tarefas corriqueiras, alterações de humor, com irritabilidade, depressão, insônia, ou sonolência, estupor, convulsões e coma, dependendo da dose e duração da exposição. O diagnóstico é confirmado pela dosagem de chumbo no sangue (plumbemia) ou na urina (plumbúria), ou de algum dos parâmetros de efeito do chumbo na cadeia de formação da hemoglobina, tais como o ácido deltaminolevulínico no sangue ou na urina e protoporfirina eritrocitária no sangue. O tratamento da intoxicação é feito com quelantes. Por questão de custos e disponibilidade comercial, a experiência acumulada no Brasil restringe-se ao uso do dimercaprol (BAL), do versenato de cálcio (EDTACaNa2) e da D-penicilamina. Entretanto, os quelantes mais eficazes são o EDTACaNa2 por via parenteral e o ácido dimercapto succínico (DMSA) por via oral. O BAL pode ser utilizado juntamente com o EDTACaNa2 em casos de adultos com sintomatologia encefalopática, ou em crianças mesmo sem sintomas de SNC, pois diferentemente do EDTACaNa2 ele passa a barreira encefálica quelando chumbo presente no cérebro ou impedindo que chumbo mobilizado durante o uso do EDTA aja no cérebro da criança.",

      "abstract": "Clinical experience of couple and sexological consultations indicates that some symptoms find in the heterosexual couple are the expression of a nevrotic solution of latent homosexual tendencies. This means that homosexual tendencies are repressed, or actualized through an imaginary elaboration or a symbolic one, by staying unconscious or manifesting through acting in a state of obnubilation. These different situations are illustrated by sexual dysfunctions (some forms of impotence and frigidity), hostile rejection and homosexual panic, jalousy, triolism and alcoholic aspects. This brief analysis is concluded by some reflexions from the clinical, social, couple and individual points of view.",

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Chronic alcoholism is associated with impaired cognitive functioning. Over 75% of autopsied chronic alcoholics have significant brain damage and over 50% of detoxified alcoholics display some degree of learning and memory impairment. In clinical practice, it could be difficult to differentiate between the various syndromes associated with chronic alcohol use. Objectives The authors present the various syndromes associated with cognitive impairment induced by chronic alcohol use. Methods Review of the most recent literature with the following key words: alcoholism, differential diagnosis, cognitive impairment and dementia. Results Chronic alcohol use can cause dementia such as chronic subdural hematoma after head injury, hepatocerebral degeneration by cirrhosis and nutritional deficiencies. The thiamine deficiency can originate Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. If not properly treated, it can develop as a chronic amnesic syndrome known as Korsakoff's syndrome. It is characterized by episodic memory deficit with confabulations, involvement of semantic memory, nistagmus and ataxic gait. The Machiafava- Bignami disease is rare and usually diagnosed in alcoholics. The symptoms include dementia, muscle stiffness, seizures, dysphagia and less often coma. Finally, diagnostic criteria for alcoholic dementia include dementia diagnosis made at least 60 days after the last exposure to alcohol; minimum of 35 standard doses for men and 28 for women per week for more than 5 years and, ethanol abuse mean within 3 years after the onset of cognitive decline. Conclusions Although various syndromes present similarities, the clinicians should be aware of the different symptoms as the treatment may vary according to the pathology.",

      "abstract": "An increase in the number of victims of psycho-violence, which has a traumatic effect on the personality, causing emotional stress, stress, discomfort, and depression, necessitates studying the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

      "title": "Tocotrienol and Cognitive Dysfunction Induced by Alcohol",
      "abstract": "Alcoholism, the chronic and excessive consumption of alcohol, is a syndrome characterized by severe peripheral as well as central nervous system toxicity. However, the neurobehavioral deficits induced by alcohol and their impact on quality of life of an individual, are often unrecognized. Over 17 million Americans, that is, 8.5 % of the population, meet the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse, more commonly referred to as chronic alcoholism [1]. Up to 50–75 % of long-term alcoholics may show permanent cognitive impairment, making chronic alcoholism the second leading cause of dementia behind Alzheimer's disease [2]. A significant number of alcoholics have clinically relevant cognitive deficits, even when the most severe alcohol-related dementias are excluded [3] (e.g., Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome or hepatic encephalopathy). Alcoholics consistently show deficits in executive function, declarative memory, and short-term memory and frequently show impairments in spatial learning and memory and impulsivity, effects which indicate hippocampal dysfunction [3, 4]. Parallel to the behavioral and cognitive impairments are observations of \"brain shrinkage\" or neurodegeneration in alcoholics [5, 6]. Human imaging studies, animal models, and postmortem analysis of brain structure support that chronic alcoholism is closely associated with brain damage or neurodegeneration. Alcoholics show significant volume loss in cortical and subcortical brain structures that includes both gray and white matter shrinkage. These widespread deficits occur in the absence of major nutritional deficiencies, although nutritional deficiencies can cause neurodegeneration and could contribute to alcoholic degeneration. Both postmortem and in vivo imaging studies of brain morphology reveal abnormally reduced brain volumes of gray and white matter across multiple regions. The frontal lobes are the most insulted region in the alcoholic brain with the superior frontal cortex showing significant neuronal loss [6, 7]. The frontal lobes regulate complex cognitive skills such as working memory, temporal ordering, discrimination, and reversal learning that underlie judgment, attention, risk taking, and motivation. Disorders in these behaviors are central if not causal to the consumption of dangerous amounts of alcohol despite the knowledge of negative consequences. Accordingly, chronic alcoholics demonstrate impaired judgment, blunted affect, poor insight, social withdrawal, reduced motivation, distractibility, attention, and impulse-control deficits [3, 4, 6]. Both clinical observations [3, 4] and animal studies have shown a direct relationship between chronic alcohol and learning and memory deficits [8–11].",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Abstract A common denominator in psychosomatically induced death is stress. Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between suicidality and substance abuse has long been recognized, although studies have only fairly recently begun to identify factors that may help clarify how alcohol or other drug abuse increases the susceptibility to suicidal behavior in vulnerable populations. In particular, alcohol and other psychoactive substance misuse has been linked with mood destabilization and the induction of manic or depressive episodes in affectively ill individuals, while also demarcating groups with heightened tendencies toward impulsivity, aggression, and sensitivity to interpersonal loss. Serotonergic mechanisms have been implicated in each of these clinical settings, along with possible dysregulation of other neurotransmitter systems. Psychosocial aspects of alcohol or drug abuse relevant to suicide may involve a heightened sensitivity to interpersonal loss, poor coping skills in response to adverse life events, and affective dysregulation induced by circadian and psychosocial stresses. Consequently, self-destructive behaviors with relatively little premeditation may arise during periods of increased stress, intoxication, depression, or other psychopathology. Early detection of substance abuse followed by appropriate pharmacologic and/or psychotherapeutic interventions may greatly help to minimize the formation of complex comorbid psychiatric conditions and reduce the potential for suicidal acts among high-risk populations.",

      "abstract": "Background: Drinking more than the recommended limits is a worldwide emerging problem, difficult to circumscribe, and alcohol-related brain damages are an under-recognized health problem. Alcohol-cognitive disruption can be considered as transient and recoverable if the alcohol consumption is limited and occasional; if not, it can progress to the so-called Alcohol-Related Dementia (ARD), or to the Wernicke encephalopathy, or it can even induce the Korsakoff syndrome, an irreversible and long-lasting medical condition. ARD still remains poorly diagnosed and addressed, despite having increased research interest being a frustrating condition, a relatively non-progressive, or even partially reversible condition in abstinent ex-drinkers. On the contrary, Wernicke encephalopathy, with its neurological symptoms (ocular coordination imbalance and gait ataxia), is a dramatic medical condition, potentially lethal which can lead towards Korsakoff dementia. The alcohol consumption is a strong reinforcing condition of the thiamine deficit, the main biochemical determinant factor that starts the cascade of the brain irreversible damaging events. Conclusion: Our review focuses on the possible common neural pathways of this three condition, on the biochemical basis of the damages, and tries to underline the strong need of better understanding the pathogenesis of the brain lesions, including epigenetics and the nutritional aspects of the problem. Keywords: Alcohol consumption, alcohol-related dementia, Wernicke encephalopathy, Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine, epigenetics.",

      "abstract": "La présentation est centrée sur une partie des troubles neuropsychologiques, les troubles cognitifs, qui sont une complication importante des consommations de produits psychoactifs. Ces troubles sont fréquents dans la maladie alcoolique : 60 à 80 % des malades immédiatement après sevrage. La nicotine pourrait être un produit stimulant de la concentration et de la mémoire de travail. Toutefois, le tabagisme chronique est clairement associé à une altération globale des fonctions cognitives et en particulier des fonctions exécutives et de la mémoire prospective. Concernant les drogues illégales, il existe un risque significativement augmenté d’altérations cognitives pour le cannabis, les psychostimulants (cocaïne et ecstasy), les hallucinogènes et l’héroïne. Le dépistage de ces troubles est important pour plusieurs raisons : – en raison de la grande fréquence des troubles qui sont souvent infra cliniques ; – les co-consommations de produits psychoactifs sont très fréquentes et il est probable qu’une association de toxiques se traduise par une altération cognitive plus profonde ; – des troubles cognitifs pourraient être un frein à la prise en charge addictologique puisqu’ils sont associés à une baisse de motivation pour le soin et à des difficultés pour intégrer les informations données pendant le soin ; – enfin, l’existence de troubles cognitifs pourrait être un facteur pronostique péjoratif (difficultés pour prendre les bonnes décisions et donc taux de rechutes augmentés). Le dépistage nécessite l’utilisation d’un test fiable, assez simple de réalisation et suffisamment sensible. Le Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) répond à ces critères et permet un premier screening. En fonction des résultats obtenus, des tests plus spécifiques, ainsi que des séances de réhabilitation adaptées peuvent être proposés. En dehors des atteintes les plus sévères, l’arrêt du toxique va permettre une amélioration des compétences cognitives qui va débuter dès les premières semaines et se poursuivre parfois pendant plusieurs mois.",

Addiction or dependence are terms used to describe persistent psychoactive drug use, but these terms also can be applied to other forms of repetitive behaviors. Many of these repetitive behaviors are regulated by specific regions of the brain that are influenced by drugs. Consequently, drug addiction may involve effects on systems that are involved in regulating forms of addiction that are necessary for the maintenance of life. Addictions also seem to be regulated by genetic factors. Because drug addiction may influence the activities of systems that evolved to regulate behaviors necessary to survive (ie, eating and drinking) and because individuals may differ in addict-ability for a given drug caused by genetic reasons, addiction should be considered as a disease and therapy should be developed with this concept in mind.",

Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

Elle peut persister jusqu’a 19 ans… Le NICE rappelle qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une « faute» et que les « punitions » n’ont aucun role therapeutique… Il faut donc d’abord informer les enfants et leurs familles et leur donner des conseils pratiques immediats pour limiter l’impact (protections et vetements de nuit adaptes). Une enuresie recente doit faire rechercher une infection urinaire ou un diabete ; apres quelques mois de possibles facteurs declenchants (maladie recente, trouble emotionnel…) qui peuvent necessiter une prise en charge specifique. L’evaluation est multifactorielle (symptomes de jour, autres problemes, notamment de constipation, troubles du developpement, du comportement, de l’attention ou de l’apprentissage, problemes familiaux…). Une evaluation en milieu specialise peut etre indispensable en cas d’incontinence diurne, d’antecedents d’infection urinaire, d’anomalies congenitales ou de troubles comportementaux majeurs, notamment en cas de suspicion de maltraitance. Le NICE recommande de ne pas restreindre les apports hydriques de la journee, ne pas reveiller l’enfant la nuit, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, de lui rappeler d’utiliser les toilettes a heures regulieres durant la journee. La place des differents traitements alarmes, desmopressine en premiere intention, recours a un avis specialise en cas d’echec avant utilisation d’anticholinergiques ou d’imipramine, est bien precisee.

This chapter presents the possible mental signs and symptoms, possible physical signs and symptoms, and clinical course and prognosis. It also describes the case of a 69-year-old patient who displayed the symptoms of chronic hepatic encephalopathy along with an unusual, delusional misidentification syndrome. When very mild hepatic encephalopathy is suspected, neuropsychological testing maybe extremely useful. Patients who are at risk for hepatic encephalopathy include: those with hepatitis (especially hepatitis C), individuals who have abused alcohol, have malignancies spread to the liver, toxic exposure, toxic drug reactions, or chronic liver disease of any other kind (Wilson's disease).",

Cognitive decline may also result from hypopituitary dysfunction, undermanaged post-concussive symptoms, other mental health symptoms and disorders, medical conditions, and a genetic predisposition to neurodegeneration. Cognitive decline may be static or progressive. Any individual who presents with cognitive decline following a history of concussion should undergo a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation, and this should be coupled with a detailed medical and neurological exam to assess for all possible causes of impaired cognition. Neurodegeneration should not be assumed as a result of prior brain injury.",

Typically, \nthese children are at risk for being a danger to themselves or others, and require a safe, \nfully-staffed setting to ensure the stabilization of dysfunction. Placement of children \nand adolescents in residential treatment occurs for a variety of reasons, ranging from \nsevere psychopathology or extreme behavior problems (including legal involvement) \nto significant family dysfunction that interferes with healthy and successful academic, \nsocial, and community functioning. Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders. They often present with symptoms of oppositional/defiant \nbehavior, anger outbursts, severe mood disturbance, anxiety, self-injurious behaviors, \nsubstance abuse, and poor social skills. It is widely accepted that placing children in the \nleast restrictive placement possible is the goal; however, a child’s referral for this level \nof care often results from the need for more intensive treatment than can be obtained \nthrough outpatient means.",

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\") is a unique drug, sharing properties of hallucinogens and stimulants. The acute effects of empathy, euphoria, and excitement for which it is used recreationally can make it overwhelmingly distracting for the user in the context of driving. This review considers the chemistry, synthesis, analysis, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and documented effects of MDMA on cognitive and psychomotor skills important to driving. Laboratory studies show that users do experience cognitive impairments, and may also act more impulsively while under the influence of the drug's sympathomimetic effects. Psychomotor impairment may occur with elevated doses or after repeated administration, and residual psychomotor impairment during the \"coming-down\" phase may be compounded by fatigue, dehydration, combined drug use, or other confounding factors. There is growing anecdotal information providing evidence of MDMA-impaired driving, and it is evident that many users recognize and attempt to mitigate the effects by delaying driving until the acute affects have dissipated. The drug inevitably may affect a subject's judgment and ability to properly assess their fitness to drive also. Blood concentrations in MDMA-impaired drivers suggest that this impairment can be caused by normal patterns of recreational use, and MDMA use should be considered inconsistent with safe driving immediately following ingestion, and for up to a day or longer following use.",

      "abstract": "Abuse of alcohol (ethanol) and abuse of an increasing number of drugs (e.g. analgesics and sedatives) are among the outstanding social and medical problems of many industrialized countries including Switzerland. Since alcohol consumption has profound effects on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of a variety of drugs, the rational use of drugs in alcoholics is an increasingly difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of the physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic and toxic actions of alcohol. Clinically the most important targets of alcohol action are the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), both of which are frequently involved in the mediation of potentially fatal interactions between drugs and alcohol. In practice the most important of these interactions include (a) inhibition of hepatic (cytochrome P450 dependent) drug oxidation by acute alcohol ingestion resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs that are predominantly excreted by hepatic metabolism, (b) inhibition of acetaldehydedehydrogenase by some drugs with production of an acute flushing reaction to alcohol, (c) increased sensitivity of the CNS to a variety of sedative drugs following acute alcohol ingestion leading to enhanced CNS toxicity of most psychoactive drugs, (d) stimulation of hepatic drug oxidation and decreased CNS sensitivity to sedatives after chronic alcohol abuse, thus explaining the \"metabolic\" and pharmacodynamic tolerance of these patients towards psychoactive agents, and (e) depressed drug metabolism and increased CNS sensitivity to sedative and hypnotic drugs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The mechanisms and practical consequences of the clinically most important influences of acute and chronic alcohol ingestion on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic actions of drugs are outlined.",

A diagnosis of dementia should not be made if the cognitive deficits occur exclusively during the course of a delirium (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).",

Nevertheless, this is the picture that can be produced by an increased serum viscosity.<sup>1,2</sup>The bleeding characteristically occurs from the nose, mouth, or gums but may stem from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Postoperative oozing is also common. Ocular symptoms range from partial to complete loss of vision due to retinal hemorrhages, venous changes, or even papilledema. The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen. The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

Depressed or anxious alcohol-dependent people often believe that they drink to relieve symptoms of sadness or nervousness. However, research does not unanimously support the prior existence of severe depressive or anxiety disorders as a usual cause of alcoholism. A review of recent literature (from family studies, prospective investigations, and studies of children of alcoholics) on the complex interaction between alcohol dependence and independent anxiety/depressive disorders reveals that if an association between alcoholism and anxiety/depressive disorders does exist, it likely operates in a relatively small subgroup of alcoholics at the same time. Psychological symptoms may carry a worse prognosis for alcohol-related problems, and these symptoms must be addressed early in alcoholism treatment.",

Brain damage: Damage to the brain, especially damage to areas responsible for balance control, such as the brain stem, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum, can cause imbalances. Nervous system problems: Nervous system problems can cause imbalances by causing problems in communicating with your body’s sensory information and motor functions. Medication side effects: Some medications can cause symptoms such as dizziness or unsteadiness as a side effect. Eye disorders: Visual disturbances, especially problems with coordination between the eyes or damage to the retina, can cause imbalances. Low blood pressure: Low blood pressure can also cause imbalance, especially when you get up suddenly or go to high altitudes.

CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia.

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

      "title": "Renal dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome: a potential contributor on developmental disabilities of offspring.",
      "abstract": "The term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) signifies the triad of intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly and short palpebral fissures, due to prenatal exposure to alcohol (1-4). Those severely affected have unusual facial dysmorphism with microcephaly, narrow forehead, short palpebral fissures with hypoplastic upper lip (5-7). In addition, they have developmental delay, behavior dysfunction or deficit, intellectual impairment and/or mental retardation (8,9). The term fetal alcohol effects (FAE) describe less extreme changes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Criteria have not yet been established for the diagnosis of FAE, but there is consensus that the diagnosis requires deficiencies in two of the above categories and a history of maternal alcohol abuse (1-4). \r\n\r\nPrenatal alcohol exposure has also been linked to cardiac anomalies, urinary and kidney anomalies, neural tube defects, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, gastrointestinal and genital abnormalities, dental anomalies, limb and joint abnormalities, scoliosis, ptosis, strabismus, epicanthal folds, microphthalmia, myopia, short up-turned nose, broad or low nasal bridge, low set ears and rotated ears (10-12). \r\n\r\nRenal structural anomalies of FAS include cross-fused ectopia, renal hypoplasia and urethropelvic junction obstruction have been reported in children with FAS (10,12). More recent clinical and experimental studies have also shown that fetuses exposed to ethanol perinatally have a number of renal functional abnormalities, including impairment in renal acidification and potassium excretion as well as a defect in urinary concentrating ability, even in the absence of any structural abnormalities (13-15). The scanning electron microscopy examinations of the rat kidney following fetal exposure to alcohol, showed mitochondrial swelling and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the epithelial cells of the distal nephron, suggesting the possibility of alcohol induced renal tubular cell injury (16). Assadi and Ziai also reported that offspring of alcoholic mothers particularly those children with FAS have lower plasma zinc levels and that the urinary excretion of zinc is increased in these infants, suggesting a direct relationship between urinary losses and lower plasma zinc levels (17). \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that approximately 5% of all congenital birth defects are attributable to prenatal alcohol exposure across the globe (18-20). Estimates for the incidence of full-blown FAS, is 8 for every 1,000 live births, while that for FAE range from 10-30 per 1,000 live births (18-20). It is estimated that 110,000 newborns annually are affected by alcohol. Cost estimates for FAS/FAE are exorbitant. It is also estimated that 12% of the annual cost for all institutional care for the mentally retarded patients, in the Western communities, are for individuals with FAS/FAE (21). \r\n\r\nDespite the wide spread incidence, FAS remains to be difficult to diagnose clinically, and difficult to research. The clinical features may not be readily obvious and individually are not specific to only FAS (6,9,22). The neonatal period is the most difficult to diagnose FAS. In the neonate the facial dysmorphic feature is subtle, often obscured by periorbital or general facial edema. Mental retardation and developmental impairment may not be evident for several years. Throughout gross specific clinical features can vary. No single feature is found in every case. Also, there exists some overlap between FAS and other syndromes. A history of alcohol abuse in pregnancy is often under reported or denied. Physicians tend to under diagnose FAS either due to lack of familiarity with the syndrome or a reluctance to place a label with negative social connotations. \r\n\r\nThe most distressing consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure is the central nervous system damage (7,8). The affected newborn may exhibit poor sucking, tremulousness, unusual body posturing, abnormal reflexes, and disturbed sleep patterns. The older infant demonstrates measurable decrements in mental and motor development, poor visual recognition, memory and decreased expressive and receptive language. Affected preschoolers demonstrate decreased IQ scores, attention deficits, delayed reaction time and decrements in fine and gross motor performance. The school aged child has decreased achievement scores, is easily distracted, learning disabled, shows poor organization and cooperation and has a rigid approach to problem-solving (7,8). Adolescents and adults with FAS have an average IQ of 65 with a range from 20 to 90. Those with FAE have an average IQ of 80, ranging from 40 to 100 (1-6). Despite higher IQ scores, individuals with FAE generally have achievement test scores similar to those with full FAS. In general, more physical manifestations are associated with poorer intelligence. However, there is a wide overlap in the ranges and the degree of brain damage is not always directly proportional to the severity of physical malformations, making it difficult to predict intelligence on an individual basis. Adolescents and adults exhibit a wide variety of behavioral problems, including impulsivity, social withdrawal and anxiety. Most have problems in adaptive living, lacking judgment and problem-solving skills. Few adults with FAS or FAE are self-sufficient. \r\n\r\nThe identification of renal dysfunction and zinc deficiency in FAS is important from a prognostic point of view and to permit adequate and comprehensive management of patients with this syndrome. \r\n\r\nPrevious studies have shown that birth defects that result from prenatal zinc deficiency are likely caused by a defect in DNA and protein synthesis (23-25). It is also known that zinc deficiency can lower the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in multiple organs of alcoholic patients (26). \r\n\r\nBecause zinc plays an important role in DNA synthesis and current data are inconclusive, it is possible that alcohol-induced zinc deficiency may contribute to alcohol related birth defects observed in FAS (17). This possibility remains a reasonable hypothesis and requires further study. \r\n\r\nAlcohol induced organ damage arises not only from the direct effects of alcohol on tissues but also from the metabolism and the metabolites of alcohol. Recent investigations have focused on assessing the direct effect of alcohol versus acetaldehyde toxicity, the role of nutrition with impaired placental function and synergic effects of nicotine and caffeine (26). More specifically, mechanisms for FAS involving altered protein synthesis and hypoxemia have been considered (26). Class I and Class II alcohol dehydrogenases are the enzymes that are primarily responsible for initial degradation of alcohol, acetaldehyde, in humans. It has been found that acetaldehyde can cross the human placenta from the maternal to the fetal compartments. Toxic aldehydes generated in this initial degradation step are further oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenases. It seems likely that genetic variation in alcohol metabolism may lead to differences in the propensity of individuals to develop alcohol induced organ damage. With DNA probes, it will now be possible to assess the role of alcohol metabolizing enzymes in the development of organ damage. \r\n\r\nAs to a specific mechanism by which alcohol may impair fetal growth and development, impaired protein synthesis, abnormal delivery or regulation of glucose in the fetus, altered zinc metabolism, and hypoxia are key considerations under investigation. Better understanding of the mechanism involved may permit more meaningful therapeutic intervention. \r\n\r\nThe timing of alcoholic exposure is also crucial (22). The most crucial period for anatomic abnormalities is early in the first trimester, which includes the time segment preceding pregnancy recognition. The third trimester appears to be the most vulnerable period for overall gross and central nervous system development. Intrauterine growth retardation cannot be detected by ultrasonography until approximately 27 weeks gestation. \r\n\r\nFAS/FAE is particularly tragic because it is totally preventable, simply through abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. It is the responsibility of health care professionals, social and government agencies to protect the unborn child from the devastating effects of alcohol. The most effective weapon for prevention of FAS is education which targets every non-pregnant of childbearing age (27,28). Pregnant women who are identified to use alcohol should be intensively counseled to discontinue further alcohol consumption. Although this will not reverse any damage already produced, at least any further damage is prevented. \r\n\r\nIdentification of women at risk is often difficult. Simple questioning can be unreliable because of poor recall or denial. Since direct questioning regarding alcohol can be intimidating, questionnaires may be developed for assessment of risk. Hopefully through continued educational efforts, we will successfully imprint the awareness that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is unacceptable.",

Cardiomyopathy develops in response to suddenly hearing stressful news, such as a loved one diagnosed with cancer. Thus, intense emotions, such as anger, can also lead to abnormal heart rhythms. When you are stressed, your blood pressure and heart rate both rise. Chronic stress causes your body to produce harmful quantities of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can alter blood clots. All of these factors can lead to a heart attack or a stroke. Negative thoughts, feelings, or emotions may influence lifestyle patterns, increasing the risk of heart disease. People who are chronically stressed, nervous, sad, or angry are more likely to consume excessive amounts of alcohol, smoke, overeat, and exercise insufficiently– all harmful habits that are detrimental to their heart health.",

An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine.

En dehors des etats confusionnels lies aux intoxications aigues ou au sevrage, l‘intoxication ethylique chronique est responsable de nombreux syndromes neuropsychiatriques : deficits cognitifs d‘intensite variable pouvant realiser un tableau dementiel, encephalopathie de Wernicke, syndrome de Korsakoff, maladie de Marchiafava‐Bignami et atrophie cerebelleuse. En depit des tres nombreux travaux qui lui ont ete consacres, l‘individualisation de la DA comme entite directement liee a la neurotoxicite de l‘alcool, demeure l‘objet de debats. Cet article passe en revue les donnees epidemiologiques, neuropathologiques, neurochimiques et cliniques concernant l‘association d‘une demence et de deficits cognitifs a une intoxication alcoolique chronique.

L‘intoxication alcoolique severe peut generer des deficits cognitifs plus ou moins importants, reversibles ou non avec l‘abstinence, mais aussi contribuer a la deterioration cognitive en rapport avec d‘autres pathologies comme la maladie d‘Alzheimer. La clinique de la DA realise un tableau de demence frontale ou sous‐corticale, domine par les modifications du comportement et les deficits des fonctions executives, tableau qui ne correspond pas a la definition actuelle de la demence selon le DSM‐IV. Pour eviter toute confusion dans la description clinique et toute reference a un mecanisme physiopathologique precis, il semblerait, par analogie avec la proposition de substituer au terme de demence vasculaire celui de deficit cognitif vasculaire ( vascular cognitive impairment), de remplacer le terme de demence alcoolique par celui, plus large et moins ambigu, de deficit cognitif alcoolique.

Children with ASD demonstrate early deviations from standard social development that persist across their lifespan.

The DSM-5 provides five additional specifiers that allow for the clustering of homogeneous subgroups.

The age-related weakness, cognitive decline, and criticism create favorable conditions for the formation of traumatic situations and is often accompanied by an increase in alcohol consumption, which in some cases leads to the formation of mental and physical dependence. Alcohol abuse leads to exacerbation of somatic disorders, the frequency of which increases with age. Alcoholism in the elderly leads to the accelerated development of organic mental disorders of varying severity. In turn, organic mental disorders lead to aggravation and complication of alcoholism. The formed comorbid disorder makes it difficult to diagnose and provide therapeutic and preventive measures.Коморбидные расстройства у лиц пожилого возраста являются наиболее распространенными. Наступающее с возрастом слабодушие, снижение когнитивных функций и критики создают благоприятные условия для формирования психотравмирующих ситуаций и нередко сопровождаются учащением употребления алкоголя, что в ряде случаев приводит к формированию психической и физической зависимости. Злоупотребление алкоголем приводит к обострению соматических расстройств, частота которых с возрастом увеличивается. Алкоголизм у лиц пожилого возраста приводит к ускоренному развитию органических психических расстройств различной степени выраженности. В свою очередь органические психические расстройства приводят к утяжелению и усложнению течения алкоголизма.

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

Such abnormalities, although reversible with sustained abstinence, seem to herald more permanent brain damage and possibly dementia in those who continue to drink heavily, especially if there is coexistent thiamine depletion. Together with the recent findings of the combined action of alcohol and thiamine deficiency on cortical viability in animal studies, this underscores the need to suspect and treat thiamine malnutrition even in apparently healthy alcoholics.

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoids are the most commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant medications worldwide. This article highlights the risk of clinically significant and sometimes severe psychological, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances that may be associated with glucocorticoid use, as well as ways to prevent and treat these disturbances. An illustrative case vignette is presented describing a patient’s experience of cycles of manic-like behavior and depression while on high-dosage prednisone, with long-term cognitive disorganization, vulnerability to stress, and personality changes. Severe neuropsychiatric consequences (including suicide, suicide attempt, psychosis, mania, depression, panic disorder, and delirium, confusion, or disorientation) have been reported to occur in 15.7 per 100 person-years at risk for all glucocorticoid courses, and 22.2 per 100 person-years at risk for first courses. The majority of patients experience less severe but distressing and possibly persistent changes in mood, cognition, memory, or behavior during glucocorticoid treatment or withdrawal. Although prediction of such effects is difficult, risks vary with age, gender, dosage, prior psychiatric history, and several biological markers. Key mechanisms thought to underlie these risk factors are briefly described. Recommendations are given for identifying individual risk factors and for monitoring and managing adverse neuropsychiatric effects of glucocorticoids.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. In recent years there has been a rising trend of anticholinergics use among high school students and it is especially common to mix alcohol with anticholinergics. The characteristic features of anticholinergic intoxication are the rapid onset of alterations in mood, cognition and perception in the presence of a clear sensorium and following the ingestion of the drug in a commonly distributable form. But if psychotic symptoms are present in the absence of retained reality testing a diagnosis of substance- induced psychotic disorder may be warranted. Therefore, in same cases clinical picture presents a differential diagnostic dilemma. Case Outline. The authors present the case report of twenty-one year old male with dependence of multiple drug use (according the criteria of ICD-X ) ,who was observed in the Detoxication Clinic. In early adolescence he used different psychoactive substances (opiate and nonopiate psychoactive substances). During the last two years he episodically consumed anticholinergics. Upon the mixed use of alcohol with anticholinergics he experienced auditory hallucinations, rapid and incoherent speech and paranoid ideation. He acted out his imperative hallucinations aggressively and violently. During hospital treatment he was treated with antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines and supportive and educational therapies. Conclusion. On this regiment psychotic symptoms resolved completely. Results of the complete psychiatricpsychological examination did not indicate psychotic disorder. .",

      "title": "Review of Delusional Jealousy and Its Association with Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Introduction Mental state changes can affect one’s sexual life, while sexual dysfunction can lead to relationship challenges. Delusional jealousy, also called Othello syndrome, involves a paranoid belief in a partner’s infidelity, leading to controlling and violent behaviors. It can manifest as a paranoid disorder, as a delusional symptom of psychiatric, neurological or other medical conditions, or as side effect of dopaminergic medication. Although its exact prevalence remains uncertain, it has been identified in 0.5-1.4% of psychiatry inpatients. Objectives To describe sexual dysfunctions associated with delusional jealousy and to explore strategies for addressing these dysfunction. Methods A non-systematic review of the literature available at PubMed was conducted using the keywords “Sexual Dysfunction” AND “Delusional Jealousy OR Othello Syndrome”. Results A number of factors, including sexual dysfunction, can trigger or exacerbate delusional jealousy. This is especially true for middle-aged men who have a history of alcohol consumption, neurological or personality disorders. Individuals with sexual dysfunction experience feelings of insecurity, projecting these concerns onto their partners and suspecting extramarital relationships. On the other hand, sexual dysfunctions such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Female Sexual Arousal and Orgasmic Disorders, Erectile Dysfunction and Ejaculation Disturbance may occur as consequence of Othello Syndrome. Multiple factors contribute to these dysfunctions, including increased testosterone and cortisol levels, chronic alcohol use, comorbid psychiatric conditions and antipsychotics. There are reports of increased sexual desire, especially in cases of dementia. Conclusions Although the evidence is limited and dated, it points to a bidirectional association between delusional jealousy and sexual dysfunction. Further studies are essential to determine the prevalence and types of sexual dysfunctions in Othello syndrome, and the causal relationship between them. Additionally, investigating gender differences is crucial, given the male-centric focus of existing studies. This research can contribute to clinical care by promoting the screening for sexual issues and their integration into delusional jealousy management. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Retrograde Amnesia – A Question of Disturbed Calcium Levels?",
      "abstract": "Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events or information. The successful acquisition and memory of information is required before retrograde amnesia may occur. Often, the trigger for retrograde amnesia is a traumatic event. Loss of memories may be caused in two ways: either by loss/erasure of the memory itself or by the inability to access the memory, which is still present. In general, memories and learning are associated with a positive connotation although the extinction of unpleasant experiences and memories of traumatic events may be highly welcome. In contrast to the many experimental models addressing learning deficits caused by anterograde amnesia, the incapability to acquire new information, retrograde amnesia could so far only be investigated sporadically in human patients and in a limited number of model systems. Apart from models and diseases in which neurodegeneration or dementia like Alzheimer’s disease result in loss of memory, retrograde amnesia can be elicited by various drugs of which alcohol is the most prominent one and exemplifies the non-specific effects and the variable duration. External or internal impacts like traumatic brain injury, stroke, or electroconvulsive treatments may similarly result in variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. In this review, I will discuss a new genetic approach to induce retrograde amnesia in a mouse model and raise the hypothesis that retrograde amnesia is caused by altered intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recently, we observed that neuronal loss of neuroplastin resulted in retrograde amnesia specifically for associative memories. Neuroplastin is tightly linked to the expression of the main Ca 2+ extruding pumps, the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Therefore, neuronal loss of neuroplastin may block the retrieval and storage of associative memories by interference with Ca 2+ signaling cascades. The possibility to elicit retrograde amnesia in a controlled manner allows to investigate the underlying mechanisms and may provide a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit processes of memory.",

      "title": "1. The Influence of Drugs upon Testimony",
      "abstract": "A wide range of drugs (medicines) are used currently, many of which are designed to affect brain function. Others do so as a side-effect. The effects depend on how the body deals with the drug (pharmacokinetics) and how the drug affects the body, including the brain (pharmacodynamics). An extensive range of effects on the brain and psychological functioning can ensue, including effects on intellectual functioning, dexterity, memory, learning and subjective effects. Individual factors are important and can profoundly influence both the type and extent of drug effects. Relevant drugs can be divided into: 1.

Those used to treat neurological disorders that have psychological side-effects. Examples are anticonvulsants and anti-parkinsonian drugs. 3.

      "abstract": "Besides cognitive changes, dementia disorders have other very important symptoms. Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

As repercussões cognitivas mais conhecidas do alcoolismo foram descritas por psiquiatras: a síndrome de Wernicke (SW), a amnésia de Korsakoff (AK), e a Demência Associada ao Alcoolismo (DAA). Métodos: Trata-se de uma revisão narrativa acerca dos aspectos cognitivos relacionados ao alcoolismo, com ênfase na DAA. Resultados: A SW é composta por uma tríade de oftalmoplegia, marcha atáxica e alterações no estado mental. A AK é uma síndrome residual após a SW, caracterizada por amnésia global, confabulações e alterações de comportamento. A DAA é uma síndrome orgânica com quadro de grave disfunção cognitiva, disfunção executiva, dificuldade no controle emocional e comprometimento da memória. Ainda atualmente há dúvidas quanto à etiopatogenia, status nosológico, prevalência e critérios diagnósticos para a DAA, devido à dificuldade de avaliação e a diversos fatores de confusão, portanto a compreensão atual dessa forma de demência permanece limitada. Conclusões: A DAA é uma forma de demência geralmente pré-senil e até certo ponto reversível, podendo ser classificada do ponto de vista neuroanatômico como córtico-subcortical e se manifestando clinicamente com sintomas amnésticos, frontais-disexecutivos, cerebelares e subcorticais. Até que tenhamos uma maior compreensão dos mecanismos fisiopatológicos da DAA, é altamente improvável que seja desenvolvido um conjunto único e reprodutível de critérios diagnósticos.",

      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

Presentación del caso: paciente con cuadro clínico que inicia a los 65 años, con disminución en la interacción social. Un par de meses después, la esposa nota que el lenguaje del paciente se torna poco fluido, habla con palabras o frases cortas, no logra decir oraciones completas, además de presentar cambios en la entonación de las palabras y alteraciones del lenguaje escrito. El paciente manifiesta que su principal limitación en el momento es el no poder expresar lo que quiere decir, y por este motivo consulta. Discusión: en el caso de este paciente, se describe inicialmente un cambio en su personalidad que no compromete su funcionalidad, sin embargo, al poco tiempo se presenta compromiso del lenguaje como síntoma prominente y que genera mayor compromiso en su calidad de vida, con pruebas neuropsicológicas y hallazgos de neuroimagen que apoyan el diagnóstico de afasia primaria progresiva (APP) variante no fluente o agramatical, con síntomas comportamentales y motores asociados. Conclusión: las APP son un grupo de trastornos neurocognitivos cuya característica primordial es el compromiso en el lenguaje, cada variante de APP tiene unas características clínicas y criterios diagnósticos específicos que se deben conocer para lograr sospechar el diagnóstico y hacer un abordaje apropiado en el paciente.",

      "abstract": "Emotional Intelligence in Female Children with PTSD After Sexual AbuseC hild abuse is a repeatable early life trauma that is dif- ficult to identify and is one of the strongest risk factors for later emotional psychopathology.Children and adolescents who have a history of childhood abuse have a low level of health-related quality of life, [1] and tend to be more prone to delinquency, posttraumatic stress disorder, and dissociation than those who have not. [2]Also, types of abuse are related to specific psychiatric comorbidity.Sexual abuse is more associated with posttraumatic stress disorder than other kinds of abuse. [3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

Patients who are intoxicated are more likely to be injured in traumatic accidents, and there is a significant association between having a SUD and injury from physical trauma. Risk-taking behavior associated with drug use can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and other infections, including those acquired through injection drug use (e.g., cellulitis, endocarditis, HIV, hepatitis C virus [HCV]). SUDs are more prevalent in patients who have depression or anxiety disorders or other psychiatric comorbidities (including personality disorders) and in those who use tobacco or alcohol. Patients with a dual diagnosis (i.e., both SUD and another major psychiatric disorder) may present with complex clinical histories and symptoms that make diagnosis challenging. Intoxication and withdrawal symptoms may be mistaken for other psychiatric or medical symptoms. Hospitalization may be prolonged by delirium due to intoxication or withdrawal.",

Abuse of a medication refers to excessive use of a drug to achieve a “high,” which may result in addiction to the medication and which causes dysfunction in a patient's life. However, misuse refers to usage of a medication without a prescription or for reasons other than that which it was prescribed. Diversion refers to the diverting of legally prescribed medication into illegal use by other than the patient. Sahakian and Morein-Zamir recently discussed the use of cognitive-enhancing drugs by individuals with a variety of disorders as well as off-label and non-prescription use by the general public. In addition to inappropriate use of medications, patients with ADHD often turn to other substances that are detrimental to their health, such as nicotine.",

The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of psychiatric disorder is well established for the non‐learning‐disabled population. In clinical practice, medication seems to be broadly as effective for people with learning disabilities. The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of challenging behaviours is less well established, although evidence for effectiveness is accumulating for some types of problem behaviour. When treating behavioural problems, medication is often used in combination with other management strategies. Knowledge of side effects is important, because people who have difficulty communicating may not be able to Report problems before they become severe. When using medication, it is important to try to achieve the best benefit: risk ratio, taking into account the person's other health problems and disabilities. It may be necessary to measure treatment effects, using standardised assessments or individual measures of target symptoms or behaviours.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

However, taking the overall clinical course into consideration, withdrawal syndrome could have been affected by some factors.

      "title": "[Mechanism of nicotine dependence].",
      "abstract": "This article reviews the current studies on the mechanism of nicotine dependence. In the process of nicotine dependence, there are four major determinants: reinforcing effects, tolerance, craving and withdrawal. 1) The positive reinforcing effects of nicotine are important especially for the initiation of nicotine self-administration. These effects are considered to be induced by the ability of nicotine to promote the release of catecholamines, acetylcholine, beta-endorphine, glucocorticoid, and other kinds of hormones. 2) However, tolerance gradually develops to the positive reinforcing effects of nicotine, as nicotine is repeatedly self-administered. 3) Craving is defined as the uncontrollability of the urge to take drugs, which is a core aspect of recent ICD-10 or DSM-IV descriptions. Craving for nicotine is caused and enhanced by the following three factors; psychic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, depression and dysphoria, conditioning processes leading to the association of nicotine effects with environmental stimuli, and memory of the reinforcing effects of nicotine. 4) Neither somatic withdrawal symptoms nor mental disorders related to nicotine dependence is significant. 5) As for the neurobiology of nicotine dependence, the reward system is focused as a putative responsible region involved not only in the reinforcing effects of nicotine but also in the psychic withdrawal symptoms. The amygdala-nucleus accumbens connection may be intimately involved in the association between nicotine effects and environmental stimuli. And neuronal circuits involved in memory function may be implicated in the manifestation of craving and relapse, but the details remain to be solved.",

      "abstract": "Les intoxications aiguës ou chroniques, par des agents pharmacologiques, des substances illicites ou des agents de notre environnement, peuvent entraîner des manifestations convulsives dont l'incidence est difficile à établir. Les propriétés intrinsèques des molécules peuvent expliquer certaines manifestations. Il semble, parmi les médicaments, que l'incidence des convulsions induites par les antidépresseurs tricycliques était particulièrement importante. Parmi les substances illicites, l'utilisation accrue des psychostimulants, principalement de la cocaïne, s'accompagne également fréquemment de convulsions. Les crises convulsives induites par des toxiques sont souvent uniques et de courte durée, cédant parfois avant tout traitement. Elles peuvent cependant évoluer vers un état de mal épileptique. Si les mécanismes physiopathologiques sont similaires à ceux décrits dans l'épilepsie au sens large, il existe cependant quelques mécanismes de toxicité plus spécifique dont la connaissance peut avoir une implication thérapeutique. De même, des facteurs extraneurologiques peuvent aggraver la situation. De nombreuses complications des crises convulsives peuvent être décrites, notamment cardiocirculatoires. Acute or chronic poisoning by drugs, illicit substances, environmental agents can cause seizures with a variable incidence. Seizures may be explained by the intrinsic properties of the drug or toxic agent. Among drugs, the incidence of tricyclic antidepressants induced seizures was particularly high. The increasing use of psychostimulants, like cocaine, is also responsible for frequent seizures. Drug induced seizures are usually brief, single, generalized tonic–clonic and self-limiting. They can even stop before any drug administration. However, they may evolve in some instances to status epilepticus. The mechanisms involved in drug induced seizures are rather similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. Yet, more specific mechanisms are also encountered and they will modify the therapeutic decisions. Also, extraneurological disorders could worsen the clinical condition. Several complications are described, including cardiocirculatory failure.",

      "abstract": "【背景と目的】高齢者は，内服薬の種類が多いことや自己管理が困難になることがあり，定期処方の薬剤でも薬物中毒を引き起こし得る。今回，高齢者の急性薬物中毒の傾向について検討した。【対象と方法】2009年1月1日から2013年12月31日までの過去5年間に，当院救急外来で急性薬物中毒と診断した65歳以上の症例を対象とした。薬物依存症，診断が疑いの場合は，対象から除外した。自殺目的や誤ってなどで自ら過量服薬した故意的要素か，偶発的な事故的要素か，原因薬剤，主訴，転帰などを調査した。【結果】65歳以上の急性薬物中毒の総数は72例。84歳以下では故意による過量服薬が多かったが，超高齢者では定期内服による事故要素が多かった。原因薬物は，ベンゾジアゼピン系睡眠薬42例，フェノバルビタール8例，ジギタリス製剤8例，フェニトイン4例，カルシウム拮抗薬もしくはβ遮断薬4例，テオフィリン2例，抗うつ薬2例，サリチル酸1例，アシクロビル1例であった。主訴は意識障害が35例と最も多く，ショックを伴っていたのは8例で，家族や施設職員などにより発見されていた。【結語】高齢であるほど故意による薬物中毒は少なく，定期内服による中毒が多かった。高齢者では腎機能障害を有している例が多いと考えられ，抗てんかん薬，ジギタリスを含む抗不整脈薬，降圧薬の作用増強・遷延が起こりやすい。 Background: In elderly people, drug intoxication in regular prescription setting, can be caused by too many kinds of oral medicines and with the difficulty in self–administration. We researched on the tendency of acute drug intoxication in elderly people. Methods: Patient over 65 years old who have been diagnosed acute drug intoxication at emergency department in our hospital last 5 years from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2013 were included. We investigated on the cause, either intentional factors like suicide and overdose medication or contingent accident factors, offending drugs, chief complaint, living conditions and outcomes. Those who had suspected diagnosis or drug dependence case were excluded. Results: There were 72 cases of acute drug intoxication. In patients under 84 years old mostly overdosed intentionally, but on the other hand, in patients 85 years old or more had more accidental factor by taking drugs regularly. The offending drugs were benzodiazepine 42 cases, phenobarbital 8 cases, digitalis 8 cases, phenytoin 4 cases, calcium antagonist 4 cases, theophylline 2 cases, antidepressant 2 cases, salicylated 1 case, and acyclovir 1 case. The chief complaints were impaired consciousness in 35 cases which were the most, and 8 cases were in shock, which were found by family or facility workers. Conclusions: The higher the age is, the fewer intentional drug intoxication, and we have to consider there are many cases that have renal dysfunction in the elderly. 高齢者は，基礎疾患の多様性により多種類の併用薬剤や複数の医療機関受診による整理困難な内服処方を受けている場合が多い。その結果，定期処方であっても，自己管理が困難であることや，薬物代謝の加齢変化などが誘因となり，薬物有害事象が発生する。外来患者や介護施設でも高齢者の10%以上に薬物有害事象が見られ 1，高齢者入院の1.5%がこのような薬物有害事象による入院と報告 2されている。そこで，救急外来における高齢者の急性薬物中毒の傾向を調査し，高齢者診療における注意点を考察した。 また，本研究のヒトを対象とした研究にあたっては，Helsinki人権宣言に基づく倫理規定を遵守した。 対象は2009年1月1日から2013年12月31日までの過去5年間に，当院救急外来を受診し急性薬物中毒と診断された65歳以上の症例である。血糖降下薬，抗血小板薬，抗凝固薬が関連したと思われる症例，薬物依存症，中毒診断が疑いの場合，また毒劇物，農薬，アルコールなど医薬品以外の中毒は対象から除外した。カルテ記載を調査した後ろ向き研究であり，年齢階級別に65歳から74歳までの前期高齢者，75歳から84歳までの後期高齢者，85歳以上の超高齢者に分けて調査した。調査項目は，故意か事故か，主訴，生活背景（日常生活動作，居住環境），原因薬剤，転帰，腎機能とした。故意か事故かの判断については，正しい量を内服しているにもかかわらず，血中濃度が中毒域になり臨床症状が出現しているものを事故とし，それ以外の自殺企図目的やより効果を求めて過量服用したものは故意と区別した。また，認知機能低下などによる誤服用については正しい服用方法ではないため，今回の検討では故意に分類した。また，腎機能の指標となる糸球体濾過量（glomerular filtration rate: GFR）は，日本腎臓病学会（2008年）で報告されたものに基づいて，男性の場合はeGFR（mL/分/1.73m2）=194×Cr−1.094×年齢−0.287，女性の場合はeGFR（mL/分/1.73m2）=194×Cr−1.094×年齢−0.287×0.739で算出した。 統計はJMP®11.2.0を使用し，年齢階級別の解析はカイ2乗検定，one–way ANOVAで行い，有意水準は0.05未満とした。 過去5年間の65歳以上の急性薬物中毒の総数は72例，そのうち前期高齢者は31例，後期高齢者は30例，超高齢者は11例であった。主な調査項目の結果をTable 1に示す。年齢中央値は77.0歳，最少年齢65歳，最高年齢95歳，男性28例，女子44例であった。救急車による緊急搬送は50例（69.4%）で，85歳以上では11例全例が救急搬送であり，年齢群別で有意差を認めた（p<0.05）。自殺目的や誤ってなどで自ら過量服薬した故意的要素の症例は40例，偶発的な事故症例は32例であった。前期高齢者では，故意的症例が74.2%と多かったが，超高齢者では事故的症例が72.7%と，高齢になればなるほど事故的要素が有意に増加していた（p<0.05）。

生活背景としては，まず日常生活動作が自立している人は55例，杖歩行や車いす使用が12例，部分介助や寝たきりは5例であった。主に薬剤管理している者は，本人が65例，家族4例，誰が管理しているか不明であったものは4例と，患者自身で内服管理している症例が90.3%と多かった。居住状況は，独居22例，家族と同居44例，施設入居2例，不明4例と家族と同居している症例が61%と最も多かったが，独居も約30.6%を占めていた。定期内服種類数は，前期高齢者4.0種類，後期高齢者5.0種類，超高齢者7.5種類と，高齢になるほど有意に定期内服薬の種類数が多かった（p<0.05）。 主訴は，意識障害35例，脱力11例，ショック8例，傾眠7例，倦怠感7例，心停止，嘔気，食欲低下，焦燥感，特にないというのが各1例と，非特異的な症状であった。 中毒の原因となった薬剤は，ベンゾジアゼピン系などの睡眠薬42例，フェノバルビタール系薬剤8例，ジギタリス製剤8例，フェニトイン4例，カルシウム拮抗薬やβ遮断薬が4例，三環系抗うつ薬2例，テオフィリン2例，サリチル酸1例，抗ウイルス薬1例であった。 治療は，経過観察および薬剤中止のみによる自然軽快が64例，ベンゾジアゼピン中毒に対する拮抗薬物の使用3例，アシクロビル中毒やテオフィリン中毒に対する血液透析2例，ジギタリス中毒に対する一時的ペースメーカー留置2例，三環系抗うつ薬中毒に対する心肺蘇生法1例であった。転帰は，入院44例，帰宅28例であり，入院日数の中央値は前期高齢者で3.0日，後期高齢者で4.0日，超高齢者で4.5日であった（p=0.71）。 次に，事故的要素で薬物中毒となった32例の特徴をTable 2に示す。全体での結果と同様に，高齢になるほど定期内服薬の種類数が多いことに有意差を認めたが，それ以外の項目では有意差を認めなかった。生活背景では，日常生活動作が自立している人は20例（62.5%）と多く，主に薬剤管理しているのが本人である症例は28例（87.5%）であった。居住状況は，独居7例，家族と同居22例，施設入居1例，不明2例と家族と同居している症例が最も多かった。事故的症例の独居者の主訴は，本人が嘔気や傾眠を自覚し救急搬送しているものが5例，ヘルパーなどの介護者に倒れているのを発見された意識障害症例は2例であった。中毒の原因となった薬剤は，ベンゾジアゼピン系などの睡眠薬9例，フェノバルビタール系薬剤2例，ジギタリス製剤8例，フェニトイン4例，カルシウム拮抗薬やβ遮断薬が4例，三環系抗うつ薬1例，テオフィリン2例，サリチル酸1例，抗ウイルス薬1例であり，基礎疾患関連の循環器系薬剤の影響が多かった。また，相互作用を起こす内服薬は27例処方されており，その相互作用が今回の主訴と関連した症例は17例であった。2週間前に抗てんかん薬が新規追加された症例，向精神薬やカルシウム拮抗薬が数日前から増量された症例，定期内服が頻回に変更されている症例，各専門診療科受診で非ステロイド性抗炎症薬などが新規追加された症例を認めた。

3。本邦の調査でも，一般病院の入院症例では60歳未満に比べて70歳以上では1.5倍以上の薬物有害事象出現率を示し，高齢者の6～15%に薬物有害事象を認めたとされている 4, 5。その原因として，高齢者においては基礎疾患および年齢に伴う薬物代謝の変化を背景とした“薬の効き過ぎ”と多剤併用（polypharmacy）が重要と認識され，老年病専門医においては，93%で薬物有害事象の予防目的に薬剤を減量・中止することがあると報告 6されている。本検討でも，高齢者の薬物中毒は少なからず認められ，高齢になるほど故意での過量服用より事故要素の薬物中毒が多かった。これは決められた量の処方薬を飲んでいるだけにもかかわらず，血中濃度が高値になってしまう場合であり，今回この事故的要素の薬物中毒に焦点をあて，誘因を調査し，薬物側因子と患者側因子に分けた。まず薬物側因子では高齢になるほど定期内服薬の種類および数が多くなること，基礎疾患に対する処方薬が増えるため定期内服薬自体に相互作用を起こすものが多くなること，新たな疾患に対して各専門診療科でそれぞれ新規薬剤が追加されること，有効血中濃度域と中毒域が比較的狭い薬剤の使用が多いことが挙げられる。患者側因子は，年齢とともに徐々に肝機能や心機能，腎機能が低下してくること，発熱や経口摂取不良により脱水になりやすいこと，骨密度低下による筋骨格系の受診歴が増加し非ステロイド性抗炎症剤などの鎮痛剤使用があること，これらの相互的作用によりさらなる腎機能障害が出現することである。また，薬物側因子と患者側因子が重複した場合，決められた量や種類を誤って服用したりすることで，少量の薬剤でも重篤な症状となり得る。 高齢者の薬剤有害事象を未然に防ぐ処方基準として欧米ではBeers criteria 7, 8が広く知られている。65歳以上の高齢患者を対象として，「高齢患者において疾患・病態によらず一般に使用を避けることが望ましい薬剤」と「高齢患者における特定の疾患・病態において使用を避けることが望ましい薬剤」が載っており，その日本版 9も呈示されている。しかしながら，Beers criteriaに挙げられている一般不適切薬よりも，ワーファリン，インスリンといった薬のほうが，有害事象による救急医療を要する割合が約35倍にも上るという報告 10もあり，その問題点が指摘されている。我が国における薬物有害事象を未然に防ぐ取り組みとしては，医薬分業制度があり，薬剤師が介入することにより患者の服薬管理が整えば，複数の医療機関からの重複投薬をチェックでき，副作用の防止につながる。この制度は2003年に初めて全国の医薬分業率（外来で処方箋を受け取った患者のうち，院外の薬局で調剤を受けた割合）が50%を超えており，今後もさらなる拡大が望まれる。また本検討では，原因薬剤は睡眠薬系が最も多かったが，循環器系や抗てんかん薬など基礎疾患関連の薬剤，特に事故症例に限定すると循環器系薬剤の影響が多く，より重篤な症状を呈し治療介入を要していた。このような重篤な有害事象が起こっていることを，日々病診連携で情報提供しあうことが大切である。 その他の結果として，若年者より総数は少ないが，自殺目的による薬物過量服用は高齢者でも散見されること，認知機能の低下により内服薬の種類や量を誤って服用してしまう症例があった。 救急臨床現場では，本人からの情報聴取が困難な場合や現場状況の情報がない場合に意識障害やショック，脱力などの原因として薬物中毒も鑑別に挙げなければならない。特に重篤となるのは，尿中薬物スクリーニングキットで検出可能な睡眠薬や抗うつ薬よりも，検出されない循環器系薬剤や抗てんかん薬であり，独居高齢者の死亡の原因になり得る。 本論文の全著者に，規定されたCOIはない。

Importantly, the occasional but limited use of addictive substances is clinically distinct from escalated substance use, loss of control over substance intake, and the emergence of chronic compulsive substance-seeking that characterizes addiction.

Por otro lado, la depresion es un trastorno del estado de animo que en altos niveles de gravedad muestra en adultos mayores alteraciones cognitivas significativas que pueden confundirse con un sindrome demencial. Se reporta el caso de una mujer de 75 anos de edad con datos de un probable trastorno depresivo mayor y con quejas de perdida de memoria desde hace 3 anos. A la evaluacion neuropsicologica se observan alteraciones cognitivas importantes en el funcionamiento mnesico ademas del funcionamiento ejecutivo, caracterizados por: una deficiente capacidad de aprendizaje de nueva informacion con respecto a lo esperado para su edad y nivel de escolaridad, una perdida importante de elementos visuales y auditivos a corto y largo plazo, ademas de una significativa presencia de perseveraciones e intrusiones, con un marcado deficit en el automonitoreo. Como apoyo los estudios de neuroimagen muestran disminucion del volumen cortical en regiones temporoparietales bilateral, asi como hipoperfusion asociada a dichas zonas. Con los resultados de la evaluacion neuropsicologica en correlacion con las dificultades en las actividades de la vida diaria, mas los estudios de neuroimagen, se puede apoyar el diagnostico de posible demencia tipo Alzheimer, descartando el de pseudo demencia por depresion.",

      "title": "Neurological Disorders in Medical Use of Cannabis: An Update",
      "abstract": "Medical cannabis is increasingly used as a treatment or adjunct treatment with different levels of efficacy in several neurological disorders or related symptoms (such as multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, Tourette's syndrome, Huntington's disease, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, headache), as well as in other medical conditions (e.g. nausea and vomiting, glaucoma, appetite stimulation, cancer, inflammatory conditions, asthma). Nevertheless, a number of neurological adverse effects from use of medical cannabis on the short- and on the longterm have been reported, in addition to other adverse health events.It has been noticed that the use of medical cannabis can lead to a paradoxical effects depending on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -like cannabinoids the preparation contain. Accordingly, some neurological disorders or symptoms (e.g. multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache) may be caused or exacerbated by the same treatment supposed to cure them. The current review presents an update of the neurological adverse effects resulting from the use of cannabis for medical purposes, highlighting the need to weigh the benefits and risks, when using cannabinoidbased treatments.",

The syndrome may occur in cases of apparent health or show itself as an exacerbation during any form of schizophrenia. The heredobiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms, and the clinical course prove that this syndrome does not represent a separate schizophrenic group but merely a complication. The symptoms are: A prodromal phase which lasts from 2 weeks to a few months and shows the usual schizophrenic pattern. First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse. Autopsy Findings.—Negative except for petechial hemorrhages into the tissues, and transformation of the fatty bone marrow to the erythropoietic state. A theory of possible \"asthenic metabolic changes\" due to disturbances in the hormonal-vegetative system, and its practical application were discussed.",

This apparent lack of response is either due to \"pseudo-resistance\" (a failure to have received and adhered to a recognized and effective treatment or treatments for their condition) or to true \"treatment resistance.\" Pseudo-resistance can be due to clinician errors in selecting and delivering an appropriate treatment effectively, or to patient nonadherence to a course of treatment. True treatment resistance can be due to unrecognized exogenous anxiogenic factors (eg, caffeine overuse, sleep deprivation, use of alcohol or marijuana) or an incorrect diagnosis (eg, atypical bipolar illness, occult substance abuse, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder). Once the above factors are eliminated, treatment should focus on combining effective medications and cognitive behavioral therapy, combining several medications (augmentation), or employing novel medications or psychotherapies not typically indicated as first-line evidence-based anxiety treatments.",

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "abstract": "– Lorsque survient un evenement penible ou effrayant, les enfants et les adolescents peuvent exprimer leur souffrance par leur comportement et leurs attitudes mais elle peut aussi passer inapercue. – Face a une situation penible ou effrayante, les jeunes victimes reagissent rarement par un stress adapte. Generalement, elles manifestent des reactions de stress depasse sous forme d’etat de choc ou d’agitation, voire de reactions mecaniques dont l’apparente normalite est souvent trompeuse. Ces reactions sont marquees par la detresse peri-traumatique et les symptomes dissociatifs.

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

      "abstract": "Systemic infection is often revealed by or associated with brain dysfunction, which is characterized by alteration of consciousness, ranging from delirium to coma, seizure or focal neurological signs. Its pathophysiology involves an ischemic process, secondary to impairment of cerebral perfusion and its determinants and a neuroinflammatory process that includes endothelial activation, alteration of the blood–brain barrier and passage of neurotoxic mediators. Microcirculatory dysfunction is common to these two processes. This brain dysfunction is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and long-term cognitive disability. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurological examination that can lead to specific investigations, including electrophysiological testing or neuroimaging. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis is indisputably required when meningitis is suspected. Hepatic, uremic or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, sedative or opioid withdrawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium or Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses. Currently, treatment consists mainly of controlling sepsis. The effects of insulin therapy and steroids need to be assessed. Various drugs acting on sepsis-induced blood–brain barrier dysfunction, brain oxidative stress and inflammation have been tested in septic animals but not yet in patients.",

The occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in children does not reflect static disease entities, usually, but rather either diseases in process, which become evident in their final state in adulthood, or other social and cultural factors, such as abuse, trauma, and neglect. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is not a disease in itself, usually, but rather a mistaken diagnosis when distractibility or impulsivity is caused by mood illnesses or anxiety states. Long-term randomized data with amphetamines indicate no greater functional benefit than with psychosocial interventions for ADD. Notable harms exist, including stunted height and possible neurotoxicity.",

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

Over time, they lead to an important alteration of daily activities (domestic, social, professional) of the person. At present, with life expectancy continuing increasing all over the world and with 10% of the total world population being over 65, the incidence of neuro-degenerative and affective disorders becomes an important concern for specialists. Old age is accompanied by important changes in the person’s self perception and perception of the environment; although depression in the elderly is not different from depression in young age, clinical data have evidentiated a particular type of depressive disorder related to old age, characterized by: motivational deficiency, low concentration and attention capacity, psychomotor impairment, which are frequently accompanied by several organic degenerative diseases. Many times, depression of the elderly is underdiagnosed and remains insufficiently treated. Drug therapy should be associated with psychotherapy, in order to improve patient compliance and motivation. The antidepressants existing nowadays in therapy are more selective and with fewer side effects than the first generation antidepressants: serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertralin), serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (as venlafaxine) are preferred, taking into account the multiple health conditions that may coexist in the elderly patient.",

Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

As chronic alcohol consumption is often accompanied by malnutrition, it has been debated for a long time whether ALN is due purely to the toxic effect of alcohol or due to nutritional deficiencies. It has now become clear that the direct neurotoxic effect of alcohol and its metabolites causes ALN. This is an axonal sensorimotor, predominantly small-fiber polyneuropathy with dominant sensory symptoms. Malnutrition, especially thiamine deficiency may contribute to ALN, with motor symptoms becoming more prominent. Isolated deficiencies of thiamine, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, folate, and niacin can also cause a relatively specific neuropathy.",

      "title": "Alcohol and Opioid Peptides: Neuropharmacological Rationale for Physical Craving of Alcohol",
      "abstract": "Until recently alcoholism was regarded as an incurable psychological problem. During the last decade a chain of research has led to important hypotheses about the etiology of the physical craving of alcohol. Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiatelike substances (endorphins, enkephalins, and dynor-phins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroisoquinolines) can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the physiological craving for alcohol may be the result of a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiatelike substances as well as other neurochemical deficits (i.e., dopaminergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic). These neurochemical deficits can occur genetically or as a result of long-term heavy drinking.SUMMARYScrutiny of available data reveals the following salient points: (1) Ethanol and opiates have a common biochemical mechanism of action; (2) the metabolic condensation by-products of ethanol, tetrahydroisoquinolines, link ethanol and opiate actions by virtue of interaction at multiple opioid receptor sites in the brain; (3) inbred mice showing a prediction toward alcohol preference exhibit significant differences of brain opiate peptides (endorphins and enkephalins) relative to mice showing an aversion to alcohol. Stress induces significant brain reductions of endogenous opioid peptides and induces copious alcohol consumption. Long-term ethanol ingestion remarkably reduces animal brain endorphins and enkephalins. Similarly, cerebrospinal fluid endorphin levels are reduced in human alcoholics, as are plasma enkephalin levels [40].Both acute and chronic treatment with D-phenylalanine and hydrocin-namic acid, known carboxypeptidase A (enkephalinase) inhibitors, significantly attenuate both forced and volitional ethanol intake, in mice with a genetic predisposition to prefer alcohol. These animals are known to have innate brain enkephalin deficiencies. Since these agents, through their enkephalinase inhibitory activity, raise brain enkephalin levels, we propose that excessive alcohol intake can be regulated by alteration of endogenous brain opioid peptadergic functionality and interaction with other neuroaminergic pathways.",

      "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder with or without hyperactivity disorder is a neurobiological disorder that involves the interaction of the neuroanatomical and neurotransmitter systems. It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

En ambos casos de criminalidad la causa de la delincuencia es el consumo de drogas. El Codigo penal de 1995 presta especial atencion al problema del consumo y la dependencia de las drogas aportando una regulacion especifica sobre la incidencia que sobre la capacidad de culpabilidad tiene el consumo y la dependencia de las drogas. La eximente de intoxicacion requiere tres elementos: Un presupuesto biologico o psiquiatrico, un estado de intoxicacion en el momento de cometer el delito un componente psicologico, imposibilidad de comprender el caracter ilicito de su conducta o de actuar conforme a ese conocimiento y un requisito\nnegativo, que la intoxicacion no haya sido provocada con el proposito de cometer el delito o que el sujeto haya previsto o debido prever que en estado de intoxicacion podria cometer un delito. El sindrome de abstinencia es una alteracion psiquica que se caracteriza por un sindrome especifico, que viene determinado por la clase de sustancia, debido al cese o reduccion del consumo prolongado de esa sustancia. El estado carencial crea una presion motivacional que explica la falta de libertad en el proceso de determinacion de la voluntad para actuar conforme a la norma. La adiccion a sustancias psicoactivas se define como un estado psiquico y fisico determinado por el consumo continuado de droga durante un periodo de tiempo, que se caracteriza por la perdida del control en el uso de la susta\nncia. La introduccion de la atenuante de grave adiccion supone reconocer que el consumo de drogas reiterado puede ocasionar una adiccion a las sustancias, que influye en la capacidad volitiva del sujeto limitando de forma relevante su\ncapacidad de actuar conforme a la norma dado la compulsion al consumo de esa sustancia. Desde esta concepcion de la grave adiccion lo coherente hubiera sido reconocer a la grave adiccion como un supuesto de semi-imputabilidad y no como una mera atenuante de la culpabilidad. Lo que permitiria, sin necesidad de acudir a la analogia in bonam partem, aplicar al adicto la medida de seguridad de tratamiento de deshabituacion.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

The mentioned behavioral alteration contributes significantly to the development of disfunctionality in different spheres of functioning and in appearance of physical and mental disorders. Therefore, the addicts almost as a rule manifest the psychiatric phenomenology. In psychiatric diagnostic practice, special attention is given to differentiation of symptoms caused by general medical condition or the use of alcohol and/or psychoactive substances.

Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour.

      "abstract": "Reading difficulties in children may represent one facet of general intellectual backwardness, often first recognised by delay in passing milestones including speech. Other forms of reading retardation may be due to defects of vision, or hearing or to brain damage. Some children have specific difficulties in learning to read without any other abnormalities of intellect, though it is debatable whether dyslexia (a ‘specific syndrome wherein particular difficulty exists in learning the conventional meaning of verbal symbols, and of associating the sound with symbol in appropriate fashion’ 1 ) should be separated from other reading difficulties that may present similarly. 2 Unless treated it may persist throughout childhood and is often familial. 3 It is more common in boys than girls. It is occasionally associated with general clumsiness, but quite often with confusion in right-left differentiation in copying shapes and in spelling. Emotional disturbances, slow comprehension, lack of motivation, social deprivation and poor or interrupted schooling may also result in backwardness in reading.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

      "abstract": "Psychology and its allied behavioural disciplines have been increasingly recognized for their contributions in helping to understand addiction and its treatment. This chapter explores alcohol as a major psychoactive drug. Many of the basic observations about alcohol-behaviour interactions have implications for dependence. It considers various approaches to specific aetiology of alcoholism and its treatment, before looking at drug dependence in general as an addictive process. In the field of psychopharmacology, researchers have found the effects of alcohol a useful tool in the study of fundamental psychological mechanisms, while others have been interested in such research for clinical reasons. The dangers of using a particular drug are often associated with the drug's potential to cause addiction, or physical dependence as it is commonly referred to. Habituation is the repeated use of a drug because the user finds that each use increases pleasurable feelings or reduces feelings of anxiety, fear, or stress.",

Some of the developmental changes and characteristics in late adulthood are as follows: deterioration of sensory/perceptual and intellectual abilities, changes of personality characteristics, the negative effects of compulsory retirement and loss of social roles, and death of one`s spouse. In addition to those developmental events, learned helplessness and the ineffective functioning of personality system in the aged are discussed. With those of specific changes and events in old age, the psychopathology-especially, depression-is analyzed in detail.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

Mainly, these psychedelic drugs have been used since ancient times. The most famous psychedelics that were used abundantly were magic mushrooms, mescaline, and DMT, which people used for smoking, swallowing, or inhaling. Mushrooms were usually eaten fresh, cooked, or mixed with tea. Occasionally, people of the ancient period used to take it with tobacco or cannabis. The common forms of NBOMe are inactive when swallowed; the most common methods of taking them are under the tongue, held on the cheek, or snorted.

      "title": "Agitation und Aggression in der Psychiatrie",
      "abstract": "Akute Agitation und Aggression zählen mit einer Prävalenz mit über 10 % zu den häufigsten medizinischen Notfallsituationen in der Psychiatrie [1]. Fast jeder zweite Patient, der in eine psychiatrische Notaufnahme kommt, weist Symptome von Agitation auf. Im deutschsprachigen Raum wird unter Agitation in der Regel ein Syndrom verstanden, das durch psychomotorische Unruhe, Erregung und Gespanntheit gekennzeichnet ist und das von stillem Negativismus bis hin zur Hostilität reichen kann [2]. Diese können in wechselnder Ausprägung und in der Intensität rasch veränderlich vorliegen. Häufig wird weitgehend synonym, aber doch mit etwas anderem Schwerpunkt der Begriff (psychomotorischer) Erregungszustand verwendet, der vor allem durch eine ausgeprägte Antriebssteigerung sowie motorische Hyperaktivität gekennzeichnet ist. Sowohl Agitation als auch psychomotorischer Erregungszustand können schließlich mit Gereiztheit, Aggressivität und Kontrollverlust einhergehen. In der angloamerikanischen Literatur wird Agitation dagegen besonders durch ausgeprägte motorische oder verbale Hyperaktivität oder durch Reizbarkeit und unkooperatives Verhalten charakterisiert [3], ein Bild, das eher dem (psychomotorischen) Erregungszustand nach deutschem Verständnis entspricht. Konkrete Anzeichen von Agitation sind z. B. motorische Unruhe, Hin-und-Her-Gehen, intensives Gestikulieren, laute Sprache mit Drohgebärden, Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität sowie mangelnde Kooperation. Die Übergänge zwischen Agitation und Aggression sind fließend. Mündet Agitation in Aggression, kann sich daraus eine akute Gefährdung des Patienten oder seines sozialen Umfelds entwickeln [4]. Aggression umfasst jegliche Form von verbalem, nonverbalem oder körperlichem Verhalten, das für den Patienten selbst, für andere Personen oder für deren Eigentum bedrohlich ist. Agitiertes Verhalten führt häufig zu Aggression und Gewalt. Bei psychiatrischen Patienten wird in bis zu über 80 % der Gewaltdelikte agitiertes Verhalten beobachtet. Insbesondere unbehandelte, junge, männliche Patienten mit Psychosen gelten als Hochrisikogruppe, vor allem, wenn komorbider Substanzmissbrauch hinzukommt [5].",

Firefighters and other crisis responders are often exposed to incidents in their work environments and are at risk of developing acute or posttraumatic symptomatology, depression, and anxiety, as well as harmful patterns of alcohol consumption. Most prior research and theory suggests that many firefighters use alcohol to cope with past and current stressors, and that increased drinking accompanies ongoing exposures to stressful occupational hazards.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Occupational stress was perceived to be a problem only in jobs with high pressure and low pay, such as teaching and social services. Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

Drug treatment may be considered in the overall treatment of comorbid conditions. Lifetime risk of any eating disorder is 8.4% in women and 2.2% in men. Those with eating disorders may misuse medication and substances to manage their weight (e.g. laxatives, diuretics, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder stimulants, slimming pills, semaglutide and caffeine). Other psychiatric conditions (particularly anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder) often coexist with eating disorders, and this may in part explain the benefit sometimes seen with medication. Doubts remain about the long‐term cardiovascular effects of stimulant drugs.

      "title": "Anger Disorders",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Anger is a frequently experienced emotion for most people (1). When mild to moderate in intensity and expressed in constructive, nonhostile ways, anger can lead to positive, adaptive behaviors such as expressing feelings; asserting one's rights, thoughts, and feelings; problem solving; redressing concerns; setting appropriate limits on the behavior of others; and motivating effective behavior (1,2). Anger, however, is a double-edged sword, often leading to many negative outcomes. For example, chronic anger and hostility are associated with health problems such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, compromised immune functioning, dental problems, and overall mortality (3). Intense anger is often associated with marital discord, abusive parenting, intimate partner violence, and other relationship problems (4,5). Anger has also been implicated in school violence, bullying, and disrupted teen relations. Anger may also lead to major or minor property damage (4), and an overall propensity to aggression and violence (6). Anger is also associated with reduced work effectiveness and problems such as being placed on probation, demotion, and termination (7). For some angry individuals, their anger is totally externalized and entirely justified, leaving their sense of self untouched. For others, however, their anger impairs their sense ofpsychological well-being; they feel out of control and overwhelmed by their anger and feel anxious, embarrassed, guilty, ashamed, and depressed by their anger and anger-related reactions. While these are but a few examples, anger and its dysfunctional expression affects the physical, psychological, interpersonal, educational, and vocational lives of many people.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

The characteristics of different types of long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) processes are summarized with an attempt to relate these to various structures in the brain. LTM is typically impaired by chronic alcohol intake but according to some data a single dose of ethanol may have long lasting effects if administered at a critically important age. The most commonly seen deleterious acute effect of alcohol to STM appears following large doses of ethanol in conditions of “binge drinking” causing the “blackout” phenomenon. However, with the application of various techniques and well-structured behavioral paradigms it is possible to detect, albeit occasionally, subtle changes of cognitive processes even as a result of a low dose of alcohol. These data may be important for the consideration of legal consequences of low-dose ethanol intake in conditions such as driving, etc.",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno psiquiátrico que presenta según el DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)(1), síntomas característicos como ideas delirantes, alucinaciones, lenguaje desorganizado (por ejemplo, descarrilamiento frecuente o incoherencia), comportamiento catatónico o gravemente desorganizado, síntomas negativos, (por ejemplo, aplanamiento afectivo, alogia o abulia), que afecta principalmente a personas en edad productiva, con alto impacto en la calidad de vida del paciente y en su entorno familiar y social. En este estudio se describe el comportamiento de los factores farmacológicos y no farmacológicos que alteran la adherencia al tratamiento, de 85 pacientes con esquizofrenia, dados de alta de la Unidad de Salud Mental (USM), del Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo de Neiva (HUHMP), mediante revisión de la historia clínica y la entrevista telefónica del acudiente, familiar o del mismo paciente. La mayoría de los pacientes encuestados son adultos jóvenes, de género masculino, solteros, procedentes del departamento del Huila, con baja escolaridad, sin vinculo laboral en el momento del estudio. Se encontró un nivel bajo de adherencia al tratamiento, el cual es directamente proporcional al grado de introspección del paciente, al apoyo familiar y/o social, a la prescripción de antipsicóticos atípicos, a la buena relación médico-paciente e inversamente proporcional al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, a la prescripción de medicamentos típicos, y a la presencia de reacciones adversas. El conocer estos comportamientos, es un precedente para futuras investigaciones y además es punto de partida para crear estrategias que permitan mejorar la tasa de adherencia al tratamiento por parte de los pacientes esquizofrénicos, desde un punto de vista integral e individualizado a la vez.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a serious behavioral disorder. It is a long term evolving process characterized by dependency. It is not only biological and psychological but also social. It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief. These psychological disorders frequently underlie medical care needs.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

      "abstract": "Correctly recognising that alcohol or other substances are causing problems is a necessary condition for those problems to spur beneficial behaviour change. Yet such recognition is neither immediate nor straightforward. Recognition that one’s alcohol or drug use is causing negative consequences often occurs gradually. Contemporary addiction neuroscience has yet to make progress in understanding and addressing these recognition barriers, despite evidence that lack of problem recognition is a primary impediment to seeking treatment. Based on our recent empirical work, this article shows how recognition barriers can emerge from dual constraints on how we learn about the negative consequences of our actions. One constraint is imposed by the characteristics of negative consequences themselves. A second constraint is imposed by the characteristics of human cognition and information processing. In some people, the joint action of these constraints causes lack of correct awareness of the consequences of their behaviour and reduced willingness to update that knowledge and behaviour when confronted with counterevidence. This ‘cognitive pathway’ can drive persistent, maladaptive choice.",

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "abstract": "One of the reasons for the development or worsening of cognitive impairment (CI) may be the use of a number of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, glucocorticosteroids, antitumor drugs and a number of others. The negative effect of drugs on cognitive functions is realized due to many pathophysiological mechanisms: disruption of hormonal regulation, decreased neuronal excitability, increased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, decreased cerebral circulation, atrophic changes in the brain; many mechanisms have not been fully established. Risk factors for the development of drug-induced CIs are: old age or childhood, brain damage, chronic diseases, genetic factors, the patient's initial CI, polypharmacy, dose and duration of drug use, acute infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, dehydration, acute urinary retention, etc. To diagnose and differentially diagnose drug-induced CI, it is necessary to establish a connection between the start of taking a suspected drug-inducer and a decrease in cognitive functions. The first step in the treatment of drug-induced CI is the abolition of an inducer drug or a reduction in its dose, in cases where it is impossible to discontinue the drug and there is no replacement, special slow-release dosage forms can be considered. The main measures to prevent drug-induced CI include the use of drugs with the lowest risk of their development, assessment of drug interactions, and the use of modern scales to assess the risk of developing this side-effect (anticholinergic burden scale, etc.).",

      "title": "Hipoglikemijski sindromi - dijagnostički i terapijski pristup i prikaz dva slučaja",
      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

      "abstract": "To review the effects of alcohol dependence on physical and mental health.Alcohol dependence is wide-spread among people of all ages and socioeconomic groups. Persons with alcohol dependence face enormous health consequences. Alcohol dependence is a major cause of mortality and is associated with psychiatric conditions, neurologic impairment, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and malignant neoplasms. Psychiatric conditions associated with alcohol dependence include major depression, dysthymia, mania, hypomania, panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, personality disorders, any drug use disorder, schizophrenia, and suicide. Psychiatric comorbidity, in turn, is associated with alcohol-related symptoms of greater severity. Excessive alcohol consumption causes brain damage, as evidenced by brain imaging, and related neurologic deficits, including impairments in working memory, cognitive processing of emotional signals, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, and gait and balance. Whereas moderate alcohol consumption is cardioprotective, heavy drinking is associated with increased risks of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and ischemic stroke, possibly due to alcohol-induced sympathetic activation. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption is a strong risk factor for various types of cancer, particularly cancers of the aero-respiratory tract, but also cancers of the digestive system, liver, breast, and ovaries. Heavy drinking is associated with various forms of alcoholic liver disease, such as cirrhosis. (People with alcohol dependence die from cirrhosis at a much higher rate than is found in the general population.) Alcohol dependence also increases the risk of injury, possibly due to alcohol-related factors such as diminished coordination and balance, increased reaction time, and impaired attention, perception, and judgment.Alcohol dependence has numerous and serious ill effects on physical and mental health and represents a major public health burden.",

Catatonia syndrome occurs in many neuropsychiatric and medical conditions, but it is very rarely mentioned as occurring during alcohol withdrawal. We think that this co-occurrence could be underestimated in clinics because alcohol withdrawal symptoms may distract from its identification. Methods: We report the case of a patient presenting with catatonia during the benzodiazepine reduction period of alcohol detoxification. Results: A 65-year-old woman presented with a 15-year history of alcohol dependence and developed catatonic episodes several times during alcohol withdrawal treatment. Misdiagnosis delayed specific treatment. Symptoms of episodes dramatically improved 48 h after treatment with diazepam and revealed an anxiety disorder. Conclusion: This report confirms that catatonia is a non-specific response to psychological, physical and psychosocial stress factors. Recent alcohol withdrawal may sensitize the patient to benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia, and this phenomenon is probably underestimated. Catatonia Rating Scales can be useful when diagnosis is complicated as in alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal. In that situation, misdiagnosis is common and may delay specific treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’.

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions.

      "title": "First Episode Psychosis Following COVID-19 Vaccination: a Case Report.",
      "abstract": "Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.",

Recent research suggests that people with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) may be more prone to alcohol-related aggression than people without ASPD. As a group, people with ASPD have higher rates of alcohol dependence and more alcohol-related problems than people without ASPD. Likewise, in laboratory studies, people with ASPD show greater increases in aggressive behavior after consuming alcohol than people without ASPD. The association between ASPD and alcohol-related aggression may result from biological factors, such as ASPD-related impairments in the functions of certain brain chemicals (e.g., serotonin) or in the activities of higher reasoning, or \"executive,\" brain regions. Alternatively, the association between ASPD and alcohol-related aggression may stem from some as yet undetermined factor(s) that increase the risk for aggression in general.",

At its core, impulsivity arises through an inability to adequately suppress or inhibit inappropriate behaviour and by a general intolerance to delayed gratification, a tendency also widely found in abstinent drug addicts. Despite intensive research, however, it remains unclear whether impulsivity arises from neural abnormalities produced by the chronic exposure of individuals to drugs such as alcohol and cocaine ('state impulsivity') potentially via interactions with medial temporal lobe and frontal cortical structures (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) or whether instead 'trait impulsivity' and brain disorders linked to it – for example, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – predispose to drug use and addiction. This chapter considers both possibilities from a neural systems and psychological perspective drawing on evidence from animal models and clinical research.",

Nymphomania can be defined in terms of three distinct elements: marked increase in sexual drive; extremely frequent partner sexual behavior; promiscuity. The essence of the problem, however, is the disruptive increase in desire. Causes often involve one or more of the following: acting out; atypical psychoses; alcohol and/or drug abuse; temporal lobe disorders; involvement with an inappropriate partner; response to another sexual dysfunction. Many of these women are unable to derive emotional satisfaction from sex.",

      "abstract": "Negli ultimi decenni, il concetto di dipendenza ha subito un'e- spansione significativa, estendendosi oltre le classiche dipendenze da sostanze, come droghe e alcol, per includere una gamma di comportamenti che possono manifestare caratteristiche simili di compulsività e perdita di controllo. Queste dipendenze comportamentali, \"addiction senza sostanze\", comprendono una varietà di attività come il gioco d'azzardo patologico, la dipendenza da inter- net e dai social media, lo shopping compulsivo, la dipendenza da sesso e l'uso eccessivo di videogiochi, tra gli altri. Con il termine \"addiction\" si definisce una condizione generale in cui la dipendenza psicologica spinge alla ricerca dell'oggetto, senza di esso la propria esistenza perde significato. Nello specifico facciamo riferimento ad una serie di condotte disfunzionali nelle quali l'oggetto della dipendenza non è una sostanza ma un determinato comportamento. Esse si caratterizzano per la presenza di comportamenti ripetitivi che il soggetto tro- va difficili da controllare nonostante le conseguenze negative. Similmente alle dipendenze da sostanze, queste comportano una ricerca compulsiva del com- portamento, tolleranza ovvero il bisogno di aumentare l'intensità o la frequenza del comportamento per ottenere lo stesso effetto, l'elevato impiego di risorse in termini economici di energia e tempo, e sintomi di astinenza psicologica quan- do il comportamento viene interrotto. Inoltre, le dipendenze comportamentali spesso portano a un deterioramento significativo delle relazioni personali, della performance lavorativa e della salute fisica e mentale. Questo fenomeno ha at- tirato l'attenzione della comunità scientifica, evidenziando la necessità di una comprensione più approfondita dei meccanismi sottostanti, delle conseguenze sulla salute mentale e fisica e delle strategie di trattamento efficaci.

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

After birth, many suffer from abandonment, institutionalization, malnutrition, recurrent illnesses, environmental deprivation, and/or emotional neglect. Some are physically or sexually abused, or witness distressing events. These stressful experiences in early life may permanently alter brain physiology and lead to long-lasting physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes. Early stress may have lifelong adverse effects on growth, development, health, behavior, learning, and memory.

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

      "title": "A Study on Emotional Intelligence, Family Environment, Mental Health Problems & Pro-Social Behavior",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAdolescence is recognized as an age of difficulties caused by rapid physical, emotional, intellectual and social changes that accompany it. Adolescents struggle and face newly encountered obstacles such as awkwardness, self discovery, independence, educational demands and puberty. This period is a critical period and needs lot of emotional regulatory skill development.Emotional Intelligence is defined as a major part of an individual's character that includes abilities such as being able (i) to motivate oneself (ii) persist in the face of frustrations (iii) to control impulses for (iv) to delay gratifications (v) to regulate moods (vi) to keep distress from swamping the ability to think (vii) to empathize and (viii) to hope.People with low emotional intelligence display behaviors and characteristics like poor impulse control, low self esteem, depression and suicidal feelings, aggressive behavior and self harm, increased stress, increased alcohol and drug use and even personality disorder due to insufficient ability to manage their emotions. In contrast, high emotional intelligence has been linked with increased well-being such as greater satisfaction with life and increased happiness.Quality emotions and feelings help students give their best potential in the classroom. The students who think negatively cannot concentrate for a long time and have more difficulty in reaching their potential than others.Family system is where the child learns when and how to express feelings, manage conflict, and negotiate differences. The general climate of the family will teach the child certain norms, values, and interpersonal skills. Family in general and parents in particular, are the important support system (Cox and Cox 1979).Expressed emotion has emerged as an important variable in studies of family and psychopathology. It is regarded as a measure of environmental stress in the home. Perceived criticism negatively correlates with emotional intelligence. People who perceived their families to be critical of them also perceive their family to be less close, less adaptable and perceive themselves to have less social support. Perceived criticism positively correlates with income, education of the parents. Respondent who perceived their family's intensely emotionally involved reported more social support and higher cohesion and adaptability. Perceived criticism had a higher correlation with depression and anxiety. This findings support the view that Expressed emotion may be related to a range of psychological problems.Need & importance of the studyVarious factors contribute to mental health problems. Studies reviewed showed that some demographic variables such as gender, parental occupational levels and family income had an influence on mental health and emotional well-being of adolescent. Research evidence showed few dimensions of emotional intelligence, perceived family environment and low pro-social behavior contributed to mental health problems of adolescents.OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDYTo analyze the influence of demographic variables on emotional intelligence and perceived family environment.To analyze the relationship between emotional intelligence, perceived family environment and mental health problems and pro-social behavior in adolescence.METHODThe design adopted was expost facto and primarily descriptive in nature.Variables in the study were as follows:Independent variables - Demographic variables - gender, parental education, occupation, family income, emotional intelligence, perceived family environment.Dependent variables - Mental health problems, pro-social behavior.SampleSample was selected from three aided schools in semi urban areas. One was girls' school and the other two were co-educational schools.

La cirugia funcional ha adquirido gran relevancia en el tratamiento de las complicaciones motoras de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) avanzada, y menos conocida es la influencia de la estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP) en los sintomas no motores (SNM). Objetivo. Revisar la bibliografia sobre ECP y SNM en la EP. Desarrollo. Los resultados de la cirugia funcional sobre los SNM de la EP son variables en los distintos estudios. Algunos sintomas mejoran -trastornos del sueno, dolor o disconfort, trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos- y empeoran o aparecen otros -fluencia verbal, apatia, aumento de peso-. En estudios aislados se encuentra mejoria en memoria de trabajo, secuenciacion visuomotora y razonamiento, algunos trastornos digestivos, genitourinarios, de termorregulacion y olfativos, y empeoran la memoria verbal (recuerdo diferido) y visuoespacial, la velocidad psicomotora y la funcion ejecutiva, mientras que otros sintomas -hipotension ortostatica- no muestran cambios. Existen otros factores, ademas de la estimulacion, que pueden modificar los SNM, como la vulnerabilidad preoperatoria individual, la disminucion de medicacion dopaminergica tras la cirugia, la propia EP y los cambios psicosociales. En pacientes con perfiles determinados pueden existir riesgos especificos -mayor riesgo de alteracion cognitiva en pacientes de mas de 69 anos o con alteracion cognitiva precirugia; mayor riesgo de depresion, mania o suicidio en pacientes con patologia psiquiatrica previa-. Conclusiones. Es necesario valorar el riesgo-beneficio individualmente para obtener resultados optimos con este tratamiento. Se requieren estudios multicentricos que permitan esclarecer el papel de la ECP sobre los SNM.",

Adjustment of later-life depressives after psychiatric treatment is virtually an unknown area, as is the phenomenon of depression itself with this population. This study addressed these two issues. Community adjustment of younger and older clinically depressed patients after treatment was monitored. Also, adjustment differences in self and other ratings were compared between the two age groups. Results show that there are no significant differences in posttreatment adjustment ratings between the age groups. In addition, it was found that older depressives with a longer history of depression adjust less well than expected. Lastly, older depressives (relative to younger ones), particularly neurotic ones, show the following pattern of adjustment: Less alienation, less vigor, less confidence in skills, poorer work history, less abuse of alcohol or drugs, more social constriction, more agitation, and fewer household management skills.",

Neurological impairments found in individuals diagnosed with FASD are pervasive across the lifespan and are often accompanied by multiple co-morbid disorders. Some of these co-morbid conditions may include: Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder (Burd et al., 2003), Reactive Attachment Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Bi-Polar Disorder, and Conduct Disorder (Green et al., 2009). FASD-related consequences could also lead to homelessness, serious mental health concerns, substance use issues, and an increased risk of violent behavior (Steinahuseen & Spohr, 1998; Streissguth et al., 1996).",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

L'exces de vigilance que representent la tension (stress) ou l'hyperexcitation a un pouvoir de degradation plus rapide sur les activites complexes que sur les activites les plus simples. Il y a donc un niveau optimal de vigilance pour chaque type de tâche realisee et la degradation de la performance peut etre liee a de l'hypovigilance ou de l'hypervigilance. L'effet du manque d'experience des jeunes conducteurs pourrait se faire particulierement sentir dans des situations de conduite difficiles ou des situations auxquelles ils n'ont pas forcement ete confrontes lors de leur apprentissage, mais aussi dans des situations ou l'effet de plusieurs facteurs d'accident est additif. En ce sens, un etat de surcharge de travail pourrait entrainer un etat de forte tension et d'hypervigilance chez les jeunes conducteurs novices. A l'inverse, l'ingestion d'un psychotrope tel l'alcool pourrait avoir un effet deletere sur leur comportement de conduite lors de situations monotones de longue duree, et favoriser la baisse de vigilance.

      "abstract": "Among well-known side effects such as dizziness, nausea, headache and diplopia medical treatment of epilepsy may cause side effects on cognition, mood and behavior. In special constellations this can profoundly affect compliance with the medication as well as quality of life. Some patients are more vulnerable to side effects than others. Side effects can have profound impact on the development and future life of a patient. Some antiepileptic drugs (e.g. topiramate, zonisamide) show a more severe side effect profile than others (e.g. lamotrigine, levetiracetam). Thus, in the treatment of epilepsy, it is crucial to consider such possible side effects – especially in the beginning of or while changing the medical treatment. Specific neuropsychological examinations can monitor side effects on cognitive functions like concentration, memory or speech function. If this is not possible in an ambulant setting, specific screening instruments and repeated and precise interviews of patients and/or relatives can help to discover potential side effects. Because most side effects can be reversible, dosage modification or drug replacement is required as soon as incompatibilities are discovered.",

In addition to cognitive symptoms such as memory loss and language impairment, patients with AD often develop behavioral symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

It has been found that among the representatives of bodies and institutions of execution of punishments the most common are socially acceptable or neutral or comparatively dangerous types of addictive behavior, in particular computer or Internet addiction, workaholism, etc. Among the more socially dangerous forms of addictive behavior, chemical addictions (the use of alcohol and other psychoactive substances – cannabinoids, opiates, psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, etc.), hallucinogens of natural and synthetic origin, as well as the abuse of hypnotic-sedative drugs) and non-chemical addictions (addictions), which at this time, according to researchers, there are currently more than two hundred forms (pathological tendency to gambling; ludomania – sweepstakes, lotteries, slot machines, casinos, less often – card games) are common.

In the case of 20 patients suicidal actions occurred in former years or before the present treatment after the death of their mother, father or husband or wife. Of essential importance are the reactions of the people closely about them, the setting-off of or the transition into an endogenous depression, a distinct dependence on the deceased and ambivalence of feelings, self-reproach and feelings of guilt, and the inability for or avoidance of conscious mourning. In the case of chronically suicidal patients the therapy turns out to be especially difficult, if a real work of mourning does not succeed.",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Multiple Sklerose (MS) ist die häufigste degenerative Erkrankung des zentralen Nervensystems bei jungen Erwachsenen in den Industrienationen, einhergehend mit chronischen Entzündungen in Gehirn und Rückenmark und sukzessiver Demyelinisierung bzw. Zerstörung von Axonen. MS wird den Autoimmunerkrankungen zugeordnet, mit chronischem und meist schubförmigem Verlauf. Im Schub treten Ausfallerscheinungen wie Lähmungen, Erblinden oder kognitive Beeinträchtigungen auf. Die Ursachen sind ungeklärt. Zur pharmakologischen Therapie stehen u. a. Glukokortikoide und immunmodulierende Therapeutika zur Verfügung. Viele der körperlichen und psychosozialen Beeinträchtigungen wie Kau- und Schluckstörungen wirken sich direkt auf den Ernährungsstatus aus. Zusätzliche Beschwerden entstehen infolge unerwünschter Arzneimittelwirkungen, z. B. durch Glukokortikoide. Lähmung und psychosoziale Belastung tragen zur Adipositasentstehung bei. Im Resultat ist je nach Verlauf, das Risiko für Fehl-, Über- und/oder Unterernährung gegeben. Befragungen zeigten, dass ein hoher Anteil Betroffener unkontrolliert Nahrungssupplemente einnimmt bzw. einseitige Wunderdiäten durchführt, wodurch sich diese Risiken umso gravierender darstellen. Alle angeführten Punkte illustrieren den dringenden (Be-)Handlungsbedarf seitens Ernährungsmedizin und Ernährungsberatung, deren Vorteile unbestritten sind. Eine professionelle Anleitung kann der risikoreichen Eigenbehandlung entgegensteuern, bzw. zu Eigenständigkeit und Lebensqualität von MS-Kranken beitragen. Aktuell nehmen diese noch selten ernährungstherapeutische Beratung in Anspruch. Die ernährungsmedizinische Forschung konzentriert sich auf die Einflussnahme auf das Krankheitsgeschehen. Hinweise gibt es z. B. für die Zufuhr von n-3- und n-6-Fettsäuren oder Vitamin D. Die Literatur hierzu ist umfangreich, erlaubt aber keine generalisierbare Aussage über wirksame Ernährungsstrategien oder Supplementation explizit für MS-Kranke. Unabhängig von dieser Zielsetzung, besteht aber auch Bedarf, MS-Kranke bezüglich ihrer reellen Ernährungsrisiken adäquat zu beraten bzw. zu behandeln. Ein in der Zielgruppe noch zu evaluierendes Konzept erarbeiteten Adam et al. mit der „Anti Entzündlichen Diät“ (AED). Originär für rheumatische Erkrankungen entwickelt, lag aufgrund pathologischer Parallelen die Adaptation für MS nahe. Das Wirkprinzip beruht u. a. auf Modifikation der alimentären Fettzufuhr, basierend auf den generellen Empfehlungen für eine ausgewogene Ernährung und einer flexiblen, nichtrestriktiven Umsetzung.",

      "title": "Aportaciones de aripiprazol en el tratamiento de pacientes agudos con esquizofrenia.",
      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

In the field of clinical psychology, it is understood to contribute to many different forms of psychopathology (Whiteside &amp; Lynam, 2001). It is part of borderline personality disorder (a disorder characterized by emotional lability and ill‐considered, self‐harming acts); antisocial personality disorder (characterized by rash, ill‐thought out acts that often harm others); attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (characterized by difficulty waiting one's turn and persevering on tasks); bulimia nervosa (characterized by binge eating and subsequent purging); alcohol and drug‐use disorders; and a whole set of impulse‐control disorders, such as kleptomania, pyromania, and intermittent explosive disorder. For many of these forms of psychopathology, impulsivity is understood to contribute to their emergence.",

En la version mas reciente del Manual Diagnostico y Estadistico de Trastornos \nMentales, se describe al autismo como un conjunto de modificaciones de la conducta que incluyen decremento en \nla interaccion social, decremento en las habilidades de comunicacion verbal o respuestas inapropiadas durante la \nconversacion, manifestaciones de conductas repetitivas o estereotipadas, carencia de empatia para entablar \nrelaciones afectivas y obsesiones inapropiadas sobre objetos especificos.

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

Alcoholics are remarkably tolerant to the intoxicating effects of ethanol.

Addiction to ethanol also occurs as a secondary complication in patients with specific neuropsychiatric disorders, but the vast majority of alcoholics do not have an antecedent history of major psychiatric disease; they are considered to have primary alcoholism. Alcohol abuse is characterized by prodigious drinking without evidence of physical dependence upon withdrawal. Such individuals continue to drink excessively, sometimes as binge drinkers for several days at a time, despite considerable personal socioeconomic hardship and serious medical complications.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

In order to improve diagnostic accuracy, clinicians can follow an algorithm that distinguishes among alcohol-related psychiatric symptoms and signs, alcohol-induced psychiatric syndromes, and independent psychiatric disorders that are commonly associated with alcoholism. The patient's gender, family history, and course of illness over time also should be considered to attain an accurate diagnosis. Moreover, clinicians need to remain flexible with their working diagnoses and revise them as needed while monitoring abstinence from alcohol KEY WORDS: AODD (alcohol and other drug dependence); diagnostic algorithm; diagnostic criteria; screening and diagnostic method for potential AODD; patient assessment; AODR (AOD related) mental disorder; behavioral and mental disorder; symptom; comorbidity; major depression; manicdepressive psychosis; personality disorder; anxiety; patient family history; medical history The evaluation of psychiatric complaints in patients with alcohol use disorders (i.e., alcohol abuse or dependence, which hereafter are collectively called alcoholism) can sometimes be challenging. Heavy drinking associated with alcoholism can coexist with, contribute to, or result from several different psychiatric syndromes. As a result, alcoholism can complicate or mimic practically any psychiatric syndrome seen in the mental health setting, at times making it difficult to accurately diagnose the nature of the psychiatric complaints (Anthenelli 1997; ModestoLowe and Kranzler 1999). When alcoholism and psychiatric disorders co-occur, patients are more likely to have difficulty maintaining abstinence, to attempt or commit suicide, and to utilize mental health services (Hetzer and Przybeck 1988; Kessler et al. 1997). Thus, a thorough evaluation of psychiatric complaints in alcoholic patients is important to reduce illness severity in these individuals. This article presents an overview of the common diagnostic difficulties associated with the comorbidity of alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders. It then briefly reviews the relationship between alcoholism and several psychiatric disorders that commonly co-occur with alcoholism and which clinicians should consider in their differential diagnosis. The article also provides some general guidelines to help clinicians meet the challenges encountered in the psychiatric assessment of alcoholic clients. DIAGNOSTIC DIFFICULTIES IN ASSESSING PSYCHIATRIC COMPLAINTS IN ALCOHOLIC PATIENTS A Case Example A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining. `Ifn going to end it all... life just not worth living. The clinician elicits an approximate 1-week history of depressed mood, feelings of guilt, and occasional suicidal ideas that have grown in intensity since the man's wife left him the previous day The client denies difficulty sleeping, poor concentration, or any changes in his appetite or weight prior to his wife's departure. He appears unshaven and slightly unkempt, but states that he was able to go to work and function on the job until his wife left, The scent of alcohol is present on the man's breath. When queried about this, he admits to having 'a few drinks to ease the pain earlier that morning, but does not expand on this theme. He seeks help for his low mood and demoralization, acknowledging later in the interview that really don't want to kill myself, I just want my life back to the way it used to be. The above case is a composite of many clinical examples observed across mental health settings each day, illustrating the challenges clinicians face when evaluating psychiatric complaints in alcoholic patients. The questions facing the clinician in this example include: * Is the patient clinically depressed in the sense that he has a major depressive episode requiring aggressive pharmacological and psychosocial treatment? …",

The medical literature presents and promotes red flags to increase the likelihood of identifying a secondary etiology. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches as well as the data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches. We review the following red flags: (1) systemic symptoms including fever; (2) neoplasm history; (3) neurologic deficit (including decreased consciousness); (4) sudden or abrupt onset; (5) older age (onset after 65 years); (6) pattern change or recent onset of new headache; (7) positional headache; (8) precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise; (9) papilledema; (10) progressive headache and atypical presentations; (11) pregnancy or puerperium; (12) painful eye with autonomic features; (13) posttraumatic onset of headache; (14) pathology of the immune system such as HIV; (15) painkiller overuse or new drug at onset of headache. Using the systematic SNNOOP10 list to screen new headache patients will presumably increase the likelihood of detecting a secondary cause. The lack of prospective epidemiologic studies on red flags and the low incidence of many secondary headaches leave many questions unanswered and call for large prospective studies. A validated screening tool could reduce unneeded neuroimaging and costs.",

      "title": "Alchol Use Disorder and Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "Alcohol is a colorless, pungent, bitter, flammable liquid. The type of alcohol consumed as a beverage is known as ethanol. In general, the term \"\"alcohol\"\" in our language refers to all intoxicating and alcohol-containing beverages. The use of alcohol dates back to ancient times in human history. Often preferred for its pleasurable effects, the repeated and prolonged use of alcohol can lead to addiction. The World Health Organization defines an alcohol addict as \"\"a person who consumes alcohol for an extended period and in atypical amounts, whose mental, physical, and social health deteriorates due to alcohol, who cannot assess their condition, and even if they can, cannot stop the desire to consume alcohol, and who requires treatment.\"\" Currently, the diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder are established by the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). Studies have shown that alcohol use disorder often does not occur in isolation but is accompanied by other psychiatric disorders. The co-occurrence of another psychiatric disorder with alcohol addiction is referred to as comorbidity. Some psychiatric disorders that may co-occur with alcohol dependence include anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and mood disorders. In this context, this chapter will address alcohol use disorder from both conceptual and legal perspectives, and examine its relationship with other psychiatric disorders, along with the frequency of their co-occurrence.",

      "abstract": "Several behavioral/psychological/psychiatric traits/disorders have been associated with increased initiation of smoking, nicotine dependence, and decreased cessation. Although much research has focused on psychiatric disorders, subclinical syndromes (e.g., minor depression and heavy drinking) probably influence smoking initiation and cessation more because they are so much more prevalent. In prospective studies, comorbidity predicts smoking and smoking predicts comorbidity. Preliminary evidence suggests several plausible mechanisms by which this two-way linkage could occur. In addition, other variables (e.g., genetics) could account for the comorbidity/smoking association. What we need to know: how strong and consistent are comorbidity/smoking associations? Is the association of smoking and comorbidity increasing over time? Are the hypothesized mechanisms for the association valid? Can treating comorbidity improve smoking cessation outcomes? Would applying the concept of comorbidity to psychosocial conditions (e.g., poverty) be helpful?",

Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices. This review article is a good educational material for medical and psychological practitioners whose goal is to improve knowledge and diagnostic processes of psychosis and its related disorders.",

In order to investigate the mechanisms of somatic anosognosia, the author studied 138 alcoholics in the second phase of the disease; half of them had physical disorders like myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, stomach ulcer and other internal diseases. The memory, concentration and intellectual problems found in persons studied with the help of diagnostic instruments were not significant and could not influence lack of insight on issue of drinking and severe somatic disorders. In the majority of cases (in the absence of symptoms of dementia) alcohol-related anosognosia happens to be a psychological defense that neutralizes the intrapersonal conflict. The latter is associated with the person's inability to live without alcohol and condemnation of his drinking by environment.",

      "abstract": "Medications with cognitive effects and/or side effects also affect sleep and dreaming. The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "title": "Marchiafava–Bignami Disease: A Rare Finding in Alcohol Dependence Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Marchiafava–Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare demyelinating disorder, associated with alcohol consumption over a prolonged period of time and malnutrition. Diagnosis is often missed due to symptoms mimicking other acute neurological conditions and approximately 250 cases have been reported worldwide.[1,2] This disease is characteristically diagnosed on neuroimaging, which is demonstrated as demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum.[3] We present the case of a 27-year-old male who presented with a history of road traffic accident under the influence of alcohol. He sustained injuries to the face and head, which was also associated with a brief loss of consciousness followed by agitation, altered sensorium, slurred speech, and gait abnormality. There was no history of posttraumatic seizure, vomiting, headache, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and hemotympanum. However, the patient was agitated, ataxic, and dysarthric with mild impairment in consciousness and the Glasgow Coma Scale on presentation was 10/15 (E3V3M4). Pupils were noticed to be of normal size and were normally reacting. There was no autonomic instability and neurological deficits on clinical examination. Noncontrast computed tomography head revealed an undisplaced fracture of the body of the mandible near the left angle of the mandible. There was no evidence of traumatic brain injury on the computed tomography (CT) scan. Laboratory results revealed a normal hematological profile, but the liver function tests revealed increased Serum Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (SGGT) 163 U/L, Serum Glutamic- Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT)-85 IU/L, Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT)-322 IU/L, and ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed hepatomegaly with Grade-1 fatty liver. The patient demonstrated progressively increasing psychomotor action and worsening altered sensorium (mini-mental state examination [MMSE]-24/30 and Montreal cognitive assessment [MOCA]-19/30) with poor ideomotor recovery. A history revealed progressively increasing alcohol consumption over a period of 7-year fulfilling criteria of alcohol dependence syndrome as per the International Classification of Diseases-10. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed hyperintensity in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum on the left side suggestive of Type B MBD [Figure 1]. The patient was started on high doses of injectable thiamine hydrochloride 1.5 g/day in an intravenous infusion and injectable multivitamins along with oral anticraving drugs in the form of acamprosate (333 mg 2-2-2) in conjunction with forced abstinence. The patient responded satisfactory to treatment with improvement of sensorium and restoration of normal psychomotor activity. After stabilization, he was imparted with structured Yoga and Meditation (YogNidra and Pranayam) therapy by a trained yoga therapist. Cognitive retraining with cognitive restructuring App (Luminous) along with individual and group psychotherapy by a clinical psychologist in a deaddiction center aimed at relapse prevention. Over the next 3 months, the patient's cognitive functions improved (MMSE - 30/30 and MOCA - 29/30). MRI brain repeated after 12 weeks of the treatment revealed complete resolution of lesions [Figure 2].Figure 1: MRI brain of the patient at initial presentation prior to the start of the treatment. (a) Axial T2-weighted MR image, (b) coronal T2-weighted MR image, and (c) axial FLAIR MR image reveal hyperintensities in the splenium of the corpus callosum on the left side, (d) sagittal T1-weighted MR image shows hypodensities in the splenium of the corpus callosum in the central part sparing peripheral most part showing \"Sandwich sign.\" MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging, MR: Magnetic resonance, FLAIR: Fluid-attenuated inversion recoveryFigure 2: MRI brain of the patient after 3 months of treatment. (a) Axial FLAIR image, (b) axial T1-weighted image, and (c) axial T2-weighted image show no abnormalities of the splenium. MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging, FLAIR: Fluid-attenuated inversion recoveryConsidering the history of road traffic accident under the influence of alcohol with facial trauma associated with mild impairment in consciousness, dysarthria, ataxic gait, and cognitive impairment in a patient with evidence of chronic alcohol use and the classical \"Sandwich Sign\" on MRI, the important differentials which considered were traumatic brain injury, Wernicke's encephalopathy, and MBD. The history of trauma associated with mild impairment of consciousness and orientation pointed toward a structural abnormality such as an extradural/subdural hematoma or intracerebral hemorrhage and diffuse axonal injury, but these were ruled out by the initial CT scan and MRI brain. The background of chronic alcohol intake over the last 7 years and the presence of the classical \"Sandwich sign\" on MRI, however, tilted the scales in the favor of possible MBD. In case of chronic alcoholics, Wernicke's encephalopathy needs to be considered; it presents with milder symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and a speedy recovery as compared to MBD. It further can be distinguished on MRI by the symmetrical involvement of the thalamus, hypothalamus, brain stem, and periaqueductal gray matter.[4] An absence of relapsing-remitting symptoms and absent periventricular white matter lesions on MRI excluded the diagnosis of Multiple sclerosis.[5] Studies suggested that B1-hypovitaminosis is the pathophysiology of the disease. Hence, early replenishment of thiamine may improve outcomes in MBD patients. Studies have shown that early initiation of treatment within 14 days of onset of symptoms with high-dose thiamine and multivitamins has proven to be statistically beneficial as compared to delayed treatment.[4] Better outcomes noted in MBD patient with parenteral administration of thiamine compared to oral administration might be due to delayed intestinal absorption and deranged hepatic uptake associated with chronic alcoholism.[6] In conclusion, MBD, though a rare clinical entity, is potentially reversible with an early diagnosis and prompt initiation of high-dose thiamine and supportive care along with adequate rehabilitation as seen in our patient.

      "title": "Stimulants",
      "abstract": "Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "title": "REVIEW: Behavioural assessment of drug reinforcement and addictive features in rodents: an overview",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Some psychoactive drugs are abused because of their ability to act as reinforcers. As a consequence behavioural patterns (such as drug‐seeking/drug‐taking behaviours) are promoted that ensure further drug consumption. After prolonged drug self‐administration, some individuals lose control over their behaviour so that these drug‐seeking/taking behaviours become compulsive, pervading almost all life activities and precipitating the loss of social compatibility. Thus, the syndrome of addictive behaviour is qualitatively different from controlled drug consumption. Drug‐induced reinforcement can be assessed directly in laboratory animals by either operant or non‐operant self‐administration methods, by classical conditioning‐based paradigms such as conditioned place preference or sign tracking, by facilitation of intracranial electric self‐stimulation, or, alternatively by drug‐induced memory enhancement. In contrast, addiction cannot be modelled in animals, at least as a whole, within the constraints of the laboratory. However, various procedures have been proposed as possible rodent analogues of addiction’s major elements including compulsive drug seeking, relapse, loss of control/impulsivity, and continued drug consumption despite negative consequences. This review provides an extensive overview and a critical evaluation of the methods currently used for studying drug‐induced reinforcement as well as specific features of addictive behaviour. In addition, comic strips that illustrate behavioural methods used in the drug abuse field are provided given for free download under http://www.zi‐mannheim/psychopharmacology.de",

The quantitative and qualitative progression of drug-abuse, the duration of drug-anamnesis, frequent broken-home-situations, grave educational deficiencies together with lacking possibilities of identification, a distinct social decline and chronic conflict-situations indicate the serious degree of the suicidal development.

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

In addition to tics, individuals with tic disorders may present with a broad array of behavioral difficulties including disinhibited speech or conduct, impulsivity, distractibility, motoric hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Leckman and Cohen, 1998). Alternatively, a sizable portion of children and adolescents with tics will be free of coexisting developmental or emotional difficulties.

Aktivitas ini dapat bersifat parsial atau general, berasal dari daerah spesifik korteks serebri atau melibatkan kedua hemisfer otak. Kejang disebabkan oleh banyak faktor, yaitu penyakit serebrovaskuler (stroke iskemik, stroke hemoragik), gangguan neurodegeneratif, tumor, trauma kepala, gangguan metabolik, infeksi susunan saraf pusat (SSP) seperti ensefalitis, meningitis. Penyebab lain adalah gangguan tidur, stimulasi sensori atau emosi, perubahan hormon, kehamilan, penggunaan obat-obatan yang menginduksi kejang (teofilin dosis tinggi, fenotiazin dosis tinggi), antidepresan (maprotilin atau bupropion), kebiasaan minum alkohol. Berdasarkan International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) dan International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) pada tahun 1981, epilepsi adalah suatu kelainan otak yang ditandai adanya faktor predisposisi yang dapat mencetuskan bangkitan epileptik, perubahan neurologis, kognitif, psikologis dan adanya konsekuensi sosial yang diakibatkannya. Diagnosa epilepsi ditegakkan melalui anamnesa, pemeriksaan fisik dan electroencephalography (EEG). Umumnya, epilepsi diterapi dengan obat antiepilepsi atau anti konvulsan. Apabila kejang tidak teratasi dengan obat oral, dapat dilakukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan, berupa non brain epilepsy surgery atau brain epilepsy surgery. Di Inggris, diperkirakan 0,5–2% total penduduk, menderita epilepsi, dimana 13% memerlukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan. Studi retrospektif, membuktikan, pengobatan invasif atau pembedahan pada epilepsi yang tidak respons terhadap obat oral, telah berhasil mengurangi serangan kejang. Penatalaksanaan anestesi pada epilepsi merupakan tantangan tersendiri bagi dokter anestesi. Diperlukan pemilihan gas, anestetika intravena dan teknik anestesi yang tidak memicu serangan kejang selama operasi. Interaksi dan efek samping obat anti epilepsi harus diperhitungkan saat anestesi.

      "abstract": "The term addiction commonly used for drug addiction is uncontrolled use of alcohol, nicotine, opiates, heroine and other psychoactive substances. Apart from this some times it is also used for other compulsions. These unwholesome substances or bad habits are the remote causes for several others diseases. These bad habits are harmful for health but sudden discontinuation of these again produces some discomforts or diseases. These are known as withdrawal symptoms like cravings, irritability, insomnia, depression and anorexia, etc. Instead of withdrawal therapy, Ayurveda mentioned an attractive, logical, replacement therapy. It means unwholesome substances or bad habits should be replaced by good one, which is more constructive. The replacement therapy which should be very systematical and gradual is known as Satmyikarana process in Ayurveda. Satmya means suitability to some things, which are favourable for one’s own self. Satmyam nama yad yadatmanyupaseta (CS Vi-1/20). On the other hand, the substance that is unfavorable for one’s own self is known as Asatmya. Asatmyamiti tadvidyadyanna yati sahatmyatam (CS Sa-1/127). Satmya and Asatmya are also known as Upashaya and Anupashaya, respectively. Hita and pathya are frequently used as synonyms for Satmya and their antonym for Asatmya. Satmyikarana is a procedure of adaptation by gradual and logical giving up of Asatmya substance, on the other hand layer by layer acceptance of Satmya substance. In another word, making foreign substance homologous to body is also known as Satmyikarana. When persons are habituated to any unwholesome substances they feel happy with that. Absence of it creates emptiness or discomfort. Instead of being left blank, filling the blanks with another good one is more constructive. Administration of wholesome substances in this specific way may helps to avoid addictive stimulus and exhibit a healthier way to quench the thirst. It resists the appearance of withdrawal symptoms.",

      "title": "The Strategy of Clinical Procedure for Determining Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol intoxication plays a significant and causal role in various fatal injuries. In comparison to sober individuals, intoxicated people have a greater generic risk for being involved in hazardous activities that may result in fatal injuries. However, it is not clear whether the biological effects of acute alcohol intoxication result in worse injuries than those sustained by sober individuals who are injured by identical mechanisms. Alcohol intoxication has a neuroprotective effect in experimental animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) but the evidence for a similar effect in humans is controversial. Earlier studies found such a protective effect, but more recent large epidemiological studies have not confirmed this finding; some studies also suggest a dose-related protective or exacerbating effect of alcohol intoxication on TBI. There are two apparent alcohol-associated syndromes in which an otherwise survivable blunt force impact to the head of an intoxicated individual is fatal at the scene. The first is a fatal cardiorespiratory arrest (the so-called alcohol concussion syndrome or “commotio medullaris”); the second is “traumatic basilar subarachnoid hemorrhage” (secondary to tears in the cerebral arteries, particularly the intracranial and extracranial vertebral arteries).",

      "abstract": "The acute use of alcohol and several other licit and illicit drugs can affect mental state and cognitive function. The chronic use of certain drugs may also increase the risk of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life. This paper focuses on the long-term cognitive consequences of using alcohol, benzodiazepines, tobacco and cannabis. Currently available evidence indicates that mild to moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and may in fact have a protective effect against dementia, although heavy, long-term consumption is likely to have a negative impact on cognitive function. The degree that alcohol-related cognitive impairment must reach to be classified as dementia is currently obscure. Longer-term smoking is associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and possibly dementia. The chronic use of benzodiazepines has been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment but information relating to dementia remains inconclusive. The chronic use of cannabis may impair intellectual abilities but data on this topic remain sparse and difficult to interpret. In conclusion, there is evidence that some drugs contribute to the causal pathway that leads to the development of cognitive impairment but currently available data do not support the introduction of a separate diagnostic category of drug-induced dementia (such as alcohol-related dementia). Health promotion programs designed to decrease tobacco smoking and \"harmful\" alcohol use (and possibly other drug use) may decrease the burden of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony. Even if it is necessary, to promote a process of disability, whose sentence will be emitted by a judge, who will indicate: the degree of the mentioned disability, the trusteeship regime and who is designated as a legal tutor.",

      "abstract": "The decrease in deaths from the inhalation of toxic fumes may be related to the gradual effect of legislation in some countries on the banning of toxic substances in furnishing items.The continued substantial death rate from carbon monoxide poisoning is disappointing but may be related to the fact that although smoke alarms are more readily found in dwellings, they are often non-functional.The decline in mortality from drug poisoning may be due both to more effective treatment and possibly to the more widespread use of less toxic antidepressant drugs. Accidental poisoningThis is usually a problem of the young child or toddler, with a mean age of presentation of 2.5 years.Accidental poisoning usually occurs when the child is unsupervised, and there is an increased incidence in poisoning following recent disruption in households, such as a new baby, moving house or where there is maternal depression. Intentional overdoseSuicide or parasuicide attempts are usually made by young people in their teens; however, sometimes they may be as young as 8 or 9 years old.These children or adolescents should undergo psychiatric and social assessment. Drug abuseAlcohol and solvent abuse are among the commonest forms of drug abuse in children. Iatrogenic drugsThe commonest offender is diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil).This combination is toxic to some children at therapeutic doses.The most frequently fatal drug is digoxin. Deliberate poisoningRarely, symptoms are induced in children by adults via the administration of drugs.A history of poisoning will often not be given at presentation. F.2 Primary assessment and resuscitation in poisoningz Respiratory rate: the rate may be increased in poisoning from amphetamines, ecstasy, salicylates, ethylene glycol and methanol z Acidotic sighing respirations: this may suggest metabolic acidosis from salicylates or ethylene glycol poisoning as a cause for the coma z Heart rate: tachycardia is caused by amphetamines, ecstasy, β-agonists, phenothiazines, theophylline and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); bradycardia is caused by β-blockers, digoxin and organophosphates z Blood pressure: hypotension is commonly seen in serious poisoning; hypertension is caused by ecstasy and monoamine oxidase inhibitors z If heart rate is above 200 beats/min in an infant or above 150 beats/min in a child, or if the rhythm is abnormal, perform cardiac monitoring.QRS prolongation and ventricular tachycardia are seen in TCA poisoning z Depression of conscious level suggests poisoning with opiates, sedatives (such as benzodiazepines), antihistamines and hypoglycaemic agents z Pupillary size and reaction should be noted.Very small pupils suggest opiate or organophosphate poisoning; large pupils suggest amphetamines, atropine and TCAs 10.",

      "abstract": "Lafora´s disease is a strange type of myoclonic disorder (there have been described no more than 200 cases in the literature), with genetic basis. Some mutations provoke a beginning in the adolescence and a quickly development. At present it doesn’t exist a treatment, none to the disease, but also to the different neurologic associated disorders (myoclonus, seizures, dementia) and fatal outcome. Along the evolution, it´s usual to find psychotic symptoms, especially auditory hallucinations. We present a case with atypical evolution: The subject presents auditory hallucinations, with a good response to psychopharmacological treatment. The presence of these symptoms could be observed in the first years of the diseases. We describe the status of the patient at the admission, the evolution during the stay, with the increase of symptoms in several areas (cognitive, motor, neurologic), and the current status, after hospitalization, where the patient begun receiving enteral nutrition by gastrostomie, due to the limitations to receive the treatment and /or nutrition by oral way. This case is also interesting due to the use of Metformine, an antidiabetic agent, whose use has been suggested as therapeutic alternative for this syndrome.",

      "title": "Leukodystrophy Overview – ARCHIVED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY",
      "abstract": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION IS ARCHIVED. IT IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

The hallucinations may persist for a long time, due to which the clinical picture can be mistaken for a disorder on the schizophrenia spectrum. The prognosis tends to be favourable, although untreated cases are associated with a considerable mortality risk (37% in eight years).A 38-year-old male was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with hallucinations of acute onset during alcohol abuse which persisted for two months of abstinence. The patient experienced visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations during which time his consciousness, attention, orientation and higher cognitive functions remained intact. Somatic and neuroimaging investigations showed no abnormalities. The patient partially recovered on treatment with haloperidol.If hallucinations are experienced during or after a period of alcohol abuse, the diagnosis of alcohol hallucinosis should be considered. The diagnosis must be distinguished from delirium tremens and schizophrenia spectrum disorder as treatment and prognosis are essentially different.",

      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: “Dizziness” is a common complaint that implies a sense of disorientation, usually an altered perception of position in the environment. It may be due to lightheadedness or faintness (eg, the adolescent who has orthostatic hypotension), occur in association with a variety of acute medical disorders (eg, the febrile child who has vomiting and dehydration), or have a psychosomatic origin (eg, depression, anxiety, or exhaustion).Dizziness is formally classified into four categories: vertigo, presyncope, dysequilibrium, and light-headedness. Vertigo is defined as an illusion of movement, most often a sensation of rotation or, less frequently, linear displacement or tilt. Vertigo is the key symptom of vestibular pathology and usually the result of abnormalities of the labyrinth, although it also may be symptomatic of other neurologic disease (eg, seizures or migraines). It typically is accompanied by symptoms of varying degree, including nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration. There is no loss of consciousness.The prevalence of vertigo in children is unknown. A recently published study of Scottish school children reported that 15% had experienced at least one episode of dizziness in a 1-year period. Almost 50% were assessed as having “paroxysmal vertigo” with accompanying symptoms frequently suggestive of migraine (pallor, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia).The etiology of vertigo may be due to abnormalities of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. The labyrinth (the paired organs of equilibrium) consists of three semicircular canals stimulated by angular acceleration and the utricle and saccule stimulated by gravitational forces and vertical acceleration. Impulses pass via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and then ascend in the medial longitudinal fasiculus (to the cranial nerves for eye movement) and descend in the vestibulospinal tracts (excitatory stimuli to the extensor muscles of the head, extremities, and trunk for maintenance of upright posture). The cerebellum receives afferent impulses and functions as a center for integrating oculovestibular and postural responses. Cortical vestibular representation is at the level of the posterior temporal gyrus.Vestibular function is assessed by evaluating the oculovestibular reflex and intensity of nystagmus produced by rotatory and caloric stimulation of the labyrinth. The oculovestibular reflex permits ocular fixation on stationary objects while the head and body are in motion.Nystagmus is the observed movement of the eye in response to stimulation of the labyrinth, retrocochlear vestibular, or central vestibulo-ocular pathway. It is classified as spontaneous or induced by direction and by fatigability. The direction of nystagmus is designated by the fast component (ocular realignment). The slow component represents the oculovestibular response.Vertigo may be due to peripheral vestibular disease or central vestibular dysfunction. When not associated with actual movement, the cause of vertigo is found in the peripheral system in 85% of cases. Use of the term “peripheral” implies that the problem occurs either in the end organ (semicircular canals or utricle) or in the peripheral nerve.The clinical presentations differ and allow for localization of the vertiginous symptomatology (Table 1).The medical history is the initial and most important step in evaluation of the child who complains of dizziness or vertigo. Young children may not have the capacity or vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo, but they can use “playground synonyms” such as spinning, swinging, sliding, or like “a merry-go-round.” The key symptom is a sensation of motion that is either rotatory or linear.The associated aural and neurologic symptoms must be sought carefully. Are there other symptoms of hearing loss (that may fluctuate), fullness, pressure, or ringing? Is there objective evidence of a hearing disorder? If tinnitus or ringing is present, is it continuous, intermittent, or pausitile? Are there symptoms of cortical or brainstem disorders such as headache, visual changes, seizures, or loss of consciousness?The complete physical examination should focus on neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves and cerebellar function (past-pointing and tandem gait). The auditory canal and tympanic membranes must be examined to evaluate for evidence of middle ear infection, malformations, cholesteatoma, or a perilymphatic fistula. A fistula test can be performed in a cooperative child with a pneumatic otoscope or tragal pressure. The child is instructed to look straight ahead, and the eyes are examined while continuous positive and then negative pressure is applied. Normally, there should be no drift of the eyes. In the presence of perilymphatic fistula, the eyes may drift slowly away from the ear with positive pressure and back toward the ear with negative pressure.An important sign is the presence of spontaneous or induced nystagmus. Endpoint or physiologic nystagmus is seen in normal children at a 40-degree deviation of the eyes. Because visual fixation may inhibit mild vestibular nystagmus, otolaryngologists use Frenzel glasses (+10 diopters) both to magnify the eyes and to prevent fixation suppression.Clinical testing in the office or emergency department may provide much information about the child or adolescent who has vertigo. Simple tests of balance include the Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda test (stepping or marching test). The Romberg test evaluates proprioceptive function. A variation of the original examination—the tandem Romberg test—can be performed by having the child place one foot directly in front of the other with the arms either at the sides or crossed in front. Vision is allowed and then excluded. The Unterberger-Fukuda test is performed with the arms placed straight out in front at shoulder height. Vision is excluded, and the child is instructed to maintain the original position and march in place. A total of 50 marching steps should be taken. Normally, patients either will remain in place, step forward up to 50 cms, or turn within approximately 30 degrees of center. Patients who have chronic peripheral vestibular lesions will march slowly toward the side of the lesion.The Hallpike-Dix maneuver should be used during the neurologic examination to elicit paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The child is placed in a sitting position midway on a flat examining table and instructed to look straight ahead at all times. The examiner first turns the head to the side, and the patient then quickly is placed backwards with the head over the end of the table. The response in patients who have a positional vertigo is horizontal rotary nystagmus with the fast phase to the downward ear. The onset of the nystagmus is delayed with typically a 1- to 2-second latency that lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and is associated with a sensation of rotational vertigo. With this positioning maneuver, nystagmus and vertigo occur with the affected ear down. If a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered clinically, the Hallpike-Dix maneuver is not recommended because it may interfere with immediate bedside treatment of this disorder.All patients who have symptoms of vertigo must undergo hearing testing or, in infants, auditory brainstem evoked response testing. Additional pediatric investigations depend on the characteristics of the vertigo and accompanying symptoms in the individual patient. Children who have persistent nonspecific vertigo require a complete blood count, glucose tolerance test, and measurement of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and thyroid function. Certain patients may require testing for sickle cell disease. Patients who have sensorineural hearing loss or neurologic findings should receive computed tomography with thin cuts through the temporal bones, magnetic resonance imaging (± gadolinium), or angiography. If there is a history of associated loss of consciousness, an electroencephalographic study should be obtained.Based on the course of the symptoms, the physical examination, and the results of the previously noted investigations, the child may require referral to an otolaryngologist for additional vestibular testing. Caloric testing is the definitive procedure for identification of vestibular pathology. Electronystagmography is a collection of examinations for the saccadic, optokinetic, and smooth pursuit systems and of nystagmus induced by warming and cooling the labyrinth. These tests are nonspecific and do not provide a diagnosis, but when results are abnormal, they are suggestive of vestibular dysfunction.Other testing used by otolaryngologists in specific circumstances includes rotating chair tests, vestibular autorotation test (physiologic stimuli of high frequency produced by active head oscillations), and posturography (sway movement testing).Acute-onset vertigo or paroxysmal episodes of vertigo can be approached clinically based on the presence or absence of hearing loss (Table 2). If vertigo is continuous and unremitting, assessment can be based on the presence or absence of neurologic abnormalities (Table 3). The diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a history of infection preceding the onset of vertigo and the presence of hearing impairment. The child usually is most comfortable lying on the unaffected side. Any movement causes severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodic symptoms usually subside after several days. This condition is much more frequent in children than had been recognized in the past and often is caused by minor head trauma. There is a sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo from rupture of the round or oval window into the vestibule that results in the creation of a fistula. An abrupt change in barometric pressure (eg, decompression syndrome) also can result in a similar rupture.Menière syndrome is very uncommon in children. Symptoms consist of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, a sensation of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. Recurrent episodes of vertigo and tinnitus are common, with progressive hearing loss after each event.This disorder primarily occurs in adolescents following respiratory infection. Symptoms include vertigo, nausea, and vomiting with postural instability. Episodes are self-limited but tend to recur with decreasing intensity. Diagnosis is made by electronystagmography and thermal caloric testing. Benign paroxysmal vertigo presents initially between 1 and 2 years of age, with symptoms recurring to the age of 4 years. The child presents suddenly with extreme unsteadiness and may be unable to remain upright. Nystagmus may be present, but other symptoms such as vomiting are uncommon. The child is fully conscious throughout the entire episode. Many children develop migraine later in life. The diagnosis is supported by a family history of migraine. Another migraine variant seen in infants is paroxysmal torticollis. A child who has this rare form of migraine will tilt his or her head to one side for several hours (and infrequently for up to several days). There may be associated vomiting. These episodes usually cease by 2 years of age, with many children developing typical migraine headaches by early childhood.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can produce labyrinthine concussion. There is severe vertigo, with unsteadiness and falling toward the affected side. These symptoms may persist, but they gradually diminish in intensity over a 4- to 6-week period.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been described in children as young as 11 years of age. The cause has been determined to be the presence of free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. This type of vertigo has been related to head trauma or vestibular neuronitis. In a proportion of patients, no cause can be found. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is provoked by a change in position and lasts for seconds. Basilar artery migraine presents primarily in adolescent girls with recurrent stereotypic attacks of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. The clinical features can include ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and tinnitus. There are variable bilateral visual complaints. Alternating hemiplegia and paresthesias of the face and limbs can occur, and there can be alteration of consciousness. A severe pounding or pulsatile headache will follow. Vertigo also may be the aura preceding a generalized seizure or present as an actual ictal phenomenon (partial complex seizure). Vestibulogenic seizures are very rare and represent a form of reflex sensory epilepsy (induced by spinning).The treatment of vertigo depends on the duration and discomfort of the symptom and the underlying pathology. Acute vertigo can be treated symptomatically and with reassurance. Antiemetics can be given rectally or intramuscularly. Vestibular sedation or suppressant medication is also useful (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and diazepam). Persistent severe nausea and vomiting may require administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.Most children who have acute vertigo recover spontaneously over a period of several weeks to months. Symptomatic recovery is due to vestibular compensation and central plasticity (reorganization of vestibular circuits). In some children and adolescents, symptoms recur, often in association with physical or psychological stress. Medications producing vestibular sedation should not be prescribed for long-term daily use because they may interfere with the normal compensation process.A specific treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a bedside maneuver (Epley particle repositioning maneuver). This maneuver relocates the free floating debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the vestibule of the labyrinth. Symptomatic relief after a single treatment session is reported in 80% to 90% of patients, although 15% to 30% may have recurrence of symptoms. The maneuver is repeated until nystagmus no longer can be elicited (Figure). A modified version of the Epley maneuver can be taught to patients with instructions to perform the activity three times a day until there are no symptoms of positional vertigo for 24 hours.Chronic or recurrent vertigo is often resistant to treatment, but it may respond to a course of clonazepam or carbamazepine. Exercise regimens also have been prescribed, with balance and gait training during dynamic tasks that precipitate the patient’s symptoms. These exercises are practiced until an asymptomatic state is reached. Management of accompanying psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, depression) depends on the nature of the associated symptom.Surgical procedures for the treatment of vertigo rarely are required in childhood. Endolymphatic arachnoid shunt operations are successful in 65% of patients who have Menière disease. Disabling vertigo due to vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disorders may require vestibular nerve section. Surgery is an option for patients who have severe intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using procedures to disable the posterior semicircular canal.Appropriate management of vertigo depends on determination of the etiology and carefully tailored treatment plans specific to the vestibular or central disorder producing the vertigo.",

      "title": "Drug-induced cognitive impairment: Effect of cardiovascular agents",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Cardiovascular agents can be associated with a negative effect on cognition, especially in older adults, critically ill people, and those with baseline cognitive impairment. Negative effect on cognition is commonly reported as uncomplicated acute confusion and delirium and, less commonly, chronic cognitive changes due to drug-induced depression and/or dementia. Methods: A literature review of case reports, case series, prospective cohort studies, clinical trials, and literature reviews were included in this study. Articles were located using online databases PubMed and Medline using the following keywords: antiarrhythmic agents, anticholinergic burden, antihypertensive agents, beta-blockers, cardiovascular agents, cognitive impairment, delirium, cognition, dementia, depression, digoxin, diuretics, and drug-induced cognitive impairment. Results: In general, use of all antihypertensives, especially in the case of polypharmacy or inappropriate dosing, can lead to hypotension and/or bradycardia, and thus lead to mental/cognitive status change due to decreased cerebral perfusion. Use of diuretics can be associated with fluid/electrolyte and/or acid-base imbalance, resulting in the onset of confusion and delirium. In addition, cardiovascular agents with central bioavailability, such digoxin and select antiarrhythmics, and antihypertensives may carry a risk for cognitive impairment due to various mechanisms proposed, such as antagonism of central muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, neurotransmission imbalance in the brain, and disruption of physiologic function of sodium/potassium ATPase in the neuronal cells. Discussion: When dealing with an individual who presents with acute, subacute, and chronic changes in cognitive function, one should perform a thorough medication history as the first step in order to aid in the identification of drug-induced cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

      "abstract": "The following case study illustrates the clinical role of mental health professionals who specialize in the treatment of people with diabetes. This case describes the diagnostic dilemma presented by a patient with diabetes and a history of severe hypoglycemia complicated by other medical, psychiatric, social, and functional problems.\n\nCognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, increased distractibility, and confusion) can present a difficult diagnostic problem for clinicians because it can be symptomatic of many underlying and undetected clinical conditions. Careful diagnosis is crucial because some causes may be progressive and irreversible, whereas other causes may be reversible with medical or psychiatric treatment. Some of the more noteworthy causes are related to medication, alcohol, aging, depression, and, as in this case study, the possible consequences of recurrent severe hypoglycemia related to diabetes.1 Diabetes, of course, may cause an increase in cognitive decline over the course of time because of vascular risk factors.2 Some evidence suggests that acute hyperglycemia may have a negative impact on cognitive performance.3\n\nDepression is the most common of the reversible causes of memory impairment, and people with diabetes are twice as likely to suffer from depression as those without diabetes.4 Recent evidence suggests that diabetes may create alterations in regions of the brain that are associated with affect regulation and increase the risk for developing a depressive disorder.5 Fortunately, problematic medications can be modified, and alcohol misuse or depression can be treated. Unfortunately, despite its relevance to the course of diabetes, depression is recognized and treated in fewer than one-third of people with diabetes.4\n\nThe relationship between recurrent severe hypoglycemia and cognitive impairment remains unclear.

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

Biological diagnosis of insulinomas Plasma glucose concentrationsSince the clinical symptoms lack diagnostic specificity, measurement of plasma concentration of glucose is mandatory (ideally at the time of occurrence of clinical symptoms) and must be performed in venous blood samples with a reliable laboratory method.In order to avoid pseudohypoglycaemia, i.e. a consequence of glucose metabolism by blood cells in the tube containing the blood sample, the blood sample should be collected in a tube with a glycolysis inhibitor (NaF).Glucose concentrations are measured using reference method with hexokinase.",

Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased health-care costs, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline are well-recognized outcomes of delirium. Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%. Many of the clinical features and symptoms of delirium can also be associated with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, psychosis, and dementia.",

      "title": "Adicción a cannabis: bases neurobiológicas y consecuencias médicas",
      "abstract": "espanolLa adiccion a los preparados de cannabis sativa es un problema relevante en nuestra sociedad, con especial importancia durante la adolescencia. Su facil disponibilidad y los episodios adversos asociados a su abuso y/o dependencia han incrementado la demanda de tratamiento derivada por su consumo. En los ultimos 20 anos se ha podido avanzar mucho sobre la farmacologia del cannabis y de sus principios activos, moleculas grasas que actuan a traves de un sistema de senalizacion endogeno denominado sistema endocannabinoide implicado en el desarrollo y la plasticidad cerebrales. Su estimulacion cronica puede inducir no solo dependencia y adiccion, sino tambien derivar en consecuencias neurobiologicas que tienen repercusion clinica. Asi, por un lado se puede encontrar el incremento de trastornos mentales tanto primarios como inducidos (trastornos del estado de animo, trastornos de ansiedad y trastornos psicoticos) y por el otro, alteraciones en los procesos cognitivos (memoria, atencion, toma de decisiones, asuncion de riesgos, control de impulsos). Estas consecuencias son mas graves si el consumo se realiza en la adolescencia. Algunos de estos efectos son permanentes y el conocimiento de los mismos necesario para una correcta atencion sanitaria. EnglishAddiction to products derived from the plant cannabis sativa has become a relevant problem in western societies. Its prevalence in both teenagers and young adults has grown in the last decade. The problem is aggravated by the availability of plant derivatives with a high THC content. Today, the number of cannabis users requesting medical treatment is growing, as well as the incidence and variety of the adverse effects associated with its chronic consumption. On the other hand, the last 20 years� research have revealed the hidden pharmacology of the active principles of cannabis. Cannabinoids, the psychoactive chemicals of the plant, exert their pharmacological actions through their interaction with an endogenous signaling system, the endocannabinoid system. This system is involved in brain development, plasticity and repair, and its chronic stimulation can induce not only dependence/addiction, but also result in adverse clinical effects. The negative side of cannabis use has greatest impact in the adolescent period. The main adverse effects of chronic cannabis use include the increase in the incidence of mental disorders (mainly psychosis), as well as alterations in cognitive processes including memory, attention, decision-making, risk behaviors as well as impulsivity. Some of these effects are permanent and information and research on their nature is greatly needed in order to achieve a correct public health approach to cannabis use.",

The distribution of different causes may reflect the geographic location of the hospital. The most common substances used for self-inflicted death by poisoning are tricyclic antidepressants, salicylates (particularly children), and street drugs. In the elderly, suicide attempts and unintentional intoxication through misjudgment of dose remain the leading causes. Overdose and acute brain injury may go together. Patients with traumatic brain injury may have been intoxicated or overdosed and some strokes are seen after use of illicit drugs. It is important to assess the severity of the intoxication, but also the management of the patient particularly when there are recurrent seizures or permanent unexplained unconsciousness. The neurointensivist should have a good working knowledge of the pharmacodynamics of ingested or injected drugs in large quantities and how to interpret neuroimaging.",

Cocaine-induced excited delirium refers to fatal cocaine intoxication with the following symptoms occurring sequentially: hyperthermia, delirium with agitation, respiratory arrest, and death. We present a case of cocaine-induced excited delirium in a cocaine \"body packer\" or a \"mule\", specifically an individual who attempts to smuggle cocaine within the body. Investigators at the scene initially suspected homicide due to the victim's sharp and blunt force injuries. Three rubber packets containing cocaine were removed from the victim's rectum. Blood toxicological analysis revealed an alcohol concentration of 0.016 g/100 and cocaine >1 mg/L. The forensic pathologist should consider cocaine-induced excited delirium when an individual exhibits aggressive behavior, unexpected strength, and resistance to pain who dies suddenly. Further analysis should be performed during the scene investigation and autopsy for evidence of body packing.",

The meaning of the symptom is essential: it may reveal a crisis related to his developmental phase, antecedent infantile disease or the offset of adult disease. Secondly, at this age, the prescription of drugs rises questions about pharmacokinetics, possible side-effects, expected therapeutic effects and the way the prescription is experienced psychologically. Neuroleptics, which may be necessary in spite of their side-effects, should be restricted to psychotic conditions. Antidepressants, lithium, tranquilizers are also discussed with respect to their usefulness, risks and indications.

Gangguan tidur dapat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup pada orangtua, menurunkan status imunologi, gangguan hormonal dan endokrinologi, serta penurunan fungsi kognitif. Manajemen untuk gangguan tidur ini meliputi terapi non-farmakologis dan farmakologis. Perubahan perilaku dan modifikasi diet pada beberapa penyebab gangguan tidur terbukti efektif. Intervensi non-farmakologis seperti &lt;em&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/em&gt; dan terapi perilaku kognitif merupakan terapi lini pertama pada berbagai gangguan tidur.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

Hastalığın erken aşamaları klasik olarak bellekteki zayıflama ile ilişkilidir. Hastalığın erken evresinde bireyler kelime bulmakta, yeni insanların isimlerini hatırlamakta ve sosyal/iş görevlerinde zorluk yaşamaktadırlar. Beraberinde son günlerde okuduğu yazıyı unutma ve nesneleri yanlış yerleştirme gibi sorunlar görülebilmektedir.

Dans la tres grande majorite des cas, il s’agit d’une baisse de l’activite sexuelle, qui peut affecter, isolement ou en association, le desir et l’interet sexuels, l’excitation ou l’orgasme. Ces troubles s’observent majoritairement dans les epilepsies partielles, particulierement les epilepsies temporales, mais peuvent concerner aussi les sujets presentant une epilepsie generalisee idiopathique.

Chronic and excessive alcohol consumption results in cognitive disorders partially reversible with abstinence. These heterogeneous cognitive impairments affect executive functions, episodic memory and social cognition. They may interfere with the motivational process to abandon excessive drinking behavior, impair patients' ability to benefit from treatment and increase the risk of relapse. Alcohol-related neuropsychological deficits should thus be evaluated and considered for personalized alcohol treatment. Several screening tools available in clinical settings enable clinicians to detect patients with cognitive impairments and to offer them appropriate and adjusted treatment.Repérage des troubles cognitifs liés à l’alcool. La consommation chronique et excessive d’alcool est fréquemment associée à des troubles cognitifs, en partie réversibles à l’arrêt de l’alcool. Variables d’un individu à l’autre, ils touchent principalement les fonctions exécutives et motrices, la mémoire épisodique, ainsi que la cognition sociale. Ces troubles peuvent freiner le processus motivationnel, amoindrir les capacités des patients à bénéficier des prises en charge et augmenter le risque de rechute. Plusieurs outils de dépistage rapide sont disponibles en pratique clinique. Ils permettent d’orienter les patients ayant une altération cognitive vers des prises en charge spécialisées pour la réalisation de bilans complémentaires.

      "title": "The effects of prolonged endurance exercise on the neurological system in horses",
      "abstract": "Horses compete routinely in endurance-type activities. Many of the various pathophysiological mechanisms which arise during endurance exercise have implications for the health and function of the neurological system. The development of centrally-mediated fatigue is a normal homeostatic physiological event with several possible mechanisms. Development of pathophysiological phenomena such as cerebral oedema may be near-terminal events during or after endurance exhaustion. Cellular damage resulting in cytotoxic cerebral oedema may result from decreases in circulating blood volume (dehydration), blood pressure, oxygen, and glucose, or increases in brain temperature. Vasogenic cerebral oedema arises from changes in cerebral vascular perfusion, tone, and permeability. Increased vascular permeability results from increased brain temperature, poor vascular integrity due to severe dehydration, disseminated intravascular coagulation due to hemoconcentration or endotoxemia, and iatrogenic overhydration during therapy. Clinical signs of intracranial disease after endurance exercise include staggering, shaking, ataxia, paresis, poor tongue tone, facial twitching, collapse, recumbency, seizures, and death. Treatment should include active and aggressive cooling, intravenous polyionic fluids, acid-base imbalance correction, intravenous glucose and calcium supplementation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents once the patient is better hydrated, intra-nasal oxygen therapy if practicable, and achievement of a non-dependent head posture to prevent jugular venous hypertension and further increases in intracranial pressure. The prognosis for central fatigue is good with appropriate supportive care, but the prognosis for successful treatment of cerebral oedema must be considered guarded at best. Prevention is critical and must be through incorporation of mandatory rest stops with sufficient length and veterinary monitoring to allow prevention and detection of exhaustion, excessive dehydration, and neurological signs. Management flexibility in shortening or postponing rides in hot and humid conditions, mandated use of aggressive cooling techniques, and more restrictive entry criteria for upper level Fédération Equestre Internationale races should all be considered as viable options for optimising the safety of endurance horses.",

The symptoms or deficits are related to psychological factors but not intentionally produced or feigned. They could be associated with true neurological disorders and their diagnosis is difficult. Neurologically they do not conform to known neurological mechanisms but instead follow the individual conceptualization of a condition and vary according to attention and emotions. Psychologically they are related to a psychic conflict or a stressful event. They could be associated to other manifestations of the hysterical neurosis or various mental conditions.",

      "title": "Alcoholism and general drug abuse",
      "abstract": "The emotional structure of the alcoholic makes him a prime candidate for drug use and abuse. Some of these drugs are used initially by the classic alcoholic, with medical supervision, for the purpose of making him socially acceptable. The amphetamines, barbiturates, and tranquilizers are among the most common prescription drugs used. Much the same as the alcoholic has difficulty in measuring or monitoring his alcoholic intake, he has difficulty controlling his capsule-pill schedule. The absorption of any drug when taken in combination with alcohol is unpredictable, but usually accelerated. Effect on judgement and motor performance is also unpredictable, but always to a negative degree. Since many of these drugs are useful in the medical management of the alcoholic, the physician is confronted with a therapeutic paradox. Medications which are intended to tranquilize the patient may very well decrease motor performance and judgement. Drugs that make it easier for an alcoholic not to drink may, in terms of motor performance mimic his conduct while drinking. Sensory input and analysis in judgement formation are also influenced. Awareness of this interplay of clinical and toxic effects places the physician in an active role in accident prevention.",

      "title": "Alteraciones estructurales de las regiones cerebrales sexuales tras empleo de paroxetina versus agomelatina",
      "abstract": "El estado de animo del individuo es un tono vital interno dominante y mantenido, que influye en el comportamiento de la persona y en su percepcion del mundo. Este puede verse normal o eutimico, elevado o hipertimico; bajo o deprimido. Las alteraciones de la esfera afectiva son un grupo de afecciones clinicas que se caracterizan por la perdida de ese sentido del control y por el sentimiento subjetivo de un gran malestar. (SINTOMAS) Los pacientes con animo deprimido experimentan una perdida de energia y del interes, sentimientos de culpa, dificultades de concentracion, perdida del apetito, pensamientos de muerte… entre otros sintomas. Los trastornos del espectro depresivo, cuentan actualmente con una extensa farmacopea, centrados fundamentalmente por los psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos. Tanto el propio deterioro animico asi como su tratamiento pueden traer consigo un sintoma adicional, la disfuncion sexual (DS). Los Inhibidores Selectivos de Recaptacion de Serotonina (ISRS) provocan una amplia variedad de DS, desde las mas habituales como descenso en la libido, disminucion de la excitacion y retardo en el orgasmo, a otras mas anecdoticas como priapismo (en pene y clitoris), anestesia genital, anestesia peneana, ereccion, orgasmos y eyaculacion espontaneos, aumento de la libido, orgasmos dolorosos… (F. Arias et al, 2000). A pesar de todo, en las fichas tecnicas, la incidencia de la disfuncion sexual se establece entre 2-16%, muy inferior a la estimada en la practica real (Montejo AL, 2001). A modo de resumen, podemos concluir que existe bibliografia que justifica la DS provocada por los antidepresivos (concretamente los ISRS) en seres humanos, no obstante con las limitaciones: 1) Los pacientes con Trastorno del espectro depresivo pueden presentar en si mismo DS como sintoma de la enfermedad. 2) Los pacientes pueden presentar comorbilidad que de lugar a DS. 3) La infraestimacion de la DS debido a la dificultad que supone recoger en una historia clinica reglada la sexualidad como ritmo biologico esencial. Es por eso que creemos que es esencial dar un paso mas y buscar a nivel biologico, que es lo que se modifica a nivel estructural en la esfera, tras el empleo de psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos, concretamente comparando un ISRS con un antidepresivo melatoninergico. Para ello creemos que es una herramienta muy util el estudio anatomopatologico del Sistema Nervioso Central de animales de experimentacion. Trabajando sobre las areas cerebrales implicadas en la sexualidad. Nuestra hipotesis de trabajo se basa en que la Paroxetina produce disfuncion sexual y la Agomelatina no, por tanto las regiones cerebrales estudiadas en los animales a los que se les administro Paroxetina mostraran diferencias con respecto a los animales a los que se les administro Agomelatina. La descripcion de dichas diferencias podria dar lugar a las bases que expliquen de forma estructural la disfuncion sexual producida por un ISRS. Para la realizacion de nuestro trabajo hemos utilizado como animal de experimentacion un total de 20 ratas de la raza Wistar que al inicio del tratamiento tenian aproximadamente 50 dias (postpuberales); y un peso aproximado de 150 gr. Esta camada de ratas se divide en 4 grupos: dos experimentales y dos controles. 1) Animales del Grupo control 1 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. No se administra ninguna sustancia. 2) Animales del Grupo control 2 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. Se admInistra HMC. 3) Animales del Grupo experimental 1 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Paroxetina. 4) Animales del Grupo experimental 2 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Agomelatina. A todos los animales se les expuso a un ciclo de luz-oscuridad de 12 horas a traves de un punto de luz y un temporizador y se les administro las sustancias correspondientes a lo largo de 28 dias naturales. Se realizo un pesaje de los animales en tres momentos del estudio: al inicio, en el dia 14 y en el dia 28. Pesamos la jaula con animales y sin animales, hallamos la diferencia y hacemos un promedio del peso. A lo largo de los 28 dias se realiza un diario de conducta: conductas extranas, psicomotricidad, subida en patas traseras, olfateo general, olfateo anal, intromisiones, etc. Tras 28 dias de administracion de las sustancias; se procede al sacrificio e inclusion de muestras. Tincion mediante la tecnica inmunohistoquimica con los anticuerpos murinos: • Anticuerpo Tiroxina-Hidroxilasa (TH): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Receptor alfa de Estrogenos (RE-a): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Oxitocina (OXT): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/500 RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION (DIARIO DE CONDUCTA) En el grupo de las ratas a las que se les administro Paroxetina se produjo un importante incremento de peso en comparacion con el grupo al que se le administro Agomelatina. Las primeras doblaron su peso y las segundas experimentaron un incremento del 40% del peso corporal aproximadamente. Estos cambios de peso dieron lugar al reajuste de dosis. En el grupo de Paroxetina llamaba la atencion el intenso apetito que mostraban a partir del dia 10 del estudio. En comparacion con los otros grupos de estudio mostraban una importante voracidad. Ademas mostraban un incremento de la actividad motora que se mostraba en subidas sobre patas traseras y olfateo general. A pesar de todo esto era un grupo de ratas muy colaboradoras, que no mostraban resistencia ni a ser manipuladas ni a la administracion del farmaco. Respecto al grupo de Agomelatina mantenian un apetito estable. La psicomotricidad solo se veia incrementada en el momento de la manipulacion, que comenzaban a dar vueltas alrededor de la jaula. Se mostraban parcialmente colaboradoras a la manipulacion y a la administracion del farmaco, con una conducta ambivalente e imprevisible, en ningun momento agresiva. Los grupos control mantuvieron un apetito estable, no sufrieron incremento ni descenso de peso. Respecto a la psicomotricidad no hay hallazgos destacables. RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION A MICROSCOPIO OPTICO .-Sistema dopaminergico: descenso marcado y global en todo el sistema dopaminergicos (desde origenes hasta destinos) en los animales tratadados con Paroxetina comparado con los animales tratados con Agomelatina y los animales control; que fue objetivado mediante el tratamiento estadistico de los datos obtenidos a traves del programa de procesamiento digital ImageJ. .-Sistema oxcitocinergico: no se observan diferencias significativas entre los grupos de estudio .-Sistema receptor alfa de estrogeno: se observa descenso de RE alfa en la pars tuberalis de los animales tratados con Agomelatina.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by complaints of a strong desire to move legs during periods of rest or inactivity, which is relieved by movement (most pronounced in the evening or at night). Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью. Имеется много сообщений о лекарственно-индуцированном СБН (ЛИСБН), который наиболее часто вызывают антипсихотические средства, антидепрессанты и противоэпилептические препараты. К факторам риска развития ЛИСБН относят пожилой возраст, курение, злоупотребление кофеином и алкоголем, заболевания желудочно-кишечного тракта, высокие дозы препаратов, одновременное применение двух препаратов и более. Механизм развития ЛИСБН связывается с действием лекарственных средств на различные рецепторы и нейромедиаторные системы, особенно дофаминергические. Лечение ЛИСБН предполагает прежде всего отмену лекарственного средства или, если она невозможна, снижение его дозы. Профилактика ЛИСБН основывается на соблюдении принципов рациональной фармакотерапии.",

They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

      "abstract": "Der Beitrag behandelt detailliert die Problematik des Verschuldens beziehungsweise fahrlaessigen Verhaltens bei Fahruntuechtigkeit des Lenkers infolge der Einwirkung von Medikamenten oder infolge der Medikamenteneinnahme im Zusammenwirken mit Alkoholgenuss. Einleitend wird auf die Sorgfaltspflicht eines Lenkers verwiesen. Jeder Kraftfahrer hat sich vor der Inbetriebnahme eines Fahrzeuges stets zu vergewissern, dass er nach seinen koerperlichen und geistigen Faehigkeiten dazu (noch) imstande ist, den Anforderungen des Strassenverkehrs zu genuegen. Wirkungen oder Nebenwirkungen von Medikamenten koennen eine Reihe von physischen oder psychischen Stoerungen verursachen, welche die Verkehrstauglichkeit herabsetzen. Als verkehrsmedizinisch relevant muessen alle Pharmaka gelten, die einen zentralen Angriffspunkt haben. Die Wirkungen der in Betracht kommenden Medikamente haengen jedoch von verschiedensten Faktoren und der individuellen Situation des Betroffenen ab. Prinzipiell ist zu sagen, dass eine medikamentenbedingte Fahruntuechtigkeit ein normatives Tatbestandsmerkmal ist, dem ein vorsaetzliches oder fahrlaessiges Verhalten zugrunde liegen kann. Die rechtliche Entscheidung ueber die Verschuldensfrage und die Schuldform haengt davon ab, ob und gegebenenfalls wie der betroffene Lenker vor oder waehrend der Fahrt die Wirkung der konsumierten Medikamente im Hinblick auf seine Fahrsicherheit beurteilt hat und beurteilen musste. Da jeder Fahrzeuglenker vor Antritt der Fahrt verpflichtet ist, seine Fahrtuechtigkeit zu pruefen, handelt er im Falle einer mangelnden eigenen Vorsorge fahrlaessig. Auf die verschiedenen Moeglichkeiten eines Kraftfahrers, eine Fahruntuechtigkeit vorauszusehen, wird eingegangen. Ein Kraftfahrer, der sich gegen aerztlichen Rat nach Einnahme eines Medikamentes ans Steuer setzt, handelt schuldhaft. Der Autor geht weiters auf Arzneimittelinteraktionen bei Einnahme von 2 oder mehreren Medikamenten gleichzeitig, auf das Zusammenwirken von Medikamenten und Alkohol sowie auf alkoholhaltige Medikamente und die im jeweiligen Fall zu erfuellenden Sorgfaltspflichten des Lenkers ein.

Su evolucion natural sin tratamiento puede derivar en serias repercusiones negativas en el funcionamiento academico, social y familiar de los ninos, interfiriendo de forma importante en el desarrollo. Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

      "title": "Neglect",
      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

Delirium is an acute mental status change that is characterized by a disorder of attention and cognitive function that is typically a consequence of a medical condition. Despite differences in terminology, there are many other reasons that delirium is insufficiently diagnosed, and this is more pronounced in older adults. Coexisting dementia combined with lack of understanding of baseline mental status by healthcare providers may lead to assumptions that symptoms related to delirium are normal. Delirium is commonly missed in clinical practice, and so familiarity of the key features is extremely important. Patients with delirium may have lethargy or decreased arousal, while others may be hyperalert or hypervigilant. Medications are a leading cause of delirium, especially in older adults. Older patients are often on multiple medications and are typically more at risk for adverse effects from medications.",

TBI-related cognitive impairment is common in veterans who have served in recent conflicts in the Middle East and is often related to blasts from improvised explosive devices. Although neurobehavioral disorders such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder commonly occur after combat, the presentation of such disorders in those with head injury may pass undetected with use of current diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological instruments. With a multidimensional approach (such as the biopsychosocial model) applied to each symptom cluster, psychological, occupational, and social dysfunction can be delineated and managed.",

These disturbances are associated with considerable morbidity including earlier nursing home admission, more rapid progression, exacerbation of functional and cognitive deficits, and increased caregiver distress. When attention to social or environmental causes, medical conditions, or other triggers of the behavioral disturbance fails to yield improvement, a role for medication may be indicated, whereby the most dominant behavioral target symptoms are matched to the most relevant medication class. Evidence is reviewed for various medication classes in treating agitation in the patient with Alzheimer's disease, and future treatment strategies may be aimed at delaying or preventing such neuropsychiatric disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Stimulant drugs such as amphetamine, nicotine and Ecstasy/MDMA, are taken for positive reasons such as mood enhancement. Yet their repetitive use can lead to a range of psychobiological deficits and psychiatric distress. There are several underlying neurobiological factors for this. Their acute subjective effects are typically positive, with greater alertnessand emotional engagement. However during the post-drug recovery period the opposite states predominate, with feeling of tiredness and sadness. Every recreational central nervous system (CNS) stimulant drug causes this mood fluctuation. They are most evident in drugs with a very rapid onset and come-down, such as cocaine or nicotine. Hence regular smokers report good moods immediately after smoke inhalation, followed by poor moods 30-60 minutes later. This rapidity of these mood changes with nicotine and cocaine, helps explain why they are also the most addictive. Parallel fluctuations occur across many other psychological functions, with impoverished cognitive skills when off-drug. CNS stimulant drugs also adversely affect the HPA axis, impairing sleep and disrupting homeostasis. These core psychobiological problems help explain their adverse psychiatric effects, since fluctuating mood states and disrupted homeostatic stability, can exacerbate any prior psychiatric susceptibilities (for anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, or other disorders). In summary, the repetitive stimulation of the CNS by recreational drugs can be very damaging to the organism, both acutely and chronically.",

The victim then loses consciousness within a short period of time after drinking a spiked beverage or food.

      "abstract": "L'impulsivité chez le patient atteint de troubles psychotiques se manifeste par une multitude de comportements pouvant avoir un impact majeur sur l'évolution et le traitement de la maladie ainsi que sur le fonctionnement occupationnel et social. Différentes hypothèses expliquant les comportements impulsifs et leurs conséquences pour le patient et son entourage seront explorées. Des approches thérapeutiques sont identifiées afin d'améliorer la prise en charge des patients avec des troubles psychotiques présentant des comportements impulsifs et subséquemment, de diminuer l'impact des conséquences de l'impulsivité. L'impulsivité chez les personnes souffrant de psychose a été peu traitée dans la littérature avant les années 2000. Plusieurs hypothèses peuvent expliquer cette absence, dont la difficulté de distinguer l'impulsivité de l'agressivité ou que celle-ci ait été surtout attribuée aux comorbidités des individus atteints de psychose. Dans la dernière décennie, les recherches portant sur ce sujet ont exploré majoritairement les causes de l’impulsivité (souvent mesurée en laboratoire) et ce, en lien avec des modèles théoriques. Peu d’études cliniques se sont penchées sur le traitement de l’impulsivité, malgré les manifestations cliniques fréquentes de l'impulsivité par des comportements ou des actes mentaux bien précis chez la clientèle présentant des troubles psychotiques. Pourtant, il est primordial de s'y attarder puisque l'impulsivité peut engendrer de lourdes conséquences dont un risque accru d’agressivité et de violence (Barratt, 1991; Barratt &amp; Felthous, 2003; Quanbeck et al., 2007; Volavka &amp; Citrome, 2008) ainsi que de comportements suicidaires (Mann,Waternaux, Haas, &amp; Malone, 1999; Gut-Fayand et al., 2001; Iancu et al., 2010). De plus, elle jouerait un rôle majeur dans le développement et la persistance des troubles de toxicomanie comorbides (Bickel, Odum &amp; Madden, 1999; Dervaux et al., 2001; Krishnan-Sarin et al., 2007) compliquant ainsi le traitement chez les individus atteints de psychose. Malgré l'absence de consensus sur sa définition, l’impulsivité est généralement exprimée par une conduite ou une réaction (à des stimuli internes ou externes) rapide, spontanée, excessive, non planifiée, potentiellement mal adaptée et pouvant être dangereuse qui ne tient pas compte des possibles conséquences négatives pour soi ou autrui (Enticott, 2006; Moeller, Barratt, Dougherty, Schmitz, &amp; Swann, 2001). Par exemple, l’impulsivité se manifeste lorsqu’une personne fournit une réponse avant que la fin de la question ne lui soit complètement posée; lorsqu’une personne manifeste un acte violent sérieux non planifié ; lorsqu’une personne présente sa démission au travail sans penser aux conséquences de cette décision ou lorsqu’une personne rompt son bail de logement pour emménager rapidement avec un nouveau conjoint qu’elle ne connaît que depuis une semaine. Les individus atteints de schizophrénie seraient plus impulsifs comparativement à la population générale (Dursun, Szemis, Andrews, Whitaker, &amp; Reveley, 2000; Enticott, Ogloff, &amp; Bradshaw, 2008; Kaladjian, Jeanningros, Azorin, Anton, &amp; Mazzola-Pomietto, 2011) et certains suggèrent même que l’impulsivité serait un concept central (‘core feature’) de la schizophrénie (Heerey, Robinson, McMahon, &amp; Gold, 2007; Kester et al., 2006).",

Patients with addiction display an inability to consistently abstain from using the drug, impairment in behavioral control, cravings for the drug with negative affective states when access to drug is denied, and diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual disinhibition is uncommon in patients with schizophrenia and are included within the behavioral disorders along with others such as agitation, aggression, sleep disorders and circadian rhythm, due to multiple reasons: isolation, rejection, difficulty in personal relationships. Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

In the course of a test program for medicinal therapy of this syndrome we studied the efficacy of a vincamine containing formulation (Pervincamin forte retard or Pervincamin ampoules, respectively) on the symptoms of a chronical brain disturbance. The study was randomised double-blind. We found that under the influence of the vincamine formulation the subjective symptoms, such as lack of interest, apathy, aggressiveness, raging, psychomotoric retardation, lack of concentration, dysmnesia, decreased with a statistical significance (p less than or equal to 0.05). Also the subjective symptoms, reported by the patients, such as tinnitus and vertigo decreased significantly under the treatment with the vincamine preparation. Therefore some of the parameters important for resocialisation and revitalisation of old patients could be influenced in a favourable way. Basing on the good results of our investigations, the treatment of psychiatric disturbances in old patients with vincamine containing drugs seems to be justified.",

Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis). These patients may need special supportive care (e.g., inpatient detoxification or long-term residential treatment).",

Data are presented and reviewed that suggest that the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms progressively increases over years of alcohol abuse in a stepwise fashion similar to the kindling process. The model is presented that the limbic system hyperirritability which accompanies each alcohol withdrawal serves over time to kindle increasingly widespread subcortical structures. These long-term changes in neuronal excitability might relate to the progression of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from tremor to seizures and delirium tremens, as well as the alcoholic personality changes between episodes of withdrawal.",

This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "title": "Chronic dizziness and instability as adverse effects explained by drug-induced vestibulotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect. Keywords: chronic dizziness; chronic instability; ototoxicity; vestibulotoxicity; dynamic posturography.

No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW.

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

In recent years, psychedelics such as psilocybin have also shown considerable promise as therapeutic agents when combined with talk therapy, for example, in the treatment of major depression or substance use disorder.2 However, it is currently unclear whether the aforementioned acute subjective effects are necessary to bring about the observed therapeutic effects of psilocybin and other psychedelics. This uncertainty has sparked a lively-though still largely hypothetical-debate on whether psychedelics without subjective effects (\"nonsubjective psychedelics\" or \"non-hallucinogenic psychedelics\") could still have the same therapeutic impact, or whether the acute subjective effects are in fact necessary for this impact to be fully realized.3,4,5.",

      "title": "A Triphasic Metacognitive Formulation of Problem Drinking",
      "abstract": "In this paper, a triphasic metacognitive formulation of problem drinking and its implications for treatment are presented together with a summary of the evidence consistent with this approach. In the triphasic formulation during the pre‐alcohol use phase, alcohol‐related triggers, in the form of cravings, images, memories or thoughts, activate positive metacognitive beliefs about extended thinking, which lead to desire thinking, rumination and worry or their combination. The activation of the latter brings to an escalation of cravings and negative affect, strengthening negative metacognitive beliefs about the need to control thoughts and enhancing the likelihood of alcohol use. In the alcohol use phase, positive metacognitive beliefs about alcohol use and a reduction in metacognitive monitoring contribute to dysregulation in alcohol use. Over the course of time and as the drinking problem escalates in severity, negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability of alcohol use and alcohol‐related thoughts emerge, contributing to the perseveration of dysregulated alcohol use. In the post‐alcohol use phase following the activation of positive metacognitive beliefs about post‐event rumination, the affective, cognitive and physiological consequences of dysregulated alcohol use become the subject of rumination. This, in turn, leads to a paradoxical increase in negative affect and alcohol‐related thoughts, together with the strengthening of negative metacognitive beliefs about such thoughts. Intermittent attempts to suppress alcohol‐related thoughts increase the likelihood of returning to use alcohol as a means of achieving self‐regulation. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

Addiction or psychological dependence implies the compulsive self-administration of the drug, caused by both its reinforcing or rewarding effects and the unpleasant experience (i.e., abstinence syndrome) produced by the sudden interruption of its consumption. In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use.

      "title": "[Motivational processes in addiction: the role of craving, salience and attention].",
      "abstract": "Motivational processes play an important role in addictive behaviours. Craving is mainly an explicit or conscious process that can motivate individuals to continue alcohol, take drugs or smoke cigarettes. Craving also plays a role in relapse; self-reported craving has often been associated with relapse. However, craving cannot explain all addictive behaviours. In addition to craving, implicit cognitive processes play an important part in motivating individuals to become involved in substance use.To describe some of these implicit cognitive processes, namely the role of salience, attention bias, automatic memory associations and action tendencies.A description is given of recent research results and the implications of these implicit processes for clinical practice.Oversensitive/hypersensitive motivational processes and a lack of control over these processes both play an important role in addiction. This can be expressed by an uncontrollable urge to inject the drug or substance again, in spite of the fact that it is unwise for the person in question to do so. Recent research has shown that there are various very promising methods for dealing with these two problems (oversensitive/hypersensitive motivational processes and a lack of control over these processes), either separately or together. The methods involve behavioural training programmes, medication and neural stimulation.The research results are very promising, but more research is needed.",

Descripción del caso: Masculino de 57 años, con historia de síntomas afectivos, quien ingreso a urgencias diagnosticado con episodio depresivo mayor de características catatónicas, el cual mejoró con el inicio de midazolam y luego titulación de Lorazepam. Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona.

      "title": "Clozapine: Since the very beginning?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Psychosis in childhood and adolescence could be defined as having hallucinations, with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight. A broader definition includes symptoms such as delirious thoughts, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, cognitive and mood symptoms and what is called negative symptoms. Several researches have been done focused in the treatment of first episode of psychosis showing clozapine as a keystone in the treatment of psychosis, especially in refractory first episodes. Objectives Clozapine has unique efficacy in improving treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia but the moment of instauration remains unclear. There have always been doubts about the right moment to start clozapine, after two or more previous anti-psychotics or as first option. Materials and methods We report a 18-year- old woman with family history of severe psychosis. Her mum reasserted patient's symptoms contributing to a longer period of non-treating psychosis (about 10 months). Auditory hallucinations, incongruent mood and incoherent language appeared for the first time at the age of 17. High doses of two consecutive anti-psychotics were tried without remission and finally clozapine was initiated with clinical improvement. Discussion In clinical practice, a subgroup of psychotic patients experience, significant ongoing positive symptoms despite of using first line anti-psychotic medication. Conclusion Most recent research; suggest that clozapine may have an important role in the early treatment of first-episode patients, even becoming a first line option to consider.

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

      "title": "Alcoholism: Allostasis and Beyond",
      "abstract": "Alcoholism is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive drinking, loss of control over intake, and impaired social and occupational function. Animal models have been developed for various stages of the alcohol addiction cycle with a focus on the motivational effects of withdrawal, craving, and protracted abstinence. A conceptual framework focused on allostatic changes in reward function that lead to excessive drinking provides a heuristic framework with which to identify the neurobiologic mechanisms involved in the development of alcoholism. Neuropharmacologic studies in animal models have provided evidence for specific neurochemical mechanisms in specific brain reward and stress circuits that become dysregulated during the development of alcohol dependence. The brain reward system implicated in the development of alcoholism comprises key elements of a basal forebrain macrostructure termed the extended amygdala that includes the central nucleus of the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and a transition zone in the medial (shell) part of the nucleus accumbens. There are multiple neurotransmitter systems that converge on the extended amygdala that become dysregulated during the development of alcohol dependence, including gamma‐aminobutyric acid, opioid peptides, glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine. In addition, the brain stress systems may contribute significantly to the allostatic state. During the development of alcohol dependence, corticotropin‐releasing factor may be recruited, and the neuropeptide Y brain antistress system may be compromised. These changes in the reward and stress systems are hypothesized to maintain hedonic stability in an allostatic state, as opposed to a homeostatic state, and as such convey the vulnerability for relapse in recovering alcoholics. The allostatic model not only integrates molecular, cellular, and circuitry neuroadaptations in brain motivational systems produced by chronic alcohol ingestion with genetic vulnerability but also provides a key to translate advances in animal studies to the human condition.",

The case of Emma, who was presented to the pediatric emergency room, with numerous physiological complaints, such as; dizziness, severe headache, unconsciousness, vomiting. Specific examinations showed the absence of any possible organic cause. Based on the sessions conducted with the patient, it appears that the girl was sexually abused. During the clinical conversation, the patient is very withdrawn, isolated and does not want to talk. Appreciating her silence, the use of art therapy was seen as appropriate. Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient. Art therapy was used to assess her emotional, cognitive and rational state. Its use increased the efficiency of assessment and promoted the definition of treatment objectives. The girl was asked to draw all the members of her family. Interpretation of drawing when observed for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "Se trata de una observacion clinica durante un periodo de dos anos de un joven de 21 anos que se presentaba muchas veces en urgencias por una fuerte angustia con importantes trastornos del comportamiento caracterizados por agitaciones psicomotrices, automutilaciones repetidas, amenazas o intentos de homicidio hacia el padre, impulsos frecuentes y a veces conductas antisociales (fugas, estados de peligrosidad). En sus trastornos subyacian muchas veces ideas de persecucion y de referencia. Habia tambien frecuentes intentos de suicidio vinculados con breves periodos depresivos en los que verbalizaba un gran sufrimiento afectivo, que el explicaba esencialmente por dificultades relacionales familiares y por acontecimientos traumaticos (maltrato parental, accidentes). Dos anos despues, el cuadro clinico se agravo con la aparicion de sintomas esquizofrenicos constituidos por un delirio paranoide, alucinaciones con automatismo mental, retraccion social, desorganizacion afectiva y comportamental que se sustituyeron totalmente en sus pasos al acto autoagresivos. Luego se han vuelto mas complejos con la observacion psicoterapica que abre la problematica sexual e identitaria del paciente.La observacion consistio en una escucha atenta durante las entrevistas psicoterapicas regulares que han permitido recorrer la historia evolutiva de esta patologia, al mismo tiempo que su estabilizacion. Nuestro objetivo era despejar una perspectiva clinica y evolutiva que tomara en cuenta la progresion de los sintomas en funcion del tiempo hasta la constitucion de una psicosis propiamente dicha. Limitado por la exploracion neurobiologica (balances, EEG, IRM cerebral) sin resultado aparente, el analisis semiologico de los sintomas del paciente, de sus escritos y de sus simbolos nos ha permitido investigar diferentes fases precoces de la enfermedad, asi como el analisis psicopatologico de sus sintomas.Resultados: Esta experiencia personal nos ha permitido determinar el primer sintoma, conocer el periodo inicial de los trastornos y sus relaciones con los factores de vulnerabilidad (trauma parental y genetico), describir su evolucion segun la edad y reconstituir los sintomas de transicion psicotica. El fin de este articulo es subrayar el papel preventivo de la atencion precoz de los trastornos prepsicoticos. Sin embargo, sigue en pie el interrogante sobre el impacto de la angustia en el desarrollo neuropsiquico del paciente y sobre el origen genetico de la enfermedad. Conclusion: Insistimos en el enfoque preventivo que consiste en detectar los sujetos con riesgos de transicion psicotica y pensar en realizar una psicoterapia adaptada.",

      "title": "Cell-based therapies for neural replacement strategies in stroke-related neurodegeneration: neurophysiological insights into stem progenitor cell neurogenesis within a host environment",
      "abstract": "The restricted neurogenesis limits the brain ability to overcome neuronal cell death following ischemic lesion: Failure of the damaged brain to regenerate following cerebral ischemia results in functional deficits those are most often irreversible and can further deteriorate, causing mortality and severe disability, progressive memory loss and cognitive impairments, known as dementia. This is caused by massive neuronal cell death and neurotoxicity following limited blood supply to the brain. Ischemic death of brain neurons (acute or delayed after lesion) has been the etiology of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Multiple types of vascular dementia exist, common in cognitive decline that gradually worsens and variable in where strokes happen (subcortical dementia) or how severe lesions are (e.g., major stroke, series of small strokes or brief transient ischemic attacks). It has emerged a synergistic combination of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease that often comes (mixed dementia). For over the last three decades after the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death had been discovered, intense research has been focused on withdrawing or, at least, attenuating neurodegeneration to improve restoring function in experimental models of post-stroke cognitive impairments while mimicking focal ischemia, permanent or transient brain lesions, hypertension or reproducing Alzheimer's disease combined with vascular pathology [for review (Hainsworth et al., 2017)]. Long-standing perspectives that ischemic neuronal death might be potentially suspended through activation of endogenous neuroprotection stay with genomic reprogramming and/or gene activation for de novo protein synthesis, relied on the hypoxia-activated signaling pathways (Dirnagl et al., 2009). On the other hands, pre-clinical studies, including our own works (Kopach et al., 2016; Rybachuk et al., 2017), have reported functional impairments at the later times (weeks) post-ischemia (as in principal neurons as within network), with controversial effectiveness of pharmacological therapeutics utilized after lesion. Unfulfilled regeneration convinces experimental neuroscientists to focus on cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement strategies used to overcome massive neuronal loss in the brain tissue subjected to ischemia. The major issue, however, remains how this therapy should be utilized in order to promote beneficial effects timely, namely via engraftment of neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) or already differentiated stem cell-derived neurons into the damaged brain. From that, the other conceptual question arises regarding the regulatory role of a host environment in either NSPC neurogenesis or functional integration of the grafted stem cell-derived cells. If choose the latter, what 'proper' proportion of the entirely different phenotypes needs to be grafted to possibly succeed? More insights into this are essential when considering cell therapy while aiming at remodeling of the damaged post-stroke brain from mixed stem cell-derived cells for restoring the broken functionality of such a complex tissue as the brain. NSPC grafts mature neuronal phenotype within a host tissue in a weeks' time: The survival rate of differentiated stem cell-derived cells grafted into the organized brain tissue has been routinely low – this suggests a strong regulatory role of the host environment in the viability of stem cells. As an alternative, grafting NSPCs could potentially promote the multipotent stem cell differentiation and subsequent maturation of the entirely different phenotypes, regulated by endogenous environment, to pave the way towards 'self-repair' of damaged tissue while engaging the endogenous mechanisms of self-renewal. However, discoveries in this field are hampered by technical challenges and controversy in clinically translatable advances. Eventually, the enormous potential of stem cell therapy has been evidenced for post-stroke recovery (Tornero et al., 2017) while its neurophysiological basis has been much less learned thus far. Repeatedly reported common patterns of firing and synaptic activity have been recorded from the stem cell-derived neurons at the very end time-points – typically few months after transplantation – that fosters underestimation of the time-dependent neurophysiological integration of differentiated cells into the host tissue. In our recent study, we have traced the time courses of maturation and integration of the NSPC-derived neurons into the host circuits, demonstrating their matured excitability and synaptogenesis (to the level of endogenous principal neurons – CA1 pyramidal neurons) within 3 weeks or less in situ (Kopach et al., 2018). To neurophysiological point of view, biophysical properties (Na+/K+ conductance, capability for high-frequency firing, characteristic excitatory transmission) make these cells physiologically credible those are capable to constitute specified relationships with other cells, providing functional impact. This also points out the accelerated rate of neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts in situ when compared with much longer time required to achieve similar patterns of activity by stem cell-derived neurons in vitro (Morgan et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Telezhkin et al., 2016). For restorative neuroscience, a query remains to precisely define the timing of NSPC-derived phenotypes mature and set the appropriate activity within the damaged, pathophysiological environment. Establishing this is primary to enabling the assessment of timing for emerging beneficial effects, to design and rationale further reaching perspectives for accelerating stem cell neurogenesis while considering replacement strategies for various post-stroke brain regions (subpopulations of neurons, other neural cell types). Post-ischemic environment regulates neurogenesis of NSPC grafts: An in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia provides technological advantages for feasibly exploring the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death together with managing therapeutic approaches for targeted interventions in the organized brain tissue. In translational neuroscience, this methodology benefits with a meaningful consideration of variable experimental modifications utilized to mimic ischemic insult and onset of cell therapy (depending on how severe and complex the ischemic impairments are, diverse stem cell origin, etc.). In our study of an in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia optimized for a delayed death of principal neurons [within 2 weeks instead of acute CA1 neuronal death (Rybachuk et al., 2017)], we have traced the functional properties of NSPC grafts over the time in the hippocampal tissue subjected to ischemia (Figure 1; Kopach et al., 2018). The post-ischemic environment influenced neurogenesis of NSPC grafts in different ways. Neuronal maturation has been delayed, both excitability and synaptogenesis, at each time points tested (for over 3 weeks in total; Figure 1). Instead, multipotent NSPC differentiation has been prompted towards the non-neuronal phenotype – we have identified the NSPC-derived glial cells as fast as within a week in the post-ischemic tissue. Such principal difference in the stem cell fate between control and post-ischemic environments implies the determinant, yet underestimated, regulatory role of the host tissue in neurogenesis of NSPCs, both differentiation profile (neuronal vs. non-neuronal) and neurophysiological maturation.Figure 1: The experimental scheme of neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) administration in an in situ model of stroke.A carton shows the time course for functional assessment of the NSPC-derived neural maturation in a host tissue (organotypic hippocampal tissue subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation of 10 minutes duration, with onset of the therapy after 2 hours (h) of re-oxygenation). W: Week(s).Endogenous facilitators of stem cell fate: Ischemic cell damage results in the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity followed by massive neuronal death and overwhelmed neurotoxicity. Ultimately, different signaling molecules and mediators are released those levels became dramatically heightened, overloading the extracellular matrix and activating a vast majority of signaling pathways, with an immense variety of molecular mechanisms being involved. Moreover, during neuronal cell death, necrotic, pro-apoptotic factors and mediators of inflammation activate pro-inflammatory signaling, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and others, pertinent to overactivated astrocytic response featuring the post-ischemic brain. Numerous signaling cascades can, thus, contribute to how the ischemia-subjected environment governs the fate of NSPC grafts. The notable regulatory roles in stem cell differentiation have been evidenced for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), Ca2+-dependent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and Wnt signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo studies, among the involved cAMP, protein kinase C (PKC) and CaMK pathways, and phospholipase C and D signaling activation (Le Belle et al., 2011; Telezhkin et al., 2016). Therefore, pharmacological or genetic manipulations modulating presently dissecting signaling pathways, providing multiple growth facilitators, such as neurotrophins, to support intrinsic growth capacity of differentiating neurons, neutralizing high levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the post-ischemic tissue can accelerate neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts. Further, the supposed beneficial effects may include neurogenesis of the resident neural stem cells of the brain for activating endogenous self-renewal. By contrast, the non-neural (glial) NSPC differentiation, prompted up in the post-ischemic tissue, assumes the ROS-mediated regulation of NSPCs. The activated Notch signaling eliciting the latent neurogenic program in astrocytes after stoke (Magnusson et al., 2014) may have a synergistic effect on the post-ischemic NSPC differentiation to astrocytes. Functional restoration via multipotent NSPC function: Outcome after cell therapy is mediated by diverse mechanisms underlying functional improvements in the post-stroke recovery. Our study implies that NSPC therapy comprised primarily of promoted neurogenesis to a glial lineage that emerges shortly after initiating the therapy in the ischemia-subjected brain tissue (Kopach et al., 2018). This initial stage includes supplying the damaged tissue with the NSPC-derived astrocytes and oligodendrocytes – the output assuming the glia-related neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. The stem cell-derived astrocytes enhance the viability of brain cells by secreting various neurotrophic factors and supporting cell regeneration, evidenced for improving neurological function of post-stroke brain (Jiang et al., 2013), whereas oligodendrocytes' role has been proven in re-myelination and axon regeneration, both essential to synaptic networking (Figure 2). Such glial-directed differentiation of NSPC grafts, driven by overactivated master regulators that heavily burden the post-ischemic tissue, may mirror endogenous mechanism of boosting the glia-mediated tissue clearance following ischemic neuronal cell death. As the cellular debris became cleared and pro-apoptotic and inflammatory mediators recede, multipotent NSPC neurogenesis towards neuronal maturation takes place, which is the longer lasting process. Indeed, the ability of multipotent stem cells to mature with higher efficacy to neurons in astrocyte co-cultures had been evidenced. Other roles of glial cells have included the active astrocytic contribution to synapse formation, plasticity and remodeling that should facilitate network remodeling in the post-stroke tissue.Figure 2: The current concept of NSPC-therapy in stroke-related neurodegeneration encompasses the multipotent differentiation of NSPC grafts in a host tissue for replacement of various neural phenotypes after ischemia-induced cell loss for restoring the function in multiple ways.Conclusions and future perspectives: Ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is one of the leading causes of the brain damage that results in high rate of mortality and severe disability in patients after stroke (series of strokes). The stroke-related neurodegeneration gives rise to numerous neurological disorders, including cognitive decline (vascular dementia), motor disability (paralysis), and others associated with a wide range of impairments. Massive neuronal death after stroke could be barely overcame only by pharmacological interventions, but requires also implementation of cell therapies for replacement strategies. Although the long history of stem cell research had provided conceptual advances and clinical relevance of cell-based therapy, it has been less understood the neurophysiological basis of such tremendous effects of stem cells on the post-stroke recovery of brain function. Because recovery of the brain is not a single process, it is essential to clearly define the precise timing required for maturing of neurophysiological activity, ranging from intrinsic excitability to network function, for the entirely different stem cell-derived phenotypes. Dissecting this will expand the knowledge about stem cell therapy to find how best to use multiple routes of the therapy (induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cells) for the stroke-related neurodegeneration. More work is needed on defining the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell neurogenesis to provide the field with a meaningful consideration of cell therapy in context of promoting 'self-repair' of the post-stroke brain by engaging endogenous brain recovery mechanisms to power self-renewal. The perspective remains in accelerating neurophysiological maturation of neuronal phenotypes in the post-ischemic tissue tailored to enhancing the functional influence and, thereby, maximizing beneficial effects. Understanding the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell grafts will foster cell therapy use to augment therapeutic interventions in stroke-related neurodegeneration and to improve ultimate outcome.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria.

El registro del grado de agitacion en una escala de 100 puntos, proporciona la retroalimentacion necesaria para proseguir, revalorar, o concluir el tratamiento, dependiendo de los resultados obtenidos. Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol. Si no se logra la sedacion en menos de seis horas, despues de una dosis total de 60 mgs de haloperidol y 8 mgs de lorazepam, administrados por via intramuscular, entonces se recomienda aplicar la combinacion por via endovenosa.",

All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia.

Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia.

Particularly, it is noted to be very likely that depression after abstinence is an incentive to re-start drinking. In this study, we investigated depressive feeling in aspects of psychiatric and physical subjective symptoms after abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence, and compared the symptoms with those in patients with involutional depression. On analysis of the major component of psychiatric subjective symptoms, a sense of alienation, emotional instability, anxiety, and aggressiveness were observed. In involutional depression, depressive feeling, somnipathy, anxiety, self accusation/sense of guilt, delusion of culpability were observed. On analysis of the major component of physical subjective symptoms, autonomic nervous symptoms accompanied by feebleness, hysterical neurosis-like autonomic nervous symptoms, reduced sexual libido, anorexia, hydrodipsia/sweating were observed. Similarly, in patients with involutional depression, hysterical neurosis-like autonomic nervous symptoms, anorexia, elevation of tonus, general malaise, and hydrodipsia were noted. Differences in status were emphasized in comparison between the two groups in both analyses. Unlike involutional depression that exhibits the current features of depression, patients with alcohol dependence showed a sense of alienation, emotional instability, anxiety, and aggressiveness, reflecting self-uncertainty and loss of self-respect. Drinking may be re-started to relieve or reduce tension and frustration in such conditions.",

      "abstract": "Given the large availability of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) throughout the brain, and the wide range of neurotransmitter systems affected (norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine), nicotine influences a wide variety of cognitive domains such as sensorial, motor, attention, executive function, learning and memory. This article reviews current state of the art research on the effects of nicotine upon cognition. There are different neurobiological mechanisms involved in acute/chronic smoking and nicotine abstinence. Smoking reinforcement could be due to the initial cognitive improvement, that is, individuals can learn that smoking temporarily increases cognitive functioning (improving some components of attention and memory). These acute nicotine effects improve (i) cognitive performance above smokers' normal levels, and (ii) cognitive disruption resulting from nicotine abstinence. Both neurobiological effects act as reinforcers to nicotine use, greatly contributing to the development of nicotine dependence. However, heavy smoking is associated with cognitive impairment and cognitive decline in middle age. Future clinical research should investigate the role of positive and negative cognitive effects of nicotine in smoking cessation treatment. This is clearly an important scientific issue, with insufficient current data from which to draw definitive conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population. Gastric acid blockers, benzodiazepines, some antidepressants and opioid analgetics have been described in the review.",

Depressive symptoms have negative effect on the rehabilitation process, quality of life and even on long-term survival. Considering drug therapy, in the past decade tricyclic drugs have been replaced by newly developed antidepressants with milder side-effects profile. Our knowledge on the relationship among vascular and other types of dementia has been extended in the recent years. This development also has some therapeutic implications.

      "title": "Alcohol Consumption – Implications in Orthopedic Trauma",
      "abstract": "In mental health field is established that alcohol consumption can exacerbate an underlying mental health disorder. Among people with severe mental health are common alcohol problems. Alcohol depress the central nervous system and this might produce moods fluctuation and worsen the depression and anxiety. At heavy and/or chronic drinkers were reported several symptoms involving cognitive ability including diminished brain size, memory loss, loss of attention span, loss of visuospatial abilities, inability to think abstractly, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Alcohol can temporarily alleviate feelings of depression and anxiety, so people tend to use it as a form of ‘self medication’ in order to cheer themselves up or as a sleep help. But also, alcohol can disturb the body’s ability to rest, so it can lead to reduced energy levels. The key to mental health patients who regularly consume alcohol is the toxic cyclical process created. At first, one drink to relieve depression, but alcohol deplete serotonin levels, so the patient feels more depressed and thus necessitating more alcohol to ‘treat’ his depression. Sometimes it can also reveal or intensify underlying feelings, evoke past memories of trauma or any other event associated with painful feelings. Moreover, alcohol has pain-reducing properties (sustained also in a systematic review published in December 2016 issue of “The Journal of Pain”) by decreasing the activity of nerves within the brain. Furthermore, this chronic ‘self medication’ with alcohol has a wider action on the body. 1. Growing Bone - Epidemiological studies shows that chronic alcohol consumption at young age affect the bone’s health; it has multiple effects on osteoblasts (forming cells), slows down the bone turnover and can increase the risk of osteoporosis. 2. Adult Bone - There were studies on animals and researches in human adults made to prove the relationship between alcohol consumption and bones’ health. The results show that the alcohol consumption is less damaging for adults than young people, but research has shown that seventh decade women or older who consumed an average of more than 3 ounces of alcohol/day (equivalent of six drinks) had greater bone loss than women who had minimal alcohol intake. (Hannan et al. 2000) So postmenopausal chronic heavy drink women have an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. Researches suggest that alcohol consumption and poor nutrition and/or tobacco use lowers even more bones’ mineralization and increase the likelihood of bone fractures. Dr. Iliriana Bisha Tagani presented for SteadyHealth the relationship between alcohol consumption and joint pain. Alcohol dehydratate the organism because of it’s diuretic properties. Ligaments are structures rich in water and need water periodically to remain soft and spongy. So high alcohol consumption leads to excess removal of water from the body. The ligaments are one of the first to get affected by dehydration so they lose from their elasticity and any movement of the joints can lead to unbearable pain and arthritis (moreover, alcohol is considered an arthritis „trigger food”). 3. Immunity - Chronic heavy consumption of alcohol can suppress the immune system after a period of time. It can also cause neuropathy, making someone feel a pins and needles sensation in their extremities, a compounded effect with those who suffer from arthritis. In conclusion, patients with mental health disorder present an increase tendency of alcohol abuse, which predominant leads to articular and bones disfunctions. These patients also presents a high tolerance pain due to analgestic and neuropathic effects which frequently masks the symptoms of affections like arthritis.",

      "abstract": "Patients with mental disorders exhibit a range of abnormal movements. The severely depressed are given to hand wringing, pacing, and restlessness. Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

Typical manifestations include tremor, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, agitation, and excess sweating. Complicated withdrawal syndrome may manifest with seizures (including cluster seizures), status epilepticus, acute psychosis and delirium, when hallucinations are accompanied by disorientation in time, place and situation. About 10–15% of patients develop complicated withdrawal syndrome. The seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome are triggered in the brain stem and have a mechanism other than that of classic epileptic seizures. Benzodiazepines, which are more effective than other classes of anticonvulsants (they primarily reduce the frequency of convulsions in the first two days after alcohol discontinuation and significantly reduce the risk of death), are the gold standard for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) is a helpful tool for making decisions on treatment initiation or discontinuation. It should be noted that chronic use of benzodiazepines in the secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures is not recommended due to the addictive potential of these agents and a more severe course of alcohol withdrawal seizures with benzodiazepine co-dependence.",

      "title": "Behavioral Changes Associated with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy can be accompanied by changes in cognition, personality, affect, and other elements of behavior. There is no single epileptic constitution or personality complex. A unifying theme to the behavior in epilepsy is diversity. As one looks at the behavioral traits reported in epilepsy, a specific and consistent pattern is lacking. Rather, extremes of behavior are accentuated: sometimes in one direction, often in both directions. Changes in emotional state are prominent among behavioral features in epilepsy. Some authors describe a prominent deepening or increase in emotionality, whereas others identify a global decrease in emotional life and content. Emotional lability is also reported. Sexuality and libido are typically decreased, but fetishism, transvestism, exhibitionism, and hypersexual episodes also occur. Concerns over morality may be lacking or exaggerated. Patients may be irritable and aggressive or timid and apathetic. The impressive list of people with epilepsy in politics, religion, arts, and sciences suggests a positive expression of this behavioral spectrum. Psychosis, depression, paranoia, and personality disorders may represent a negative pole of epilepsy-related behavioral changes. The most important aspect of behavioral changes in epilepsy for physicians is to recognize and treat dysfunctional behavior. Depression is a common problem that is often unrecognized and untreated. Other treatable problems include impotence, anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis. Identifying risk factors will, it is hoped, assist in developing methods to prevent these disorders.",

Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family.

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "The most commonly reported findings in the brains of alcoholics are sulcal widening and ventricular enlargement as well as cortical white matter shrinkage. The frontal lobes appear to be more vulnerable to alcoholrelated brain damage than other cerebral regions. The cerebellum, cortical-limbic circuits, skeletal muscle, and peripheral nerves are also important targets of chronic alcohol-related metabolic injury and degeneration [1-3]. Although all cell types within the nervous system are vulnerable to the toxic, metabolic and degenerative effects of alcohol, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and synaptic terminals are major targets, accounting for the white matter atrophy [4]. A heavy drinking history is a cardinal feature in the criteria for alcoholic dementia, which include memory impairment in addition to one or more other cognitive symptoms. Among the cognitive symptoms are dysphasia, apraxia, agnosia, and disturbance in executive functioning [3]. All these features were found in our patient and were persistent for at least 6 months of follow-up. a 43 year-old man was brought to the emergency room with head trauma following a fall. His medical history was significant for heavy alcoholism since age 35 and related falls and injuries. Neurological examination demonstrated significant memory impairment, dysphasia, apraxia, agnosia and disturbance in executive functioning, leading to the diagnosis of alcoholic dementia. Computed tomography (CT) scan of his head repeated during 6 years demonstrated progressive central and peripheral brain atrophy with sulcal widening, ventricular enlargement, and cortical white matter shrinkage characteristic of chronic alcohol abuse [Figure 1]. Long-standing heavy alcohol abuse leads to disproportionate loss of white matter with reduction in brain volume and brain weight. Alcohol abuse is a very serious health, social and economic problem worldwide. The present case conveys a clear message regarding the brain damage that results from chronic alcohol abuse.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Acute dystonic reaction due to a combination of chloroquine and doxycycline in an emergency psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects that are seen after the initiation or a rapid increase in the dose of neuroleptic drugs, mainly typical antipsychotics, and have a varied presentation, such as torticollis, trismus, “mouth opening” dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.[1] They frequently present to clinicians in an emergency setting and may sometimes be tricky to handle. Drug-induced movement disorders usually have a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset (some typically occurring with first dose).[1] They are also dose – dependent, and with the exception of tardive syndromes, have a complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent.[1] Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation, or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.[1] Chloroquine is a drug commonly used for the treatment of malaria and has been reported to have gastrointestinal problems, headaches, blurring of vision, and itching as the common side effects.[2] Dystonia induced by chloroquine, although rare, is not really new and is mentioned in patient information leaflets.[2] However, such incidents are rare and mainly have been reported with the first dose. No case reports on acute dystonic reactions with a stable dose of chloroquine or with doxycycline are available. In view of current coronavirus disease pandemic, several combinations of antibiotics and antivirals are being tried and this report necessitates an exercise of caution for possible adverse drug reactions. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency psychiatry setting with the complaints of difficulty in lowering his gaze, up-rolling of eyeballs, and difficulty in jaw opening for the last 2 h. On examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He had difficulty in opening his mouth and lowering his gaze. He appeared to have an acute dystonic reaction presenting with trismus and oculogyric crisis. Other aspects of his general examination were unremarkable. His systemic examination, which included an exhaustive neurological examination, was normal. All baseline investigations, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, and random blood glucose, were within normal limits. His resting electrocardiogram was also normal. There was no past history of similar complaints or of any transient ischemic attack, and he had neither a family history of dystonia nor a history of alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, or use of illicit drugs or history of taking psychotropic medications. On enquiry, the patient yielded that he had fever for the past 3–4 days, for which he was taking some medications from a physician. All his blood parameters were normal, and he had tested negative for dengue and malaria. However, as it is a common practice in India to empirically start a patient on antibiotics, he had been started on chloroquine (500 mg once daily dosing) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day). It was after his third dose that he had developed an acute dystonic reaction. Immediately, an injection of promethazine 50 mg was administered intramuscularly. After 15 min, there was some relief in his symptoms. Later on, after giving an injection of intravenous diazepam 5 mg, the patient's symptoms improved considerably. He was kept was observation for 2–3 h and later discharged on oral diazepam 5 mg once daily for 3 days. He was asked to discontinue the antibiotics, and on follow-up, the patient had no further complaints and reported 100% improvement. DISCUSSION Rampant use of antibiotics and their amalgamations has concerning effects such as antimicrobial resistance and higher occurrence of adverse side effects. While most side effects appear nonchalant, there are a few which could be life-threatening, such as acute dystonic reaction. Oculogyric crisis is the only form of acute dystonia that may occur, while the patient is receiving a stable dose of an antipsychotic drug; it may be provoked by alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, or suggestion.[3] Given the paucity of literature on chloroquine- and doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, we report a case of an acute dystonic reaction presenting as oculogyric crisis with trismus in a patient who was on a stable dose of chloroquine and doxycycline, being empirically treated for fever with a combination of antimalarial and broad-spectrum antibiotic. At a standard dose for malaria treatment, the common adverse effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, nightmare, blurring of vision, and itching. Using the Naranjo algorithm, the patient appeared to have probable adverse drug reaction when chloroquine was considered as a cause (score = 6). If doxycycline is considered as a cause alone, the score would be 5 indicating probable adverse drug reactions due to it. The difference of scoring occurs only on the first question of the algorithm as no report mentions dystonia due to doxycycline. This also sheds light on the importance of the first question of the Naranjo algorithm and the need to report such possible adverse reactions. Acute dystonic reactions usually result due to dopamine receptor-2 (D2) blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output.[1] The pathophysiological mechanism underlying chloroquine-associated acute dystonic reaction suggests a reduction in the forebrain catecholamine levels and an inhibition of neuronal calcium uptake.[4] Gamma aminobutyric acid has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute dystonic reactions, and this is supported by the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in reducing chloroquine-induced acute dystonic reactions.[1] This also explains why our patient improved with diazepam and promethazine had minimal effect on him. There is no available literature on doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, and whether this drug had a contribution in the development of oculogyric crisis in our patient is uncertain. The combination of chloroquine and doxycycline has been shown to be synergistic in the treatment of malaria with increased efficacy of chloroquine on addition of doxycycline.[5] This could perhaps also predispose patients on this combination to develop rare side effects such as dystonia. Doxycycline has been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and increase levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain and can theoretically lead to dystonia.[6] Hence, we advocate an index of suspicion for oculogyric crisis whenever these drugs are being prescribed, especially in combination.

It is precipitated by medical illness, substance intoxication/withdrawal or medication effect. Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a leading presenting symptom of illness in the elderly. Elderly patients with altered mental status, including agitation, should be presumed to have delirium until proven otherwise. The clinical manifestations of delirium are highly variable. A mental status evaluation is crucial in the diagnosis of delirium. Medical evaluation and stabilization should occur in parallel. Life-threatening etiologies including hypoxia, hypoglycemia and hypotension require immediate intervention. The differential diagnosis of etiologies of delirium is extensive. Patients with delirium need thorough evaluations to determine the underlying causes of the delirium. Pharmacological agents should be considered when agitated patient has the potential to harm themselves or others, or is impeding medical evaluation and management. Unfortunately, the evidence to guide pharmacologic management of acute agitation in the elderly is limited. Current pharmacologic options include the typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and the benzodiazepines. These therapeutic options are reviewed in detail.",

According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

There are several types of disorder of thought train, such as loosing of association, flight of idea, incoherence, inhibition of thought, blocking of thought, circumstantial thinking and perseveration. Although these symptoms are characteristics of functional mental disorder, they can be observed as one of the symptoms of the dementia, delirium and disturbance of consciousness in the elderly. If the elderly patients show these symptoms with psychosis, mania and depression, the organic or drug induced mental disorder should be excluded. Patients with aphasia or parkinsonism also should be paid attention to examine train of thought, so they often seem to have inhibition of thought and blocking of thought.",

      "abstract": "This contribution reviews the international literature about dual diagnosis, meaning patients who have simultaneously mental health problems and substance use disorders and discusses epidemiology, clinical characteristics, but primarily etiopathogenesis and different treatment models and interventions. The epidemiological data coming from large-scale studies in the general population in USA, Australia and UK demonstrate the close relationship between mental health problems and substance use disorders. Also, the results from Greek research projects support this close relationship, but their research designs have significant limitations. Multiple and high risks are common in this population, like violent or suicidal behavior, self-harm, physical problems, while they appear less responsive to treatment. Subsequently, different models for etiopathogenesis of dual diagnosis have been suggested: (a) Causal relationship: secondary substance use disorder is subsequent of primary mental illness (self-medication hypothesis, supersenstivity model) or vice versa (alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine use trigger or contribute to development of mental illness). (b) Third factor as the cause of both mental and substance use disorders (genetic factor, neuropathology, traumatic experience, personality characteristics, multiple factors). (c) Comorbidty is due to chance. (d) Each disorder mutually exacerbates the other, regardless the cause. Here, the relationship between alcohol and depression is discussed further as example. The ideas and the research-evidence which support each of these models are presented. Also there is an overview of different treatment models: (a) Consecutive treatment: mental health treatment and substance misuse treatment are provided consecutively. (b) Parallel treatments: the patient attends programs of both mental health and substance use services simultaneously. (c) Integrated treatment: the same clinical team addresses both mental health issues and substance use disorders. The first two models have significant weaknesses due to lack of focus on the interaction of the different disorders or to administrative and managerial barriers. On the other hand, integrated programs appear to overcome these limitations. They use modified interventions provided by the same team in order to address the multiple needs of the patients. Different types of integrated programs are discussed. More pragmatist inter ventions should also be taken into consideration. It is expected that some direction for research and clinical practice to Greece will emerge from this contribution.",

Substance dependence is accompanied by loss of control over the amount used, continued use despite negative consequences, preoccupation with use, and dysphoria during abstinence. In heavy and long-term users, abrupt cessation or reduction in substance use results in withdrawal syndrome. Risk of substance dependence is influenced by genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors. Patients with substance use disorders come from all age groups and from all ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds.",

For years, there has been a controversy as to whether addiction was simply a moral failing or a brain disease. Obviously, the latter is true. As with any disease, addiction and co-occurring disorders are frequently considered to be primary, progressive, chronic, and, if untreated, fatal. With the advent of more sophisticated neurobiological and multivariate research, we can get beyond trivializing this serious disease entity by labeling it as a weakness or character defect, and get on with the significant work of focusing on those neurological pathways and their etiology that are responsible for addictive patterns of behavior.",

Este ensayo reflexivo, se ha propuesto analizar el fenómeno y abordarlo desde diversas perspectivas psicológicas que nos brinden una posible explicación lógica y coherente del suceso con el fin de esclarecerlo frente a las supersticiones de la cultura a través del método hermenéutico. Los signos de los posesos pueden deberse a otros factores, tanto neurobiológicos como psicológicos, como, por ejemplo, la aversión a los objetos religiosos y el surgimiento de una segunda personalidad, puede deberse a un cuadro de trastorno conversivo (neurosis) o presentarse en la esquizofrenia (psicosis), y la amnesia después del episodio puede deberse a la sobrecarga funcional del cerebro. Existen otros signos más complejos de explicar, como lo son el hablar en lenguas diferentes o la levitación; el primero lo trataremos descriptivamente desde el síndrome del idioma extranjero, que puede presentarse producto de factores neurológicos o en la misma psicosis, y la levitación podemos verla desde la física, con la llamada levitación magnética, a través de una hipótesis en la cual esta condición podría cumplirse en los seres humanos debido a la sobreexcitación cerebral que generaría cierto campo magnético. Finalmente, dentro de los aportes del psicoanálisis encontramos la neurosis como forma en que se manifiesta este fenómeno y damos por concluido que la posesión demoníaca se debe a dos sucesos: neurosis o psicosis, recalcando la importancia del análisis del contexto para realizar criterios diferenciadores en nuestro diagnóstico psicológico.",

What is it about a trauma that influences health? Several candidates immediately come to mind. Psychologically, personal upheavals provoke intense and long-lasting emotional changes. The unexpected events are generally associated with cognitive disruption, including rumination and attempts to understand what happened and why. Socially, traumas are known to cause wholesale disruptions in people’s social networks. Behaviorally, and perhaps because of the social and psychological changes, traumas are often associated with lifestyle changes such as unhealthy smoking, drinking, exercise, sleeping, and eating patterns. Each of these psychological, social, and behavioral effects is associated with a host of biological changes, including elevations in cortisol, immune disruption, cardiovascular changes, and a cascade of neurotransmitter changes.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem. Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits such as dementia. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM. In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycaemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglyacemia have deleterious effect on the brain. Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycaemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits. Hypoglycaemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic hyperglycaemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function such as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function. The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia-related cognitive dysfunction include, macro- and microvascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycaemia on the brain, advanced glycation end-products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Hyperglycaemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus. Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM. The knowledge that diagnosis at an early age, frequency of hypoglycaemia, poor glycaemic control and presence of risk factors negatively affect cognitive functions in DM will have important implications for treatment and research purposes.",

Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

However, the effects vary considerably, depending upon the hallucinogen ingested. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is suffering from hallucinogen intoxication such as marijuana use can be helpful to the clinician. However, the common toxicologic drug screens used by most clinical laboratories do not detect many hallucinogenic agents (such as LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide]).

      "title": "[Neurobiology of alcohol withdrawal inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters].",
      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal is a syndrome that is the result of adaptive changes in the brain secondary to chronic alcohol use and is associated with changes in many neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, and hormonal systems. Long-term exposure to ethanol leads to an imbalance in different excitatory (especially glutamate, a major excitatory amino acid), and inhibitory neurotransmitter (especially GABA, a major inhibitory amino acid) systems. When alcohol consumption is reduced or completely ceases, these imbalances are behaviorally expressed in the form of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are mainly associated with the hypofunction of GABA receptors and enhanced function of NMDA receptors. The imbalance between receptors may be exacerbated by repeated withdrawal. Some of these alterations may last for months following alcohol cessation and cause symptoms of protracted alcohol withdrawal, which may contribute to the continuation of the cycle of alcohol addiction relapses. The search for biological alterations during alcohol withdrawal may not only render some important insights into the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence, but might also identify new targets for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and for preventing relapses following withdrawal. Therapists specializing in the treatment of addiction should be cognizant of the underlying biological mechanisms of alcohol withdrawal in order to more adequately understand the physiopathology of substance dependence in general. In this paper, we will review the changes in the inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter systems involved in alcohol withdrawal, and we will discuss their roles in the development of alcohol dependence.",

      "abstract": "Official statistics indicate that during the last decade, the frequency of borderline mental disorders has rapidly increased. Among those disorders significant numbers involve neurotic and somatoform disorders, reactive depressions, disorders of adaptation, and acute, prolonged, or delayed reactions to stress. Adverse environmental conditions and the vulnerability of individual personalities are considered to play a leading role in the genesis of these disorders. The range of psychogenic factors that give rise to borderline disorders is relatively broad; they include negative macrosocial processes, changes in way of life, extreme situations in war and peacetime, interpersonal conflicts, difficult family situations, personal failures, misfortunes, losses, etc. The development of pathological symptoms is accompanied by maladjustment, disruptions in the patient's social interactions and functioning in the community, family, everyday life, and on the job, and a decrease in the value and quality of life all of which frequently lead to various behavioral deviations: suicidal behavior, aggressive and criminal acts, and/or alcoholism and drug addiction [1, 4, 5].

No obstante, existen algunos vacíos de conocimiento en relación con esta problemática. Por ejemplo, aún no está del todo claro, por la poca evidencia disponible, cómo se relacionan el estrés académico y los hábitos de estudio inadecuados o la ansiedad y la somnolencia diurna en un ambiente educativo con estas características. Si estas asociaciones se demuestran, o se llegan a entender mejor, se podría concluir entonces que estudiar medicina (en particular) o una carrera universitaria con demandas académicas y emocionales similares (en general), tendría un nexo causal con los problemas de salud vinculados con la ansiedad, las alteraciones del sueño y los altos índices de estrés. Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial. Adicionalmente, vivir una experiencia de aprendizaje con este tipo de tensiones puede desencadenar dificultades para la concentración y la memoria, procesos que son fundamentales para el éxito académico.",

This definition is derived initially from behavioral models of learning, and in the field of addiction, most work with sensitization refers to the progressive increase in the motor stimulant effect of amphetamine-like psychostimulants that is elicited by repeated drug administration (2,3). Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Three of the most important concern 1) variability in cognitive‐perceptual functioning in samples of alcoholics, 2) differential vulnerability of cognitive‐perceptual functions to alcohol abuse and 3) the relationship of cognitive‐perceptual impairment to treatment behaviour and benefit. Consideration of these issues resulted in the following conclusions. There is a substantial minority of alcoholics who do not manifest impairment on any given cognitive test. Variability of findings with different samples of alcoholics may be, in part, a function of family history of alcoholism and/or severity of alcoholism. Verbal and rote learning functions are less sensitive to alcohol abuse than non‐verbal, or complex verbal, abstracting/problem‐solving skills. Alcoholics' impersonal and interpersonal problem‐solving abilities are both impaired but appear to be uncorrelated. Impairment in cognitive‐perceptual functioning in alcoholics does predict therapists' ratings of treatment behaviour and benefit.",

Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time.

The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between alcoholism and depressive disorder is complex. Nevertheless it is necessary to analyse this relationship in order to take in charge properly the patients with such a comorbidity. Firstly, some alcoholic patients may develop a major depressive disorder in their life without any relationship with their alcoholism (accidental co-occurrence). Secondly, the vast majority of alcoholic patients have experienced depressive symptoms, specially during withdrawal. Finally, some alcoholics may present a severe depressive episode that require a specific treatment, the alcoholism being explained (secondary alcoholism) or not (primary alcoholism) by the depressive disorder. The alcoholism/depression comorbidity majors the consequences of alcoholism, increases the frequency of hospitalisation, and worsens the prognostic. It is thus important to detect such a comorbidity, although the evaluation of mood is complex in alcohol-dependent patients. The age at onset of each disorder, and the modification of one disorder during partial remission of the other, help to distinguish primary and secondary alcoholism. Antidepressive drugs are mainly limited to severe depression, primary depression, and depression with a high risk of suicide.",

Cocaine use can cause psychiatric and physical diseases in the individual, but it can also cause social and legal problems. Genetic, sociocultural and pharmacological factors, some factors related to learning and conditioning have an important role in the etiology of cocaine addiction. Cocaine exerts its psychoactive and addictive effects through the limbic system in the brain, which regulates pleasure and motivation. The nucleus accumbens, which is a part of the limbic system, is the most important region that mediates the effect of cocaine. Cocaine use can often be seen together with other psychiatric diseases, and it can also cause damage by affecting other system organs, especially the central nervous system. In this article, the neurochemical effects of cocaine, related psychiatric/physical diseases and treatment options are presented in the light of current information.",

These include finding it difficult to control the need to use the drug and feeling the use of the drug to be more important than more normal things such as family or work. When the person does not use the drug for an amount of time, they may suffer from withdrawal. When a person is addicted, they are usually addicted to a class (a specific kind) of drug. For example, Heroin is a drug that is in the Opiate class, which means that a person addicted to Heroin may also be seen to have an addiction to other opiates such as Morphine. A person who may easily become addicted to drugs is said to have an addictive personality. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines drug addiction as a mental disorder. Drug addiction is often linked with other mental disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn the present book, fifteen typical literatures about drug addiction published on international authoritative journals were selected to introduce the worldwide newest progress, which contains reviews or original researches on human health, illegal drugs, neuroscience, psychology, ect. We hope this book can demonstrate advances in drug addiction as well as give references to the researchers, students and other related people.",

A victim, suspect and/or eyewitness may have been under the influence of a drug around the time the relevant events of the case occurred.

The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience.

      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated.

Understanding the experience of anger will provide you insight into the role anger may play in your life and that of your child. Certain of these reactions typically accompany acute (intense, short lived) anger. Other reactions, such as sleep difficulties, digestive problems, cynicism, and loss of faith may occur with the development of chronic (long-lived) anger.

O objetivo deste estudo foi revisar a literatura quanto às consequências individuais, econômicas e sociais causadas pela SAOS. Identificaram-se diversas complicações da SAOS relacionadas ao indivíduo: (1) alterações físicas e comportamentais: sono excessivo, fadiga, ansiedade, irritabilidade, depressão, redução da libido, diminuição da qualidade de vida, astenia, consequências metabólicas (ganho de peso, diabetes e dislipidemia) e cardiovasculares (hipertensão arterial sistêmica, aterosclerose e doença coronariana); (2) disfunção neurocognitiva: déficits de atenção, percepção, memória, raciocínio, juízo, pensamento e linguagem. Quanto à relação da SAOS e repercussões socioeconômicas, tem-se: (1) aumento do número, proporção e gravidade de acidentes automobilísticos devido à diminuição da concentração do motorista; (2) prejuízos ocupacionais com queda na produtividade, demissões e acidentes de trabalho; (3) prejuízo social: o individuo com SAOS representa também um perigo potencial para toda a sociedade por aumento de imperícias; (4) aumento de gastos públicos e privados: manutenção de rodovias e estrutura de fiscalização e apoio, gastos previdenciários, custos diagnósticos, terapêuticos e hospitalares.

Four clinical entities are described: Wernicke's encephalopathy is the most frequent of these, with progressive development of disorders of consciousness, oculomotor palsies and ataxia. The condition regresses under massive vitamin BA therapy, but it often leaves neuropsychological sequelae (e. g. Korsakoff's syndrome). The best treatment is prevention by giving thiamine to alcoholics and to malnourished subjects who receive glucose infusions. Cerebellar atrophy of alcoholic origin is responsible for subacute ataxia which, as a rule, is definitive. Central pontine myelinolysis is rare and presents as sudden quadriplegia with pseudobulbar palsy and sometimes \"locked-in\" syndrome. Beside alcohol, a frequent cause is major ionic disorders, such as hyponatraemia or its excessively rapid correction. Pellagra is a classical disease rarely seen in this country. It is due to nicotinamide (vitamin PP) deficiency.",

The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

Estos pacientes suelen recibir un diagnóstico clínico de “trastorno de la personalidad”, pero probablemente sea más apropiado describirlos como pacientes “multiproblemáticos” debido a los déficits ampliamente extendidos en su funcionamiento cognitivo, emocional, conductual y social. Estos pacientes suelen experimentar estados emocionales negativos crónicos, como depresión, ansiedad, apatía, aburrimiento, soledad, culpa e ira. Este afectividad alterada es el principal impulsor de una plétora de respuestas de afrontamiento desadaptativas: las principales son la conducta suicida repetitiva y las conductas adictivas como el abuso de alcohol/drogas, los trastornos alimentarios y/o la automutilación crónica. Los pacientes multiproblemáticos también experimentan importantes déficits en el funcionamiento social e interpersonal. Tienen problemas para formar y mantener relaciones interpersonales y a menudo introducen en el proceso terapéutico un conjunto de cuestiones conflictivas en torno a la formación y el mantenimiento de relaciones adultas, tanto superficiales como íntimas. La cantidad y la magnitud de estos problemas conductuales, cognitivos y emocionales son una fuente de frustración para los terapeutas...",

The content of obsessions is ego‐dystonic, meaning that they are experienced as intrusive, unwanted, and generally inconsistent with one's self‐image, values, beliefs, and behaviors. Obsessions differ from ego‐syntonic thoughts about everyday problems (e.g., recurrent thoughts or worries about finances, occupation, relationships, and the like) and should be distinguished from the “brooding” ruminations that are common in depression. Typical obsessions include doubts about whether one did something adequately (e.g., turned off the stove); intrusive sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts or images (e.g., horrific image of stabbing a friend); thoughts about contamination; and excessive concerns about symmetry or exactness. Individuals with Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder (OCD) experience frequent obsessions that are severe enough to cause significant functioning impairment and try to suppress or neutralize their obsessions with other thoughts or compulsive actions. Unlike individuals with psychotic or delusional disorders, individuals with OCD generally recognize their obsessions as senseless and know that the obsessions originate in their own minds.",

      "abstract": "Mind and body are inseparable entities and influences each other until death. Many factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, negative thoughts, unhealthy life style, unwholesome diet etc., disturb mental and physical wellbeing. Senile dementia is the mental deterioration, i.e, loss of intellectual ability associated with old age. It causes progressive deterioration of mental faculties, e.g., memory, intellect, attention, thinking, comprehension and personality, with preservation of normal level of consciousness. Two major types of senile dementia have been identified, namely that due to generalized atrophy in the cortical area of the brain (Alzheimer's type) and that due to vascular disorders mainly due to stroke. According to DSM-IV (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders), the essential feature of dementia is the development of multiple cognitive deficits that include memory impairment and at least one of the following cognitive disturbances such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or a disturbance in executive function. For the present study, a standardized questionnaire in the form of proforma incorporating types of foods (madhura, amla and lavana rasayukta ahara etc.) and life style (divaswapna, ratrijagarana and manasika bhavas etc) is prepared. To assess manasika bhava, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, and standardized gradations of anumana pariksha of manasika bhavas mentioned by Charaka at Vimana Sthana 4/8 were adopted. In this study, most of the patients had disturbed sleep, tendency to indulge in defective dietary habits and kapha vitiating diets and life style. On Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, patients had anxiety, tension, depression, difficulty in concentration, and memory. On Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, these patients had anxiety, depression, and hypochondriasis. On Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, psychological factors affected include: anxiety, depression, somatic concern and tension, etc. The data reflects that unwholesome diet and disturbed mental health plays an important role in etiopathogenesis of senile dementia.",

      "title": "Organic cerebral reactions in alcoholism: psychobiological aspects of treatment.",
      "abstract": "The paper considers the rational biological basis for treatment of alcohol withdrawal reactions, alcoholic hallucinosis and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Both clinical and experimental data indicate that the alcohol withdrawal reaction reflects a state of hyper-reactivity of the central nervous system. The evidence comprises physiological, electrophysiological and biochemical findings. Magnesium, vitamins and antipsychotics are not specific in the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal reactions per se; rational treatment comprises drugs that may substitute for the suppressive effects of alcohol in the CNS during readaptation to the alcohol free condition (e.g. barbiturates or benzodiazepines). Alcoholic hallucinosis is characterised by acutely developed auditory hallucinations of an evil or reproachful nature. The condition may develop during or shortly after excessive alcohol consumption in chronic alcoholics. Suggestibility and unclear consciousness is not part of the condition. Tentatively three subgroups are suggested to occur: a) a withdrawal reaction; treatment with sedatives is recommended; the prognosis is good, b) a toxic reaction occurring during the drinking bout; this condition should be treated with antipsychotics until symptoms have disappeared. The prognosis is fairly good, c) a schizophreniform condition. Long-term treatment with antipsychotics must be applied. The Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is described. The condition often occurs during or shortly after an acute withdrawal reaction. The biochemical role of the etiological factor thiamine in glucose metabolism suggests that precautions (thiamine treatment) must be taken when giving a glucose load to alcoholics. Finally focus is set on the recent suggestion that the syndrome may in some cases result from an inborn enzymatic abnormality comprising low binding of thiamine pyrophosphate to transketolase. Psychobiological aspects of treatment in alcoholism may apply to a very large spectrum of conditions involving symptoms of cerebral, hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardial and peripheral nervous system origin. In the present expose we shall concentrate on organic cerebral reactions partly or exclusively presenting with psychiatric symptoms and signs. Thus the review will consider the rational biological basis for treatment of alcohol withdrawal reactions (including delirium tremens), alcoholic hallucinosis and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.",

As alterações neuropatológicas marcantes da DA são placas difusas e neuríticas, marcadas pela deposição extracelular de beta-amiloide, e emaranhados neurofibrilares, compostos pelo acúmulo intracelular de proteína tau hiperfosforilada. Os déficits cognitivos aparecem e progridem insidiosamente, o comprometimento da memória, especificamente a perda de memória de eventos recentes, é a característica mais frequente da DA e geralmente é sua primeira manifestação. Outros déficits cognitivos aparecem com ou após o desenvolvimento do comprometimento da memória. A disfunção executiva e habilidades visuoespaciais prejudicadas tendem a ser afetadas precocemente, enquanto déficits na função da linguagem e sintomas comportamentais geralmente se manifestam mais tarde. Os sintomas neuropsiquiátricos e comportamentais são comuns nos estágios intermediários e tardios da DA, mas podem ocorrer no início do curso em alguns pacientes. Os déficits neurológicos não cognitivos, sinais motores piramidais e extrapiramidais, mioclonias e convulsões podem ocorrer nos estágios finais da DA, mas são incomuns nos estágios iniciais e intermediários. As apresentações atípicas incluem uma variante visual (atrofia cortical posterior), uma variante com afasia progressiva e uma variante com disfunção executiva progressiva como sintoma predominante. As apresentações atípicas são mais comuns em pessoas mais jovens com DA. A DA é inexoravelmente progressiva, mas a taxa de progressão pode variar. A expectativa média de vida após o diagnóstico foi relatada entre 8 e 10 anos, mas pode variar de 3 a 20 anos. A DA deve ser suspeitada em qualquer idoso com início insidioso, declínio progressivo da memória e pelo menos um outro domínio cognitivo que leve ao funcionamento prejudicado.",

The presence and the degree of awareness is most difficult to assess and causes moral and legal controversies concerning the management of persistent vegetative state. The absence of the perceptual awareness may be the most important clinical characterization for diagnosis. Differential diagnosis includes coma, brain death, locked-in syndrome and minimally responsive state. The pressure of economical factors (managed care) on medical care makes this problem even more complicated.",

      "title": "Lifestyle medicine for depression",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of depression appears to have increased over the past three decades. While this may be an artefact of diagnostic practices, it is likely that there are factors about modernity that are contributing to this rise. There is now compelling evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these factors can potentially be modified, yet they receive little consideration in the contemporary treatment of depression, where medication and psychological intervention remain the first line treatments. “Lifestyle Medicine” provides a nexus between public health promotion and clinical treatments, involving the application of environmental, behavioural, and psychological principles to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. This may also provide opportunities for general health promotion and potential prevention of depression. In this paper we provide a narrative discussion of the major components of Lifestyle Medicine, consisting of the evidence-based adoption of physical activity or exercise, dietary modification, adequate relaxation/sleep and social interaction, use of mindfulness-based meditation techniques, and the reduction of recreational substances such as nicotine, drugs, and alcohol. We also discuss other potential lifestyle factors that have a more nascent evidence base, such as environmental issues (e.g. urbanisation, and exposure to air, water, noise, and chemical pollution), and the increasing human interface with technology. Clinical considerations are also outlined. While data supports that some of these individual elements are modifiers of overall mental health, and in many cases depression, rigorous research needs to address the long-term application of Lifestyle Medicine for depression prevention and management. Critically, studies exploring lifestyle modification involving multiple lifestyle elements are needed. While the judicious use of medication and psychological techniques are still advocated, due to the complexity of human illness/wellbeing, the emerging evidence encourages a more integrative approach for depression, and an acknowledgment that lifestyle modification should be a routine part of treatment and preventative efforts.",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

      "abstract": "In patients with consequences of a stroke, disturbances in motor, cognitive, and sensory functions are observed; cardiovascular, endocrine and other body systems, impairment of self-care and independent walking. Physical dependence, the inability to self-care in fulfilling urgent biological needs leads to a feeling of helplessness and is accompanied by depressive, neurotic reactions to the disease. Restoration of impaired functions after a stroke has a long period and the success of recovery depends, on the one hand, on the volume and location of the brain lesion, the severity of motor and cognitive impairments, on the other hand, on the position of the patient himself, the attitude of the patient’s personality to the disease and adherence to treatment. A patient’s stay in a hospital is associated with the social expectations of the staff for certain behavior of the patient: fulfilling the instructions of the attending physician, partnership with staff (physical therapy methodologist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, etc.), the patient’s activity, the formation of healthy lifestyle attitudes (giving up smoking, alcohol, fatty food, etc.), which can be called psychological conditions for rehabilitation. However, not all patients are ready to fulfill these rehabilitation conditions, which are targets for psychological correction. The tasks of psychological assistance should be focused on developing adherence to treatment, forming cooperative relationships with staff, and healthy lifestyle attitudes, which can contribute to restorative treatment and the prevention of recurrent stroke. Psychological assistance during individual and group work should be focused on providing emotional support, setting realistic and understandable goals for the patient, adequate to the patient’s capabilities, both in a hospital and clinic, which can ensure his active inclusion in the treatment process.",

Se analizan los mecanismos de autodestruccion, sobre todo en lo referente al manejo de la agresion interna y externa, que pueden estar influidos por el consumo de bebidas alcoholicas, y que culminen en conductas suicidas. Se plantea la relacion que existe entre los trastornos psicoticos y el riesgo de suicidio, sobre todo en las etapas avanzadas del padecimiento en las que aparece perdida de la introspeccion como consecuencia de un gran deterioro intelectual y del menoscabo de la memoria. Inicialmente puede presentarse una marcada depresion con ideas suicidas. Finalmente, se describe el papel que desempeno la ingestion de alcohol en 80 suicidios consumados, de los cuales el 55% (44 personas) bebian alcohol. De este porcentaje, el 43% resulto ser de alcoholicos, de acuerdo con la escala de preocupacion por el consumo de alcohol, de Jackson. Asimismo, es de tomarse en consideracion el indice de problemas relacionados con la ingestion de bebidas alcoholicas en los suicidas que estaban preocupados por su consumo de alcohol, debido a que de los 19 alcoholicos, 17 tenian diversos tipos de problemas, sobre todo de indole familiar, laboral y de salud.",

      "title": "ECT: An Effective Treatment in the Screaming Demented Patient",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—As a tertiary inpatient geriatric psychiatry program, we are often exposed to a common treatment dilemma, the screaming demented patient. Very little has been published in this area. The studies reporting on agitation are mostly medical descriptions and pharmacologic trials, with verbal agitation being included under the broader symptom cluster of physical or behavioral agitation.1,2 Agitation is usually poorly defined, and in no studies was verbal agitation considered as a separate variable. As a whole, the medication trials achieved only limited degrees of success. Experience dictates that these successes are often more than offset by medication side-effects and drug toxicity, thus further complicating the patient's presentation and course.3 Partly owing to this lack of effective treatment, Fogel4 suggested the need for further investigation of ECT in the screaming demented patient. Verbal agitation (needless, unstimulated screaming, yelling, moaning) occurs in many psychiatric conditions common to the elderly—delirium, dementia and depression. It is unclear whether this is the result of a common final neurochemical pathway or of differing etiologies in the different conditions.5 We wish to report on a small series of three elderly, verbally agitated patients who showed a dramatic improvement in this symptom with bilateral ECT. In none of these patients was ECT the initial treatment modality employed; neuroleptics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines were tried unsuccsssfully first. One patient clearly met the criteria for major depression and had a past history of ECT-responsive mood disorder. In the other two patients, there was no clear history of major depression either past or current; both had a substantial degree of cognitive impairment. All three patients, exhibited rapid resolution of their screaming behaviour early in their course of ECT. These pilot results suggest some interesting directions. Assuming response to ECT, this might support the hypothesis that screaming in dementia may be a presentation of depression where the other symptoms may be difficult to elicit. On the other hand, the response may suggest a specific response to electrotherapy. Irrespective of the mechanism, ECT appears to provide the possibility of effective therapy in the demented patient who screams and could provide an alternative to the more traditional approach of endless trials of progressively more toxic psychotropic drugs, singly and in combination, with poor outcome and potentially devastating toxicity.",

En la infancia se utilizan los psicoestimulantes para tratar una enfermedad, con lo que en sentido estricto se utilizan exclusivamente como terapia.

El aumento del uso de psicoestimulantes en la infancia seria un caso de medicalizacion. Este uso cada vez mas frecuente en la infancia tendria un efecto normalizador, de uso cotidiano. En la adolescencia y edad adulta, con dificultad para mantener o establecer el diagnostico de TDAH, se podria usar con criterios diferentes, de automedicacion con la finalidad de mejoramiento.

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3). Undertreatment of symptoms has become a major health problem in its own right.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol-related problems are prevalent and lead to substantial economic, physical, and psychological burden. Among the various effects of alcohol, the effect on the brain is a matter of importance. The brain controls drinking behaviors and may be damaged earlier than other organs by alcohol. Moreover, alcohol-related brain pathologies are difficult to treat once they have progressed. Therefore, we overviewed the mechanisms and results of alcohol-induced brain damage and interventions against it in this article. Alcohol exerts neurotoxic effects mediated by various mechanisms, such as acetaldehyde toxicity, glutamate excitotoxicity, increased oxidative stress, and chronic inflammatory responses. In both functional and structural neuroimaging studies, the evidence of alcohol-induced brain damage was observed in various regions of gray and white matter. Brain damage has been known to be more prominent when it begins during the period of brain development and in women. Symptomatically, alcohol hangovers and alcohol-induced blackouts, which are highly prevalent alcohol-related problems, have been suggested to be early signs of alcohol-related brain damage. However, neurological changes induced by alcohol have been reported to be partly recovered by abstinence. The development of effective interventions would be clinically important. Although following the rules of low-risk drinking and abstinence have been the primary approaches up to the present, studies on mechanism-based neuroprotective interventions, such as acamprosate and memantine, have attempted. Further prospective and well-designed studies of neuroprotective interventions against neurotoxic effects of alcohol are required.",

If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream.

      "title": "Intoxicants",
      "abstract": "Drug abuse is underrecognized in most patient populations. Approximately 5\" of the adult population in the world uses an illicit drug, and 1\" of adults use prescription opioids. Drugs causing intoxications can in general be divided into three groups: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Opioids act through a mu receptor present in the central nervous system. Drugs like dilaudid, morphine, methadone, and heroin all belong to the opioid family. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their activity on the postsynaptic membrane. Withdrawal from marijuana presents with mild symptoms or irritability, depression, insomnia, nausea, and anorexia. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance. Intoxication presentation may vary and include talkative, flirtatious, aggressive, moody, or disinhibited behaviors. Intoxicated patients may not be competent enough to make reasonable decisions in terms of their medical care as well as pose a potential danger to self and others.",

      "abstract": "Stwardnienie rozsiane (SM) to choroba powodująca powstawanie obszarów demielizacyjnych w centralnym układzie nerwowym, czego skutkiem mogą być objawy takie, jak: zaburzenia chodu, koordynacji, zaburzenia czucia, ból, zaburzenia wzroku, funkcji seksualnych czy funkcji kognitywnych. Udowodniono, że dysfunkcje seksualne występują u osób chorujących na SM często. Dysfunkcje te występują częściej niż w przypadku pacjentów cierpiących na inne przewlekłe choroby – 70% pacjentów ze stwardnieniem rozsianym dotkniętych jest problemami w sferze seksualnej. Patofizjologia tych zaburzeń jest wieloczynnikowa. Jednym z czynników są uszkodzenia w centralnym układzie nerwowym, innym współistniejące zaburzenia niezwiązane bezpośrednio z obszarami demielizacyjnymi, takie jak: zmęczenie, spastyczność, osłabienie siły mięśni czy skutki uboczne wdrożonej w procesie leczenia farmakoterapii. Należy podkreślić, że część dysfunkcji seksualnych u osób z SM ma podłoże psychologiczne i społeczne. Celem artykułu jest określenie medycznych i społecznych aspektów powstawania zaburzeń seksualnych u osób ze stwardnieniem rozsianym oraz zobrazowanie wpływu dysfunkcji seksualnych na funkcjonowanie jednostki w obrębie społeczeństwa.",

      "abstract": "Spasticity is a source of disability for the hemiplegic patient. It leads to various disorders influencing the quality of gait: at the lower limb varus equinus foot deformity, toe-claw and/or hip adduction with adductors spasticity. At the upper limb, flexion deformity of the wrist and the hand makes grasp and grip ineffective and spasticity of the Pectoralis Major muscle is considered as a main cause of sympathetic dystrophy. Neurolysis with alcohol injection in the nerve trunk or at the motor point destroys the gamma fibers and reduces spasticity, without impairing motor command. The effects on spasticity, motricity, and deformity of 33 chemical neurolysis with alcohol are analysed with a six months follow-up (27 hemiplegic patients, 28 to 62 years old, mean = 54.5). The authors have used 60% alcohol concentration. Sciatic nerve injection significantly reduces triceps spasticity (7/11), improves the range motion of the ankle, and allows the patient to take off the ankle device. Those fair results are still present at the fourth month after injection. Similar results are reported after injection of the obturator nerve for hip adduction deformity (2/3), median nerve injection for wrist and hand deformity (6/6). Pectoralis Major injection in the motor point is effective for 10 of the 13 cases, preventing sympathetic reflex dystrophy or contributing to its dramatic improvement.",

      "abstract": "1. Puberty and adolescence mainly can have a bad effect on idiopathic generalized epilepsies. This can show up in the first onset of seizures in adolescence, e.g. as a form of idiopathic grand mal on awakening, juvenile absence epilepsy or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (impulsive petit mal). Also, already diagnosed absence epilepsy can become worse, e.g. by recurring absence seizures or grand mal seizures or the new onset of grand mal on awakening. 2. Exogenous factors, like changing the time of sleeping and waking, lack of sleep and the abuse of alcohol, play an important role in these types of epilepsy. Cutting out these factors is just as important as the consequent drug treatment on a longterm basis. 3. Drug treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsy will be done with valproate, barbiturates and ethosuximide. Regarding fatal complications of liver function, which are more frequent than previously thought of, valproate can be recommended as a drug of first choice, especially in early childhood and when a combination of drugs is used. 4. A very good effect of adolescence is seen in children with benign idiopathic focal epilepsy with a centro-temporal spike focus. Antiepileptic treatment with carbamazepine as an agent of first choice can be done less vigorously. 5. Menstruation usually only modifies but does not worsen the natural course of epilepsy. There is still no real therapeutical plan for this rare form of epilepsy. 6. It cannot be a general rule, not to change current medical treatment before or during puberty in order to avoid any worsening of seizures. A decision always has to be made regarding the form of epilepsy and the individual situation, which has to be discussed with the patient and perhaps his family.",

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

      "abstract": "Abuse of alcohol (ethanol) and abuse of an increasing number of drugs (e.g. analgesics and sedatives) are among the outstanding social and medical problems of many industrialized countries including Switzerland. Since alcohol consumption has profound effects on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of a variety of drugs, the rational use of drugs in alcoholics is an increasingly difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of the physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic and toxic actions of alcohol. Clinically the most important targets of alcohol action are the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), both of which are frequently involved in the mediation of potentially fatal interactions between drugs and alcohol. In practice the most important of these interactions include (a) inhibition of hepatic (cytochrome P450 dependent) drug oxidation by acute alcohol ingestion resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs that are predominantly excreted by hepatic metabolism, (b) inhibition of acetaldehydedehydrogenase by some drugs with production of an acute flushing reaction to alcohol, (c) increased sensitivity of the CNS to a variety of sedative drugs following acute alcohol ingestion leading to enhanced CNS toxicity of most psychoactive drugs, (d) stimulation of hepatic drug oxidation and decreased CNS sensitivity to sedatives after chronic alcohol abuse, thus explaining the metabolic and pharmacodynamic tolerance of these patients towards psychoactive agents, and (e) depressed drug metabolism and increased CNS sensitivity to sedative and hypnotic drugs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The mechanisms and practical consequences of the clinically most important influences of acute and chronic alcohol ingestion on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic actions of drugs are outlined.",

      "title": "Sialorrhea: a review of a vexing, often unrecognized sign of oropharyngeal and esophageal disease.",
      "abstract": "Saliva is produced by the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual), as well as several smaller glands. Salivary flow can be altered by multiple entities. There is much written regarding xerostomia (\"dry mouth\"), the condition related to inhibited or decreased salivary flow. This condition is widely recognized in certain systemic diseases, particularly Sjögren syndrome, diabetes mellitus, after anticholinergic, antihistamine, and decongestant medications, as well as states of enhanced sympathetic drive, such as anxiety or emotional disturbances and various other psychosocial conditions. On the other hand, sialorrhea or ptyalism, the condition of increased salivary flow, is rarely discussed in the clinical literature. Sialorrhea can occur with various neurologic disorders, infections, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, heavy metal poisoning, Wilson disease, Angelman syndrome, as well as a relatively unknown condition called idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea. Normal salivation may be altered by drugs (such as clozapine, risperidone, nitrazepam, lithium, and bethanecol) that have a cholinergic effect that induces sialorrhea. This report focuses on sialorrhea as it relates to disorders of the oropharynx and esophagus. The patient typically recognizes a problem with excessive \"foamy mucus\" but does not understand its origin. Infections and obstruction are the most common oropharyngeal causes. Increased salivary flow occurs as a typically subtle manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This occurrence is referred to as water brash. Idiopathic achalasia and megaesophagus due to the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are regularly associated with sialorrhea. Esophageal obstruction (foreign body, cancer, or stricture formation), infection, and nasogastric intubation are the more common conditions associated with the symptomatic sequelae of sialorrhea. Sialorrhea-related respiratory and pulmonary complications are greatest in those with a diminished sensation of salivary flow and hypopharyngeal retention. Extremes of age, the chronically debilitated, or those in chronic care facilities, especially associated with cerebrovascular accidents and esophageal cancer, typically comprise this population. For the patient with an intact awareness of saliva, sialorrhea can present with significant social stigmas. Occult drooling or regular oral evacuation into a tissue or \"spit cup\" is socially incapacitating. This report provides a review of the physiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic options for sialorrhea. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should recognize the importance of sialorrhea as a possible indicator or complication of a variety of disease states of the oropharynx and esophagus as well as its impact on the patient's physical and social quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The new DSM-5 has a number of changes to addictions and substance-related disorders. Internet Gaming for instance is a “Condition for Further Study”. This means that it is not an “official” disorder in the DSM, but one on which the American Psychiatric Association request additional research. The DSM diagnostic criteria for addictions to the X-subject generally include: – repetitive use of X, that leads to significant issues with functioning; – preoccupation or obsession with X; – craving/withdrawal symptoms when not dealing with X; – the person has tried to stop or curb X, but has failed to do so; – the person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies; – a person has had continued overuse of X even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person's life; – the person uses X to relieve anxiety related to other issues; – the person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of X. I suggest that some sport fans may: – meet the above mentioned criteria; – be subject to over-identification with “their team performances”, superstitious conditioning and loss of self-consciousness that may lead to a full blown addictive syndrome, along with comorbidity with pathological gambling. This seems particularly true in Italy, for example, as far as the phenomenon of ultra football supporters is concerned. I argue that further research might be needed to explore the psycho-social consequences of obsessive sport addiction and how this may impact on a person's overall functioning.",

      "title": "Acute and Long-Term Effects of Cannabis Use: A Review",
      "abstract": "Cannabis remains the most commonly used and trafficked illicit drug in the world. Its use is largely concentrated among young people (15- to 34-year-olds). There is a variety of cannabis use patterns, ranging from experimental use to dependent use. Men are more likely than women to report both early initiation and frequent use of cannabis. Due to the high prevalence of cannabis use, the impact of cannabis on public health may be significant. A range of acute and chronic health problems associated with cannabis use has been identified. Cannabis can frequently have negative effects in its users, which may be amplified by certain demographic and/or psychosocial factors. Acute adverse effects include hyperemesis syndrome, impaired coordination and performance, anxiety, suicidal ideations/tendencies, and psychotic symptoms. Acute cannabis consumption is also associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes, especially fatal collisions. Evidence indicates that frequent and prolonged use of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Chronic effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Keywords: Cannabis, marijuana, cannabinoids, dependence, addiction, THC, acute effects, long-term effects, and cannabis use disorders.",

      "abstract": "Extáze, MDMA (3,4-methylendioxymetamfetamin) je syntetická, psychoaktivní látka, chemicky podobná stimulanciu metamfetaminu a halucinogenu meskalinu. MDMA uplatňuje svůj účinek především v mozku na neuronech, které používají ke komunikaci s jinými neurony serotonin. Serotoninový systém hraje významnou úlohu při regulaci nálady, agresivity, sexuální aktivity, spánku a citlivosti na bolest. Výzkumy na zvířatech ukazují, že MDMA má neurotoxický účinek; zda to platí také pro člověka, je v současné době intenzivně studováno. MDMA může být nebezpečná a vzácně může způsobit i smrt. Ve vysokých dávkách narušuje MDMA schopnost těla regulovat teplotu. To může vést k rychlému zvýšení tělesné teploty (hypertermie) a způsobit selhání jater, ledvin a kardiovaskulárního systému. Konzumenti MDMA tak čelí stejnému nebezpečí jako konzumenti jiných stimulancií jako je kokain nebo amfetaminy. Tyto zvyšují srdeční frekvenci a krevní tlak, což může být nebezpečné zejména pro osoby s oběhovými problémy a nemocemi srdce, a vyvolávají i další symptomy jako svalové napětí, nechtěné svírání zubů, nucení ke zvracení, rozmazané vidění, mdloby, třesavku a pocení.",

The extreme aversion of men leads to non-marriage, prostitution, multiple psychological and psychopathic crimes, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder which may lead to suicide, The victims in most cases are forced to silence the crime for several reasons including: fear of family disintegration, loss of the breadwinner, fear of loss of love and gifts from the offender, fear of the negative social outlook of the family ... etc. Keywords : Case Study, Incest, Victim, perpetrator, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc. In questo senso la diagnosi e la terapia (farmacologica o psicoterapica) sono di stretta competenza psichiatrica ed utili per la comprensione della criminalita ma non sufficienti perche non costituiscono gli unici fattori causali.",

      "abstract": "Taking opiates for medical purposes without supervision of healthcare professionals and non-medical purposes can cause different consequences such as delirium or even injury, and may cause addiction over a longer period of time. The most common recreational opium is heroin, while opium is rarely used. Opiate groups include opium, morphine, heroin, methadone and codeine. Addiction is manifested through physical and psychological dependence. Physical or biological dependence refers to the change in the biological state of the organism, while psychic addiction implies the forced necessity of entering the substance into the organism in order to restore good mood and to avoid the suffering of certain substances. Addiction leads to acute intoxication characterized by euphoria, facial redness, pruritus, impaired breathing depth, hypotension and bradycardia. Apart from the symptoms of acute intoxication, the use of opiates can lead to serious and even lethal consequences such as neurological diseases, hepatitis, HIV and AIDS. Treatment of opiate dependence implies treatment with naloxone and clinical treatment. Very important for the treatment of overexpression is to determine tolerance to opiates to determine the required dose of the drug. In the Republic of Croatia, the legal framework for the fight against drug abuse is based on the Criminal Code and the Law on Combating Drug Abuse, while at the European Union level the National Strategy for the Suppression of Drug Abuse in the Republic of Croatia was adopted. This research was carried out in order to determine the existence of differences in urban and rural addicts with regard to social demographic characteristics.Research has shown that addicts in urban areas are equally to addicts in rural areas by the time of arrival to the drogs band that addicts in urban and rural areas relatively early start with addiction treatment. The study included 57 respondents divided by sex and area of residence. From the data on opiate abuse by observing the most addicted counties, it is represented in Zagreb and Zagreb County, followed by Istrian and Krapina-Zagorje County. Heptane is the most widely used main source consumed in the city of Zagreb.",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

Patients with life-limiting illnesses often have multiple comorbidities and might be on many medications. Effective treatment always depends on making as precise a diagnosis as possible (e.g. pharmacological management of nausea and vomiting is guided by the presumed mechanism). Symptoms can also herald an emergency (e.g. sepsis, delirium, spinal cord compression), when the patient’s frailty, likely prognosis, and own values and wishes need to be taken into account in planning management.

      "abstract": "The following practical issues in psychopharmacotherapy of patients with mental retardation (MR) or other developmental disability (DD) are discussed, with some theoretical speculations: Persons with MR/DD have high rates of psychiatric disorders/symptoms, many of which are drug-responsive and not satisfactorily treated with other modalities alone. However, diagnosis is often complicated by concurrent multiple disorders (both psychiatric and medical/surgical), masking or distortion of symptoms, and communication impairments. Comorbidity and associated treatments should be considered in medication choice. Compared to psychiatric patients of normal IQ, patients with MR may be more sensitive to side effects and toxicity as well as responsive to lower doses, possibly related to less neuronal substrate, qualitative brain differences, or developmental stage. Unexpected or disappointing drug responses may also be related to such statistical quirks as \"end-of-curve\" phenomena. Ripples, ratcheting, and other ecobehavioral considerations influence treatment outcome and drug management. Target symptoms and expected drug benefits should be defined in consultation with caregivers as well as, when possible, the patient. Because drug responses of patients with MR are especially unpredictable, unreliable, sensitive to dose, and fraught with side effects, each medication trial might ideally be approached as a single-subject experiment on a compassionate protocol: quantify the baseline with ratings, behavior counts or other objective measures; start low and titrate slowly; monitor progress with repeated objective measures.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

The term, “sui generis,” emphasizes this. Addiction involves an intense focus on using, with a motivational salience to use frequently, and to engage in associated behavior, cognition, and conation -- to the point that it takes over the user’s life, superceding common sense, reasonable judgment, and acceptable behavior. Addiction is usually accompanied by physical dependence, but is not the same thing: that is, using to avoid withdrawal is not the same as using to gratify addictive craving. But physical dependence or other motivations may appear as “pseudo-addiction.” Addictive craving is not a psychological derivative of other motivations (though an addict will say otherwise). In its pathogenesis, occasional alcohol or drug use becomes routine. Then, regular use becomes a turning point for many, toward addiction.",

SCT is positively associated with ADHD inattentive symptoms, depression, anxiety, and daytime sleepiness, but is unassociated or negatively associated with externalizing behaviours such as hyperactivity-impulsivity, oppositionality, and aggression. A growing body of research also demonstrates that SCT is uniquely associated with poorer functioning in various domains of major life activities, including academic difficulties (including poor organization, homework problems, and lower grade point average), social problems (especially peer withdrawal and isolation), and emotion dysregulation. SCT is less clearly associated with most neuropsychological performance outcomes with the possible exceptions of sustained attention, processing speed, and motor speed.",

Di Indonesia terdapat antara 2-3juta orang yang pernah menghisap ganja. Penggunaan ganja dapat menyebabkan penyakit fisik (gangguan pernafasan dan kardiovaskuler) maupun mental (gangguan psikotik). Penggunaan ganja secara teratur terkait dengan munculnya gejala psikotik seperti pemikiran tidak teratur (disorganized), halusinasi, dan delusi. Umumnya para pengguna menggunakan beberapa zat, tetapi pada kasus ini hanya menggunakan satu zat saja yaitu ganja. Pada laporan ini, kami menyampaikan kasus lelaki umur 30 tahun yang mengonsumsi ganja sejak usia 17 tahun didiagnosis dengan gangguan mental dan perilaku akibat penggunaan zat multipel dan penggunaan zat psikoaktif lainnya dengan sindrom ketergantungan (F19.2) dan episode depresi sedang dengan gejala somatik (F32.11). Pasien mengalami halusinasi visual dan auditorik. Pasien mendapat terapi clozapine 25 miligram tiap 12 jam intraoral. Kasus diatas dapat disimpulkan bahwa penggunaan ganja secara kontinu memicu terjadinya psikotik.Dependence and substance abuse is not a new problem in Indonesia.

Among 2-3 million people in Indonesia have smoked cannabis. The use of cannabis can cause physical illness (respiratory and cardiovascular disorders) as well as mental (psychotic disorders). Regular use of cannabis is associated with the emergence of psychotic symptoms such as disorganized thinking, hallucinations, and delusions. Generally users use some substance, but in this case only use oneÂ substance that is marijuana. In this report we present the case of 30-year-old man who consumed marijuana since the age of 17 years was diagnosed with mental and behavioral disorders due to multiple substances use and other psychoactive substance use with addiction syndrome (F19.2) and episodes of severely depressed somatic symptoms (F32.11). The patient experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. Patients were given 25 milligrams of clozapine therapy every 12 hours intraoral. From this case can be concluded that the continuous use of cannabis trigger the occurrence of psychotic.",

      "abstract": "L’alcoolo-dépendance est une maladie chronique hautement récidivante dont l’enjeu principal est la prévention des rechutes. Les rechutes sont favorisées par le ressenti du sujet vis-à-vis de son environnement social [1]. L’alcoolo-dépendance entraîne des troubles cognitivo-comportementaux dont des déficits de reconnaissance émotionnelle et une altération des interactions sociales [2] majorant le risque de rechutes [3]. Ces troubles pourraient être liés à une altération du sentiment de familiarité. La familiarité se définit comme un sentiment de connaissance préalable d’un stimulus générant une émotion inconsciente, sans souvenir conscient de son identité [4]. Nous nous proposons d’étudier la familiarité aux visages dans l’alcoolo-dépendance. Douze patients alcoolo-dépendants (AD) étaient appariés en sexe et en âge à 12 témoins (T). Les participants ne présentaient ni trouble psychiatrique, ni neurologique, ni addiction en dehors d’un trouble d’usage sévère d’alcool pour le groupe AD (classification DSM-5). Des morphes entre visages familiers et inconnus (contenant 5 à 95 % du visage familier) étaient présentés. Les sujets devaient indiquer les visages leur semblant familiers. Un pourcentage de réponse « familier » était alors calculé par niveau de familiarité, permettant de construire une fonction psychométrique par sujet, et d’en déduire le seuil de familiarité (pourcentage de familiarité contenue dans le morphe pour lequel 50 % des stimuli étaient considérés comme familiers). Les interactions sociales étaient évaluées par une échelle de cognition sociale (MASC). Le seuil de familiarité était significativement plus faible dans le groupe AD que dans le groupe T (48,79 % versus 54,94 % – p = 0,025). Parallèlement les 2 groupes différaient sur les scores au MASC (AD : 26/45 ; T : 31/45 – p = 0,015). Ces résultats démontrent une hyperfamiliarité dans l’alcoolo-dépendance, associée à une altération de la cognition sociale. L’implication de l’altération de ces deux processus sur les risques de rechute est abordée.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

Inspection of the Glasgow Coma Scale (See Box 1.3) will show that a minor degree of altered consciousness results in ‘confusion’ even although the patient remains ambulant and able to obey commands. A further deterioration in consciousness results in a verbal response described as ‘inappropriate words’. This commonly means that the patient is abusive and uses offensive language. This is usually a transient phenomenon requiring little active intervention but it is of the greatest importance that those responsible for dealing with head-injured patients realize that this behaviour indicates altered consciousness and not simply antisocial behaviour or drunkenness.",

Delirium can be precipitated by any somatic factor, which includes a variety of different illnesses, surgery, or substance (medication) intoxication or withdrawal. Predisposing factors are higher age and cognitive and functional impairment, among others. A final common pathway seems to be the most plausible for this multifactorial syndrome. The current leading candidate for the final pathway is the neurotransmitter state of relative acetylcholine deficiency and dopamine excess, together with an exaggerated inflammatory cascade. Although prevention of delirium should be the main aim, treatment consists of non-pharmacologic measures, reversing the precipitating conditions, and judicious use of antipsychotics in severely agitated patients only. Delirium is independently associated with an increase in mortality, impaired physical and cognitive recovery, and increased hospital costs.",

At the same time, some specific epileptic syndromes were indicated by the eponym of the first physician who originally described the condition (e.g., West syndrome, Dravet syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome) or by some characteristic clinical features (e.g., nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, absence epilepsy, epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females). In many of these occurrences, the distinct epileptic syndrome was defined mainly by its most relevant clinical feature (e.g., seizure semiology), associated comorbidities, and electroencephalographic patterns.[3] [4]",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

The disease is often manifested as perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. Positive symptoms refer to abnormal or hyperactive mental functions, including abnormal sensations (visual and auditory hallucinations), delusions, confused thoughts, disorganized speech and behavior, etc. Negative symptoms refer to reduced or absent mental functions, including lack of motivation, lack of pleasure, social withdrawal, reduced willpower, etc. Cognitive deficits include impaired attention, decline in executive function and working memory, etc. Although the use of chlorpromazine in 1950 cured or alleviated the psychiatric symptoms of most SCZ patients, there were still 20% of the patients who were drug-resistant or dissatisfied with psychotropic treatments. So far, SCZ treatment mainly includes medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychotherapy, and rTMS treatment.",

      "title": "Mood Stabilizers in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

      "abstract": "The negative effect of toxic chemicals and drugs on the kidneys leads to nephrotoxicity due to a disturbance of the physiological regulation functions such as the hydro-saline and acid-base equilibrium, detoxification of metabolic intermediates, and elimination of drugs and toxic metabolites. The nephrotoxic effect is more predominant in patients with kidney disease and may be manifested by acute or chronic renal failure with disruption of the processes of filtration, secretion, reabsorption and concentration of urine. The symptoms of kidney failure are various and in most cases depend on the nature of the nephrotoxics. The most common symptoms include azotemia, increased serum urea, hematuria, anemia, proteinuria, albuminuria, acidosis, edema, hepatomegaly, ascites to convulsions, and coma. The range of nephrotoxic substances is quite varied and numerous, and includes: drugs, solvents, pesticides, herbicides, alcohols, fuels, mushrooms, plants. A special aspect is represented by the antimicrobial drugs such as: antibiotics (aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, ansamycins, polymyxins, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, penicillins), sulfamides, fluoroquinolones, antifungals, antivirals etc.",

In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

According to it, anxiety is conceptualized as a negative or unpleasant emotion characterized by subjective distress, high physiological activation, unadapted motor responses; at the same time, anxiety is linked to individual differences in certain situational areas (specific traits). Anxiety reactions appear due to subject perceives that a certain situation seems threating (situation's appraisal), with no apparent solution due to a lack of resources (coping abilities). For somebody, certain consummatory behaviors such as eating, alcohol consumption, smoking, or drug abuse could relieve distress symptoms or reduce physiological activation producing by anxiety. However, such consumption behaviors could become more and more necessary in order to alleviate anxiety symptoms or avoiding the withdrawal, which is a clinical syndrome including intense anxiety manifestations. The possibility to stop the consumption is interpreted as a threatening situation which provokes more anxiety; the only coping response available is to maintain consumption. Regarding addiction treatments, there are significant interactions between type of treatment x type of patient. Anxiety is on of the variables evaluated in order to design more effective treatments matched with the characteristics of the patient.",

La contenzione fisica, come implica la definizione, sono le modalita che limitano i movimenti dell’ospite e non possono essere da lui facilmente rimossi. Si ha la contenzione chimica, quando farmaci tranquillanti, sedativi e antidepressivi sono usati senza indicazioni adeguate o per periodi eccessivi di tempo. Nelle istituzioni geriatriche il ricorso al loro uso sembra essere eccessivo, gli ospiti anziani sono spesso in contenzione senza una chiara direttiva medica e per motivazioni non sempre corrette. Da un esame della letteratura e dell’esperienza clinica, gli Autori evidenziano come i mezzi di contenzione non solo non raggiungono quei risultati previsti nelle motivazioni addotte per il loro uso, ma possono comportare effetti collaterali dannosi quale la diminuzione del tono muscolare, ulcere da pressione, disturbi circolari, e anche la morte. Da un punto di vista etico legare l’ospite anziano assume costantemente connotazioni negative e suggerisce sempre privazioni di autonomia, annullamento della persona. Se e quando la contenzione deve essere adottata, questo deve avvenire dopo che si siano esaminati tutti gli interventi alternativi possibili, e deve essere sempre prescritta da un medico ed accuratamente registrata sia per la modalita usata la meno coercitiva possibile che per il tempo che si rende necessaria. Se ne dovrebbero considerare le indicazioni, le controindicazioni, l’efficacia e la sicurezza, gli effetti indesiderati esattamente come si fa con un farmaco o con un\r\nintervento chirurgico.

This article presents converging findings from human behavioral research, brain imaging, and basic neuroscience on smoking as self-medication for attentional and emotional dysfunctions. Nicotine and other tobacco constituents have significant effects on neural circuitry underlying the regulation of attention and affect. Age, sex, early environment, and exposure to other drugs have been identified as important factors that moderate both the effects of nicotine on brain circuitry and behavior and the risk for smoking initiation. Findings also suggest that the effects of smoking differ depending on whether smoking is used to regulate attention or affect. Individual differences in the reinforcement processes underlying tobacco use have implications for the development of tailored smoking cessation programs and prevention strategies that include early treatment of attentional and emotional dysfunctions.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Delirium can be conceptualized as an acute decline in cognitive function that typically lasts from hours to a few days. Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

Dementia refers to the clinical condition or syndrome of cognitive impairment that is sufficiently severe to interfere with social and work activities. It is frequently conflated with Alzheimer's disease which is only one, albeit the commonest, of many diseases that can cause dementia. Damage to the blood supply to the brain often resulting in minor strokes, vascular dementia, is less common with the better control of high blood pressure and reduction in smoking. The majority of people living with dementia will have a neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's, characterised by loss of memory. Other causes include dementia with Lewy bodies that overlaps with Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal degeneration. The latter most commonly presents with changes in behaviour such as disinhibition, loss of empathy and stereotypies. It can also present with speech and language deficits. The precise syndromic diagnosis is important for understanding carer burden and may have specific impact on psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Acute Alcohol and Cognition: Remembering What It Causes Us to Forget",
      "abstract": "Addiction has been conceptualized as a specific form of memory that appropriates typically adaptive neural mechanisms of learning to produce the progressive spiral of drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior, perpetuating the path to addiction through aberrant processes of drug-related learning and memory. From that perspective, to understand the development of alcohol use disorders, it is critical to identify how a single exposure to alcohol enters into or alters the processes of learning and memory, so that involvement of and changes in neuroplasticity processes responsible for learning and memory can be identified early. This review characterizes the effects produced by acute alcohol intoxication as a function of brain region and memory neurocircuitry. In general, exposure to ethanol doses that produce intoxicating effects causes consistent impairments in learning and memory processes mediated by specific brain circuitry, whereas lower doses either have no effect or produce a facilitation of memory under certain task conditions. Therefore, acute ethanol does not produce a global impairment of learning and memory, and can actually facilitate particular types of memory, perhaps particular types of memory that facilitate the development of excessive alcohol use. In addition, the effects on cognition are dependent on brain region, task demands, dose received, pharmacokinetics, and tolerance. Additionally, we explore the underlying alterations in neurophysiology produced by acute alcohol exposure that help to explain these changes in cognition and highlight future directions for research. Through understanding the impact that acute alcohol intoxication has on cognition, the preliminary changes potentially causing a problematic addiction memory can better be identified.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

Die Formen motorischer Auffalligkeiten variieren in Phanomenologie, Verlauf und Pathophysiologie, sodass man von mehreren zugrundeliegenden Mechanismen ausgehen muss. Einzelne Symptome haben in bestimmten Erkrankungsstadien pradiktiven Wert fur den Verlauf. Motorische Auffalligkeiten wie Parkinsonismus oder neurologische Soft Signs sind beispielweise mit schlechterer Ausfuhrung von Handgesten, aber auch mit schlechterer Wahrnehmung nonverbaler sozialer Stimuli assoziiert. Storungen der Handgestik als Einschrankungen in der nonverbalen Kommunikation sagen wiederum niedrigeres soziales Funktionsniveau und mehr Negativsymptomatik im Verlauf von 6 Monaten vorher. Einzelnen motorischen Phanomenen und auch der gestorten Gestenproduktion liegen Storungen in motorischen Hirnnetzwerken zugrunde. Relevant sind hier vor allem fronto-parietale Verbindungen sowie Verbindungen zwischen Thalamus und primar sowie sekundar motorischen Kortexarealen. Mittels nicht-invasiver Hirnstimulationsmethoden lassen sich diese motorische Netzwerke prinzipiell modulieren. Erste Ergebnisse einer rTMS Studie weisen darauf hin, dass insbesondere inhibitorische Stimulation des supplementar-motorischen Areals uber 3 Wochen die psychmotorische Verlangsamung zu verbessern vermag. Solche Interventionsstudien sind ebenfalls denkbar zur Verbesserung der Gestenproduktion oder feinmotorischer/koordinativer Storungen bei Schizophrenie.

Substance abuse also refers to their use in order to increase intellectual or physical performance, against the rules established by society. Substance abuse involves the chronic use of non-medical chemicals for hedonistic or entheogenic purposes [1]. Drugs such as alcohol, antidepressants, amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, glue, cocaine, hallucinogens, metacular, narcotics, opiates, sedatives, stimulants and some organic solvents can be named [2]. Substance abuse can cause criminal or antisocial behavior, may generate long-term changes in personality [3]. Cocaine has major toxic effects on the body. Treatment of cocaine poisoning is complex. The main sales are those that can lead to patient death. For the proper treatment of any inoculation, it is necessary to identify the xenobiotic that generated it. The presence of metabolites, in the case of cocaine - ethylbenzoylcogene (EBE), provides information on the time of administration of the xenobiotic. Gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is an optoelectronic method that can identify the presence of cocaine and / or EBE from biological samples. In order to increase the sensitivity of the method, a special mass metrology technique - MS/MS can be used [4, 5].",

There are two primary features of addiction to all forms of natural and pharmacological stimuli. First, the rewarding stimulus associated with the addiction is a compelling motivator of behavior at the expense of behaviors leading to the acquisition of other rewarding stimuli. Thus, individuals come to orient increasing amounts of their daily activity around acquisition of the rewarding stimulus to which they are addicted. Second, there is a persistence of craving for the addictive stimulus, combined with an inability to regulate the behaviors associated with obtaining that stimulus. Thus, years after the last exposure to an addictive stimulus, reexposure to that stimulus or environmental cues associated with that stimulus will elicit behavior seeking to obtain the reward.",

      "abstract": "The legal and illegal use of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and hallucinogens, is markedly increasing. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may cause severe acute or chronic symptoms; one cannot predict adverse reactions or relate them to frequency and length of LSD use. Among its effects are acute psychologic changes, including psychosis; and chronic alterations, such as apathy, psychosis, and \"flashback.\" Chlorpromazine is recommended for treatment of symptoms; psychotherapy and education help prevent further LSD use. Chronic amphetamine use may lead to toxic psychosis, confusion, or brain damage; acute withdrawal may lead to depression, with suicidal ideation, and increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with nightmares and insomnia. Chronic use of barbiturates and nonbarbiturate hypnotics may lead to mental impairment, motor incoordination, and depression. Withdrawal produces weakness, irritability, and occasionally convulsions or psychosis. Amphetamines and hypnotics should be withdrawn gradually and patients educated as to possible physiologic alterations, both those patients dependent on large doses and those who have taken therapeutic doses for some months. Withdrawal of these drugs leads to marked increases in REM sleep, nightmares, and insomnia, which may lead to drug dependency. Marijuana may change time sense and visual and auditory perceptions. Chronic use frequently indicates underlying psychologic disturbances needing psychotherapy. Psychoactive drugs differentially affect responses of various autonomic systems. Central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs do not induce only one condition and cannot be simply classified as excitants or depressants. The physiologic alterations produced by psychoactive drugs are basic to drug dependency as are personality factors.",

The change in mood is accompanied by increased activity or energy as well as other symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased sleep, increased speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, agitation, and increased involvement in risky behaviors. The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed psychiatric history ascertaining the presence of current or previous mood symptoms. Children and adolescents are more likely to present with either rapidly fluctuating or a mixed mood state. Bipolar disorder is associated with high relapse rates, even among those receiving treatment. The first-line medication class is second-generation antipsychotics.

      "title": "Alcohol-related dementia (alcohol-induced dementia; alcohol-related brain damage)",
      "abstract": "Abstract Long-term heavy alcohol consumption causes significant brain abnormalities and impairs cognitive functioning. A number of terms have been used to describe these effects, including: ‘alcohol-related dementia’, ‘alcohol-induced dementia’, and ‘alcoholic dementia’. The more pragmatic umbrella term ‘alcohol-related brain damage’ (ARBD) is also used. The literature is beset with limitations, in particular the lack of a diagnostic gold standard, and the difficulty in making a clinical diagnosis. Many individuals labelled as having an alcohol-related dementia are, in fact, suffering from the Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). (This is a specific neuropathological disease caused by thiamine deficiency, which can occur secondary to alcohol misuse. It is considered in Chapter 4.1.12.) When considering the topic of ‘alcohol-related dementia’ it is probably sensible to take a broad clinically-based diagnostic view that includes both WKS and other cases of ‘dementia’ that appear to be alcohol-related. Alcohol-related dementia should be recognized as a preventable condition. However, identification is hampered by a lack of clarity in terminology, and a lack of standardized and specialized screening instruments and assessment procedures. These individuals make repeated use of Accident and Emergency Departments, general medical, and long stay wards. Early identification would reduce their need for these services. Abstinence is the key to recovery. Treatment services should be integrated and flexible.",

Ictal semiology may vary depending on the etiology, age at onset, and cerebral areas involved in the epileptogenic network. In childhood, EE could manifest as tonic head drop seizures, generalized seizures, or late-onset epileptic spasms. However, in teenagers or adults, seizures are often preceded by aura and commonly manifest as focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities are seen in less than half of the reported cases. Posterior or multifocal interictal discharges can be seen in patients with EE. No randomized data about treatment are available. Structural epilepsies or coexistent unprovoked seizures other than eating seizures are poor prognostic factors for pharmacological outcome.",

As a consequence there is a sharp inhibition of conditioned and, in part, of unconditioned reflexes. Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction. This confirms the presence of cortical inhibition in an arbitrarily induced condition of age or fatigue. If the subject regards himself as being of a younger age or in a more vigorous situation than usual, this will induce a certain increase in the reflexes.",

Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

Motor or phonic tics that persist for more than 1 year are defined as persistent (chronic) tic disorder. Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases.

People with AUD are at risk of experiencing self-stigma, a social-cognitive experience in which people think others hold negative stereotypes about them, expect to be treated unfairly, and/or believe that negative stereotypes are personally accurate. Women in the criminal justice system with AUD in particular are at risk of experiencing self-stigma due to intersecting sources of disadvantage. Given that self-stigma can lead to treatment avoidance and dropout, it is important to understand risk factors for self-stigma to inform prevention and intervention efforts in the justice system. Incarcerated women with AUD (n=185) completed measures of alcohol self-stigma as well as a variety of theoretically relevant risk factors including sociodemographics, baseline levels of stress and depression, and alcohol-related factors (i.e., length of drinking history, frequency/amount of use, consequences of use, physician advice to stop, belief that legal involvement is related to alcohol use, alcohol-related charges, self-efficacy to quit, readiness for treatment, pressures to enter treatment, factors that influence treatment) and other stigmatized conditions (drug use, exchanging sex, and homelessness). Results showed that experiencing more consequences of alcohol use, pressures to enter treatment, and perceived stress were associated with internalized stigma and anticipated/enacted stigma. This study begins to identify which incarcerated women with AUD are most at risk of experiencing self-stigma that may interfere with alcohol treatment.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

This is particularly true for the subset of people who are intrinsically more vulnerable to stressful conditions. Yet the underlying mechanisms for such developmental trajectory from early life insult to aberrant adult behavior remains elusive. Adolescence is a period of dynamic physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes, encompassing a distinct neurodevelopmental stage called the 'critical period'. During adolescence, the brain is uniquely susceptible to stress. Stress mediators may lead to disturbances to biological processes that can cause permanent alterations in the adult stage, even as severe as the onset of mental illness when paired with genetic risk and environmental factors. Understanding the molecular factors governing the critical period and how stress can disturb the maturation processes will allow for better treatment and prevention of late adolescent/young adult onset psychiatric disorders.",

Clinical/neurological examination does not confirm any organic basis for the symptoms. Conversion disorders are more frequent in girls than in boys. They are rarely seen below the age of seven. A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered. Multiprofessional assessment and treatment by a neuropediatrician, physiotherapist, child psychiatrist/psychologist and educational therapist may reduce \"doctor shopping\" and contribute to a favourable outcome.",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

The symptoms in melancholia being of a negative character due to a lowering or suspension of brain activity, we do not look for all those diversities, endless varieties and aspects which we may find in mania, be it simple, acute, or chronic. Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

It is a state of rest for the otherwise active nervous system. It is dened as a state of unconsciousness from which a person can be aroused by appropriate sensory or any other stimulus (1). Sleep duration varies with gender, age and also according to one's daily routine. A lack of sleep, or sleep deprivation (SD), is a widespread phenomenon that can induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. Sleep duration is very important but sleep quality is often ignored factor. Sleep is very essential for learning, memory, attention, alertness, judgement, and overall health of an individual.",

Recent evidence shows that, apart from severe anterograde and retrograde memory deficits, Korsakoff's pathology can include pronounced emotional abnormalities and impairments in executive functioning (e.g., problem solving, cognitive flexibility, set shifting, and task monitoring). Neurological studies have consistently revealed lesions in diencephalic and prefrontal brain areas among KS patients. It is assumed that damage in mammillary regions and the thalamus are determinants of amnesic symptoms, whereas observed executive dysfunctions more likely result from damage in the prefrontal lobe. Future research will more closely examine the causes of brain changes in KS, discerning between the primary neurotoxic effects of alcohol consumption on the one hand, and the secondary effects of malnutrition and/or vitamin deficiencies on the other. A further topic of inquiry will concern symptom specificity in KS, alcohol-addiction, and alcohol-related dementia.",

      "abstract": "Confusion and hallucinations in geriatric patients are frequent symptoms and typically associated with delirium, late-life psychosis or dementia syndromes. A far rarer but well-established differential in patients with rapid cognitive deterioration, acute psychosis, abnormal movements and seizures is autoimmune encephalitis. Exemplified by our case we highlight clinical and economic problems arising in management of geriatric patients with cognitive decline and psychotic symptoms.A 77-year-old female caucasian patient with an unremarkable medical history was hospitalized after a fall in association with diarrhea and hyponatremia. Upon adequate therapy, disorientation and troubled short-term memory persisted. Within a week the patient developed visual hallucinations. Basic blood and urine samples and imaging (cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) were unremarkable. With progressive cognitive decline, amnestic impairment, word finding difficulty and general apathy, psychiatric and neurologic expertise was introduced. Advanced diagnostics did not resolve a final diagnosis; an electroencephalogram showed unspecific generalized slowing. Extended clinical observation revealed visual hallucinations and faciobrachial dystonic seizures. A treatment with anticonvulsants was initiated. Cerebrospinal fluid ultimately tested positive for voltage-gated potassium channel LGl1 (leucine-rich-inactivated-1) antibodies confirming diagnosis of autoimmune anti-LGI1 encephalitis. Immediate immunotherapy (high-dose glucocorticoids and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin G) led to a rapid improvement of the patient's condition. After immunotherapy was tapered, the patient had one relapse and completely recovered with reintroduction of glucocorticoids and initiation of therapy with rituximab.Rapidly progressive dementia in geriatric patients demands a structured and multidisciplinary diagnostic approach. Accurate management and financially supportable care is a major issue in rare diseases such as anti-LGI1-encephalitis. Education and awareness about autoimmune encephalitis of all physicians treating a geriatric population is important in order to involve expertise and establish treatment within reasonable time.",

Some symptoms are clustered into syndromes, and provisional operational criteria, such as AD-related psychosis or depression, are proposed to facilitate their study.4,5 These symptoms have serious negative consequences for patients, including compromising quality of life and increasing impairment in activities of daily living. They are also major sources of psychological stress, depression, and burden for the caregivers.6 Studies have shown that these symptoms are linked to elder abuse and are important determinants of the institutionalization of patients with AD.7,8 Neuropsychiatric symptoms reflect the underlying neurobiological changes of the diseased brain, and many can be alleviated by psychotropic medications.9,10 Certain stage-specific patterns of the neuropsychiatric symptoms can be observed during the course of AD,11 and some symptoms may have specific value in the prediction of the disease course. For example, several studies have found that depression is a harbinger of AD;12,13 others have shown that delusions or hallucinations predict clinical or functional decline.14,15Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes cognitive impairment in the elderly not of sufficient severity to meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. It is often a transitional state between normal aging and dementia. Subjects with MCI have memory impairment or other cognitive deficits that may be noticeable to their family. Objective cognitive tests show worse performance than their age-and education-comparable contemporaries. However, their daily function is generally preserved.",

      "title": "Drug-induced dystonia",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced dystonia (DID) is a rarely diagnosed adverse reaction to a sufficiently large number of drugs. Acute DID (ADID) occurs soon after starting to take a drug or raising its dose, and switching from one antipsychotic medication to another, especially to its injectable dosage form. Tardive DID (TDID) develops a few months or years after starting drug intake or 3 months after stopping therapy. The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is characterized by unilateral or bilateral involuntary movements. Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

The second half explores the story behind the diagnostic terminology used in clinical practice today, and describes the recent changes to the addiction section of the major classificatory systems. Addiction is conceptualised as a disorder involving a loss of the normal flexibility of human behaviour, leaving a dehumanised state of compulsive behaviour (‘overwhelming involvement’). It has acquired a variety of terminology over time, much of it inferring moral weakness. Addiction may be associated with psychoactive substances or other pleasurable behaviours and occurs on a spectrum of use and harms, which vary in severity. The term ‘dependence’ may refer to physiological aspects of addiction (tolerance or withdrawal), but is also used to define the severe end of the spectrum. Confusion around this terminology has led to it being removed from the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5).",

Adolescence is a developmental period when emotions can be extreme when elicited by both positive and negative experiences. The major internalizing disorders are depressive disorders and anxiety disorders; related ones in this domain include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and autism. Treatment effectiveness for teenagers with substance use disorder and a coexisting internalizing disorder is optimized when both domains are addressed. Behavioral-based treatment approaches with concurrent psychotropic medication are part of the treatment plan. One of the most common mental and behavioral disorders among adolescents in the United States is depression. For those suffering from a major depressive disorder, symptoms include a period of at least 2 weeks of a very persistent low mood accompanied with low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, and problems with sleep, energy, and concentration.",

Psychological interventions may explicitly target risk factors for poor outcome, such as substance use, or protective factors, such as adherence to medication, or be directed at specific symptoms or deficits. There is emerging evidence for efficacy of psychological treatments during, following and even prior to the first episode. Important areas for further study are how different treatment modalities can interact productively, and patient and carer preferences for treatment. Many trials of psychological treatments have design flaws and this tends to overestimate the treatment effect.",

B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common mental illness and can be associated with several other comorbidity and aging. Again, aging is highly associated with physical impairment such as mobility issues, ADL/IADL status, and use of supportive devices. Still, there is no such extensive research about the link between depression and chronic health diseases or conditions. So, in this paper, we find the relationship between depression and physical impairments such as mobility problems, ADL/IADL status, and the use of any assist or supporting device(s) as well as to understand the effect of some psychosocial factors on the development of late-life depression.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Developmental Discoordination Disorder (DCD) is an often overlooked and seldom diagnosed neurodevelopmental condition marked by impairments in motor skills. Lacking identifiable medical or neurological etiology, children with DCD often have preserved intellectual abilities. Comorbidity is common, including ADHD and specific learning disability. Despite extensive evidence of significant impact on daily activities and academics due to differences in motor behaviors, DCD difficulties are regularly treated as behavioral problems. Method Neuropsychological evaluation of an 8-year-old boy with a possible reading delay and inability to perform some age-appropriate academic and self-care tasks. Results Average overall ability with very strong verbal performances; intact visual perceptual processing, memory, and non-written language. Academics are within expected range, although graphomotor weakness impacted academic performances on tasks with written demands. Patient appeared clumsy and awkward with low muscle tone, poor balance, and difficulty learning new motor skills. Impaired fine motor control, handwriting, gait, gross motor skills, motor planning, coordination, and oromotor weakness as well as inferior verbal language abilities were evident. Impulsivity, inattention, poor planning, and poor self-monitoring were also evident. Conclusions DCD is evidenced by impairment in fine and gross motor skills, oromotor skills, motor planning, energy, and coordination with clear discrepancy between motor abilities and abilities in other areas, specifically language. In our case, DCD features were overlooked despite wide ranging impact. ADHD and SLD with impairment in written expression were concurrent. This case highlights the need for greater appreciation of DCD so that children can benefit from early detection and intervention considering the life-long implications of the disorder.",

We have conducted a narrative review of neuropsychiatric harms associated with the psychostimulants methamphetamine/amphetamine, cocaine and 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), focusing on epidemiological factors, common clinical presentations, underlying causal mechanisms and treatment options. The major neuropsychiatric harms of psychostimulant use are stroke, neurocognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, seizures and psychotic illness. These arise through a combination of acute monoamine release, longer‐term neurotransmitter effects and indirect effects. These effects are moderated by factors in the individual and in the pattern of substance use. Neuropsychiatric harms associated with psychostimulant use can thus lead to severe long‐term impairment.",

Such conditions are usually accompanied with increase in medications consumption and decline in quality of life. Though usually medical sciences study mental health conditions, sociology also needs to be applied to appraise the \"cause and effect\" of mental health. As life expectancy is globally increasing, more and more people are subject to mental disorders, Alzheimer's disorders, dementia, depression and many more, as the effects of aging extensively impact mental health. Therefore, under the conditions of rapid aging, geriatrics needs to be strengthened and improved as much as possible to safeguard mental health.

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "abstract": "The negative consequences of chronic alcohol abuse are well known, but heavy episodic consumption (“binge drinking”) is also associated with significant personal and societal harms. Aggressive tendencies are increased after alcohol but the mechanisms underlying these changes are not fully understood. While effects on behavioural control are likely to be important, other effects may be involved given the widespread action of alcohol. Altered processing of social signals is associated with changes in social behaviours, including aggression, but until recently there has been little research investigating the effects of acute alcohol consumption on these outcomes. Recent work investigating the effects of acute alcohol on emotional face processing has suggested reduced sensitivity to submissive signals (sad faces) and increased perceptual bias towards provocative signals (angry faces) after alcohol consumption, which may play a role in alcohol-related aggression. Here we discuss a putative mechanism that may explain how alcohol consumption influences emotional processing and subsequent aggressive responding, via disruption of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-amygdala connectivity. While the importance of emotional processing on social behaviours is well established, research into acute alcohol consumption and emotional processing is still in its infancy. Further research is needed and we outline a research agenda to address gaps in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

      "abstract": "In de afgelopen decennia is het gebruik van ADHD medicatie, met name stimulantia, toegenomen. Deze toename leidt regelmatig tot verhit maatschappelijk debat en onrust onder ouders en clinici. De zorgen over ADHD medicatie worden in de media aangewakkerd door suggestieve berichtgeving over de overeenkomsten met harddrugs als cocaine en ecstasy. Terecht vraagt men zich af: willen we onze kinderen blootstellen aan een middel waarvan we het lange-termijn effect op de hersenontwikkeling niet kennen? In dit proefschrift presenteer ik de resultaten van onderzoek naar de lange-termijn effecten van ADHD medicatie op het zich ontwikkelende brein. Vaker dan wel, vinden we geen verband tussen medicatie en de ontwikkeling van het brein. Zo vinden we geen effect van ADHD medicatie op de dikte van de cortex (deze is bij kinderen/jongeren met ADHD vaak wat dunner), op het volume van de frontaalschors (deze is bij kinderen/jongeren met ADHD vaak wat kleiner), of op activatie in het striatum tijdens beloning (deze is bij kinderen/jongeren met ADHD vaak wat verhoogd). Ook wat betreft ADHD symptomen, sociaal-emotioneel functioneren en cognitie vinden we geen lange-termijn effect, positief dan wel negatief, van medicatie. In een aantal studies vinden we echter wel subtiele veranderingen in het brein na behandeling met stimulantia. De frontaalschors, bijvoorbeeld, is kleiner bij jongeren met ADHD, maar niet bij jongeren met ADHD die drager zijn van het DRD4 7R allel en bovendien op jonge leeftijd medicatie hebben gekregen. Ook vinden we dat jongeren die intensief zijn behandeld met stimulantia, wanneer ze een beloning krijgen, een hersengebied activeren dat belangrijk is voor cognitieve controle; jongeren met ADHD die niet zo intensief zijn behandeld activeren dit gebied niet. We denken dat deze extra activatie positief kan zijn voor de jongeren, en er bijvoorbeeld aan kan bijdragen dat intensief behandelde jongeren minder kans hebben om verslaafd raken. Samenvattend: vaker dan wel vinden we geen effect van medicatie op het brein. De effecten die we wel vinden zijn subtiel, soms specifiek voor een bepaalde subgroep van kinderen/jongeren met ADHD, en lijken eerder een positief dan een negatief karakter te hebben.",

Injectors are at risk of infections endocarditis, which carries risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage usually occurs after rupture of a septic (mycotic) aneurysm. Heroine users can are also at risk for hemorrhagic stroke secondary to liver failure with deranged clotting and to heroin nephropathy with uremia or malignant hypertension. In some heroin users the drug it self is directly causal due to vasculitis, hypersensitivity and immunologic changes. Embolization of foreign material to brain due to mixed of heroine with quinine can cause cerebral embolism. AMPHETAMINE AND other psychostimulants: In abuser of amphetamine hemorrhagic stroke can occur, oral, intravenous, nasal, and inhalational routes of administration have been reported. Most were chronic user, but in several patients, stroke followed a first exposure. Some of amphetamine induced intracranial hemorrhages are secondary to acute hypertension, some to cerebral vacuities, and some to a combination of two.

      "title": "Marihuana \"High\": A Model of Senile Dementia?",
      "abstract": "MARIHUANA \"HIGH\": A MODEL OF SENILE DEMENTIA? ADAM SULKOWSKI* The evidence for marihuana-induced brain atrophy [ 1] and \"amotivational syndrome\" [1,2] has not been convincing so far [3-8]. There are, however, some striking similarities between certain features of acute marihuana intoxication and the clinical syndromes of presenile and senile dementia (Alzheimer's disease). These similarities become puzzling and thought provoking when one compares the experimental psychological , neurophysiological, neuropathological, and pharmacological studies of these two, apparently so different, phenomena. Psychological studies of acute intoxication with marihuana of mild to moderate potency have shown no effects on sensory acuity and simple reaction time tests [9-11]. Psychogeriatric literature provides no evidence for motor and/or sensory deficits in early stages of Alzheimer's disease [12, 13]. Careful studies of attention, psychomotor speed, memory and learning in our laboratory [11, 14] have not shown marihuanainduced impairment except for the subjects' ability to use effectively already memorized task-relevant information. We called this deficit a failure in information processing. The same finding has been repeatedly described by many authors in the aged and demented populations [15, 16]. Another intriguing similarity is in self-evaluation regarding one's performance. Under the influence of marihuana—and in contrast to alcohol effects—people tend to perceive their performance as much worse than it is in reality (i.e., they overestimate impairment) and as the result they exercise considerable caution and restraint (Sulkowski, unpublished data). As a matter of fact, in real life, marihuana users are said to occasionally endanger safety by driving too slowly. One needs only to observe daily traffic to see how exasperatingly \"cautious\" elderly people can be. This age-related psychological characteristic has been dealt with extensively by psychologists of old age [17-19].»Bedford VA Medical Center GRECC, 200 Springs Road, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730 and Boston University School of Medicine.© 1980 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/80/2302-0139$01.00 Perspectives in Biology andMedicine · Winter 1980 \\ 209 A unique and reliable effect ofmarihuana is alteration in time perception which has been seen especially clearly in \"time production\" paradigm (e.g., a subject is asked to signal the limits of a 10-second interval of time) [14, 20, 21]. It has been speculated that the drug alters our internal psychological clock. Identical defects in this hypothetical clock have been described in the elderly and have been considered responsible for decrements on many behavioral tests [22, 23]. Some experts contend that the left (dominant) hemisphere functions are more affected by marihuana than the right (nondominant) hemisphere functions [24, 25]. This reportedly results in disinhibition of the right hemisphere and leads to an altered state of consciousness. Recently published neurological theories postulate that this interhemispheric imbalance is responsible for clinical symptoms of dementia [26]. Rigorous tests of these theories are difficult to design [27] and supportive experimental data are very scant. On the psychosocial (interpersonal) level marihuana produces a quiet detached withdrawal from social environment which might be an analogue of so-called gradual social disengagement typical of very old and demented individuals [28]. It is possible that the failure to actively process information when \"high\" reinforces marihuana use through the mechanism of negative reinforcement by protecting the user from stressful cognitive overload with multiple and contradictory messages typical of modern society. Neurophysiological data from EEG studies of marihuana's acute effects show nonspecific and generalized slowing of alpha rhythm and slight to moderate increase in amplitude [29, 30]. These also happen to be the most common findings in very old subjects and patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease [31, 32]. Psychophysiological theorists ofaging have provided some experimental data to support their theory of autonomic nervous system overarousal in the aged and demented [33, 34]. This hyperarousal has been held responsible for interoceptive sensory overload which in turn interfered with CNS adaptive functions. Powerful sympathetic activation is a characteristic and dose-related effect of marihuana. Difficulties with theoretical interpretation notwithstanding, the decrease in cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease has been well documented. Again, there are some preliminary data (L. Miller, personal communication) suggestive of diminished blood supply to the brain in intoxicated marihuana smokers. Pharmacologic studies seem to indicate...",

      "title": "AGMATINE AMELIORATES SOCIAL ISOLATION INDUCED OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR IN MICE",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is defined as recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses (obsession) and/or repetitive purposeful behaviors (compulsions). 13% of children and adults are suffering from this condition. There are evidences that increased OCD symptom severity has been linked with diminished quality of life [3] and also increased functional impairment. Social isolation is defined as a state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others, has a minimal number of social contacts and they are deficient in fulfilling and quality relationships.Social isolation (SI) causes a variety of behavioral changes like hyper-locomotion, anxiety, impulsivity, aggression. These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia, depression. In addition, Social isolation and OCD are associated with similar neurochemical changes like hypofunction of serotonin, dopamine and glutamate hyperfunction.These changes might be one of the causes for exacerbation of OCB in social isolation. Agmatine [4(amino butyl) guanidine] is an endogenous amine, widely present in mammalian brain and proposed as a novel neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.It is a metabolite of L-arginine via arginine decarboxylase and hydrolyzed to putrescine and urea by agmatinase. Recently, Agmatine is evidenced for anti-compulsive like effect . It has also been reported for its effectiveness in schizophrenia , addictive behavior , stress,anxiety [11] and depression . Besides this, Agmatine is evidenced for modulating levels of serotonin [13] as well as dopamine and glutamate levels .Incidentally, these neurotransmitters levels are altered in social isolation and OCD. [14] Hence, in the present study, the effect of agmatine was investigated in social isolation induced OCD in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Animals Adult male albino Swiss mice (22–25 g) were group housed (n=6) under a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled conditions of temperature (23 ± 2C) and humidity (55 ± 10%). Mice were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7 days before carrying out the experiments. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) (SCOP/IAEC/2013/14/151). Drugs Agmatine sulfate was purchased from SigmaAldrich Ltd., USA. Drug solutions were prepared fresh and doses are expressed in terms of their free bases. Isolation condition Mice were housed singly in cages (21 x 38 x 14 cm) under a controlled 12-hour/12-hour light-dark cycle, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions), repetitive ritualistic behaviors (compulsions) and excessive anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is classified as an anxiety disorder under DSM-IV-TR guidelines. In OCD, the levels of serotonin and nitric oxide decreased; whereas levels of dopamine and glutamate increased in brain. Environmental conditions such as isolation from social surroundings lead to anxiety and increased level of aggression. The present study was designed to examine the effect of agmatine in social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior on marble burying behavior and locomotor activity. Agmatine (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in different groups of mice; activity was observed 30 min after dosing. Acute treatment of agmatine (40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced marble burying behavior. Moreover, hyperlocomotion was observed in socially isolated animals and agmatine was found to attenuate the same without affecting basal locomotions. In conclusion, agmatine effectively decreases social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior in mice.",

      "title": "Alcohol Withdrawal: Prevalence, Trends, and Management",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAlcohol withdrawal syndromes is a spectrum of symptoms that start manifesting a few hours after the last drink of alcohol and may last up to a week from the last drink. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substances in the United States of America, and so it is no surprise that there is a high incidence of alcohol withdrawal syndromes in the United States of America. Based on the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 52.2 percent of Americans aged 12 or older were alcohol drinkers. This percentage translated to estimate 136.9 million alcohol drinkers in 2013 [1]. Approximately 8 million individuals suffer with alcohol withdrawal syndromes; and approximately five hundred will have symptoms of withdrawal, warranting some form of pharmacologic treatment each year [2].Alcohol withdrawal syndrome results from sudden reduction in chronic alcohol use. Excessive alcohol drinking for even one week can lead to mild withdrawal symptoms, and excessive drinking for over one month leads to significant withdrawal symptoms [4].PATHOPHYSIOLOGYThe effects of alcohol are due to the direct action of alcohol on both the main inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission systems. The brain maintains its neurochemical balance through inhibitory and excitatory neurotramissions.Alcohol is a main central nervous system depressant. It enhances the inhibitory tone and inhibits the excitatory tone.Alcohol directly enhances the transmission of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABA acts through the GABA-A receptors with a resulting neuronal inhibition.The GABA receptor complex has specific binding sites for alcohol [3], so the transmission of GABA is directly enhanced by alcohol. Inhibition in the neuronal activity causes the sedative effects of alcohol. These inhibitory effects also lead to motor incoordination and cognitive impairment, which are commonly encountered in alcoholics. On the other hand, alcohol inhibits glutamate induced excitation [4, 5]. Glutamate is one of the major excitatory amino acids in the brain. Glutamate binds to NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors causing calcium influx which leads to neuronal excitation.Cessation or a reduction in chronic alcohol levels causes a decrease in the inhibitory tone and an unregulated excess excitation. These two processes lead to the array of clinical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.The duration of alcohol consumption has been shown to directly correlate to the severity of alcohol withdrawal [6]. Some people have a genetic predisposition to having more severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms than others.Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol WithdrawalAlcohol withdrawal symptoms occur in people who stop drinking for hours to days after they have been drinking for long periods of time.Minor or early withdrawal symptoms start 6-36 hours after the last drink. Minor withdrawal symptoms include: tremors, anxiety, diaphoresis, palpitations, loss of appetite, nausea, and or vomiting. Patients experiencing minor withdrawal symptoms are usually in their normal mental status. These early symptoms may progress to more severe symptoms if left untreated. Minor symptoms resolve within 1-2 days.Alcohol withdrawal seizures usually occur 6-48 hours from the last drink. There have been some reports of seizures just 2 hours post alcohol consumption [7]. Seizures due to alcohol withdrawal are usually single episodes or short, brief gusts of generalized tonic-clonic seizures with short post ictal periods. Seizures are more common in people who have been drinking steadily for many years [8]. Status epilepticus are rare.Alcoholic hallucinations would occur 12 to 48 hours post drinking and resolve with 1-2 days. These are different from Delirium tremens which occur later and may last for up to a week. Alcohol hallucinations are usually visual, but auditory and/or tactile hallucinations are not uncommon. …",

Brush abrasions indicated that he had been dragged to the vehicle. The head and right shoulder were wedged into the foot well with the body uppermost. At autopsy, there was marked congestion of the face, neck, and upper chest with conjunctival ecchymoses, bruising of the face and scalp, focal subarachnoid hemorrhage, minor cerebral contusion, and diffuse cerebral swelling with early hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ). Toxicology was negative. Death was attributed to HIE resulting from the unusual positioning of the body.

Accurate assessment of seizures and identification of epilepsy syndromes, thorough neurologic assessment to define etiology, and comprehensive evaluation of the patient's health and living situation are necessary for informed management decisions. Challenges to treatment include concomitant diseases, polypharmacy with accompanying drug interactions, and changes in physiology, such as changes in renal clearance and hepatic function that alter drug absorption, protein binding, metabolism, and elimination. Elderly patients with declining intellectual function, motor impairment, or altered sensory function may be especially susceptible to dose‐related CNS side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Drugs pre‐scribed for concomitant illnesses such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, infections, behavioral problems, and gastrointestinal disturbances may alter absorption, distribution, and metabolism of AEDs, with an adverse impact on efficacy and increased occurrence of adverse effects. The AEDs may induce metabolism of other drugs, resulting in decline in target response. Addition of an AED to an elderly patient's medical regimen requires careful review of all prescribed drugs. Optimal care of elderly patients with epilepsy includes use of free drug levels to monitor AED concentrations, careful dose selection, and sensitivity to the social problems that may occur in this population.",

      "abstract": "Typisch für Depressionen ist – und dies gilt auch im Alter –, dass sie häufig, multifaktoriell bedingt, unterdiagnostiziert und untertherapiert sind, erläuterte PD M. Axel Wollmer, Chefarzt der Klinik für Gerontopsychiatrie an der Asklepios Klinik Nord – Ochsenzoll Hamburg. Bis zu 20 % der über 65-Jährigen leiden an einer depressiven Störung und etwa 6 % davon erfüllen die diagnostischen Kriterien einer depressiven Episode. Häufig stehen jedoch bei dieser Klientel andere Erkrankungen im Vordergrund und die Beschwerden werden als körperliche Erkrankungen oder \"normale\" Alterserscheinung (Agism) fehlinterpretiert. Erschwerend kommt dazu, dass Depressionen im Alter oft atypisch bzw. subsyndromal verlaufen, d. h. die depressiven Syndrome erfüllen nicht alle Kriterien einer Depression nach den internationalen Klassifikationssystemen. So kann das Gefühl von Traurigkeit oder gedrückter Stimmung fehlen und stattdessen Schmerzen, Gedächtnisstörungen, Wahn, Reizbarkeit, Agitiertheit oder Schlafstörungen dominieren. Insbesondere bei männlichen älteren Patienten sind Schlafstörungen und Wutausbrüche Indikatoren für eine Depression, die nicht auf die leichte Schulter genommen werden sollten, mahnte Wollmer. Das zeigt auch die hohe Suizidrate Älterer, die ab dem 65. Lebensjahr drastisch ansteigt.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Drug interactions can occur whenever two or more drugs are administered simultaneously. Most clinically important antiseizure medication (ASM) interactions with other drugs result from induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing hepatic enzymes or significant protein binding properties. Other mechanisms, such as pharmacodynamic interactions between drugs, also may plat a role. Because many ASMs are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of hepatic enzymes and do exhibit significant protein binding, drug interactions are common in patients with epilepsy. Patients who have renal or hepatic disorders are especially vulnerable to drug interactions.",

Dentro de las adicciones comportamentales se incluyen ludopatía, Internet y nuevas tecnologías, adicción a la comida, las compras y/o el sexo entre otras1 . Se considera la impulsividad un predictor de la adicción2 , en la impulsividad existe urgencia motivada por un estado de tensión que conduce a la acción derivada del estrés o ansiedad y la acción conduce a la relajación3 denominada compulsión, y podría constituir un eslabón en la cadena del desarrollo del comportamiento adictivo4 . Por ello un programa de intervención de enfermería para trastorno obsesivo compulsivo (TOC) y adicciones comportamentales podría ser útil para el tratamiento de ambas patologías5 . Objetivos: ❖ Aumentar la motivación al cambio y eficacia percibida en relación a conductas de riesgo. ❖ Reducir sintomatología clínica y mantener resultados en el tiempo. ❖ Ampliar recursos personales y familiares para mejorar funcionamiento psico-socio- laboral de la persona. Material y métodos: Se realizará una evaluación pre-tratamiento, una monitorización del tratamiento, evaluación post-tratamiento inicial y a los 6 meses6 . El tratamiento consistirá en una intervención enfermera de salud mental dividida en módulos: A. Conceptos básicos sobre adicción B. Asertividad y respuesta social. Habilidades sociales. C. Gestión de la ansiedad: relajación y mindfulness D. Educación para la salud: higiene, alimentación y descanso. E. Psicoeducación familiar. Para la evaluación aplicaremos la Barrat Impulsiveness Scale (BIS)7 Resultados y conclusiones: Se prevé una mejora de la sintomatología adictiva y del TOC gracias al tratamiento psicoeducativo impartido por enfermería.",

The worsening of psychic state and full development of anorexia nervosa symptoms occurred during stressful life event (e.g. avoidance by sexual partner). The majority of those patients had present and past (from adolescence) various anxiety and depressive disorders and personality disorders (obsessive--compulsive, borderline). In most of the women older than 40 years, anorexia nervosa comorbid with depressive disorders, less often with mixed, anxiety--depressive, disorders. The symptoms occurred during menopause, after loss of life-partner (separation or death). It was not established, which of these disorders appeared as the first one.

      "abstract": "Alcohol misuse and dependence, and many of its accompanying psychological problems, are associated with heightened levels of impulsivity that both accelerate the development of clinically significant illness and complicate clinical outcome. This article reviews recent developments in our understanding of impulsivity as they relate to brain circuitry that might underlie these comorbid factors, focusing upon the clinical features of substance use (and dependence), bipolar disorder, and pathological gambling. Individuals who are affected by these disorders exhibit problems in several domains of impulsive behavior including deficient response or “motor” control, and the tolerance of prolonged delays prior to larger rewards at the expense of smaller rewards (“delay‐discounting”). These populations, like alcoholic dependents, also exhibit impairments in risky decision‐making that may reflect dysfunction of monoamine and catecholamine pathways. However, several areas of uncertainty exist including the specificity of impairments across disorders and the relationship between impulse control problems and altered evaluation of reward outcomes underlying observed impairments in action selection.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction or substance-use disorder is a chronically relapsing disorder that progresses through binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect and preoccupation/anticipation stages. These stages represent diverse neurobiological mechanisms that are differentially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use and from positive to negative reinforcement. The progression from recreational to compulsive substance use is associated with downregulation of the brain reward systems and upregulation of the brain stress systems. Individual differences in the neurobiological systems that underlie the processing of reward, incentive salience, habits, stress, pain, and executive function may explain (i) the vulnerability to substance-use disorder; (ii) the diversity of emotional, motivational, and cognitive profiles of individuals with substance-use disorders; and (iii) heterogeneous responses to cognitive and pharmacological treatments. Characterization of the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie individual differences in addiction-like behaviors is the key to understanding the mechanisms of addiction and development of personalized pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundInfusion reactions may mimic drug hypersensitivity, with a spectrum of variability and heterogeneity for both individual and drug; symptoms may include anxiety, diaphoresis, rigors/chills, fever, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, headache, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing/bronchospasm, hypoxia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and death [1][2][3][4].Symptoms usually occur shortly after the infusion begins but can have delayed onset [1][2][3][4].Symptoms may decrease when the infusion rate is discontinued or slowed; at other times, the symptoms persist [1][2][3][4].To add to the complexity surrounding infusion reactions, multiple nomenclatures are used, including drugmediated hypersensitivity, infusion-related toxicity, cytokine storm, cytokine-release syndrome, anaphylactoid reaction, and serum sickness-like illness [2,[4][5][6][7][8].The spectrum of symptoms, variable onset, and the multiple names implicate the immune system.Recognizing the molecular and ontologic mayhem surrounding infusion reactions, we used software technology to investigate drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Advances in information technology allow data integration at many levels; molecular pathways can be visualized through dependency graphs and statistical modeling [9].MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) was developed by Molecular Health to connect biomolecules, pathways, targets and diseases in a drug-centric manner.Drugs highly associated with infusion reactions are reported by MASE using Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs).PRRs are calculated by the ratio of the observed to the expected number of drug-event pairs.The Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) value is the PRR adjusted AbstractObjective: Infusion reactions can be serious life threatening adverse events and have been associated with many drugs and biologic agents.Our objective was to report drugs associated with infusion reactions using two different data-mining methodologies. Methods:The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was data-mined for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Drugs were included if there were >10 reported adverse events and if the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score ≥ 2. Molecular Health's MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) reports Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions and was cross-referenced to improve detection sensitivity.Results: Using FAERS, the highest EBGM scores by class were reported as: pegloticase and α-1antitrypsyn (enzymes), iron dextran and ferric gluconate (electrolytes and nutrients), infliximab and gemtuzumab (immunomodulators), and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (antimetabolites).Using MASE, the highest PRR scores were reported as: idursulfase and galsulfase (enzymes), iron dextran and phytonadione (electolytes and nutrients), gemtuzumab and infliximab (immunomodulators), mercaptopurine and azathioprine (antimetabolites).Amphotericin and vancomycin had the highest scores for the antimicrobial class for both FAERS and MASE. Conclusions:Using the two statistical methods EBGM and PRR, both specificity and sensitivity were preserved.However, neither system detected several drugs with established relationships to infusion reactions, including protamine and nitroglycerine.Reactions caused by these drugs were possibly underreported because the effects have been well established or due to evolution of administration with slower administration.We hope this analysis encourages further research into overlapping mechanisms for infusion reactions.",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "title": "Low-Dose Clozapine for an Adolescent with TBI-Related Fregoli Delusions",
      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration. He is the youngest of 3 sibs emanating from nonconsanguenious monogamous family with no genetic load of neuropsychiatric disorders. Unremarkable developmental trajectories. Distinguished scholastic achievement. No history of smoking or illicit drug use. No medical comorbidities. Had a history of MVA, 10 months ago, incurred severe TBI, admitt ed to ICU, discharged on prophylactic Valproate 1000 mg/d for posttraumatic seizures. He was faring well following this accident, as reported by parents, apart from occasional complaints of low-grade headaches and giddiness. Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment. He was seen by a private psychiatrist, a diagnosis of psychotic depression was entertained, and fluoxetine (Prozac",

First, epileptiform discharges not presenting as obvious seizures may nevertheless affect cognition and/or behaviour. Second, the actual seizures may be obvious but the way they affect cognition or behaviour may not be. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the epileptiform discharges in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes can affect behaviour and cognition. The focal discharges in other forms of epilepsy can also be associated with behavioural change. The Landau‐Kleffner syndrome, the CSWS syndrome, transitory cognitive impairment and transient epileptic amnesia provide further examples of cognitive and behavioural manifestations resulting from subtle manifestations of the epilepsy. Prompt, effective antiepileptic treatment with medication or surgery can improve behaviour and cognition in at least some cases.",

      "abstract": "The changes that often come in later life, like retirement, the death of loved ones, increased isolation, medical problems can lead to depression. Depression prevents person from enjoying life like you used to. But its effects go far beyond mood. It also impacts energy, sleep, appetite, and physical health. However, depression is not an inevitable part of aging, and there are many steps you can take to overcome the symptoms, no matter the challenges person face. Recognizing depression in the elderly starts with knowing the signs and symptoms. Depression in older adults and the elderly is often linked to physical illness, which can increase the risk for depression. Chronic pain and physical disability can understandably get person down. Symptoms of depression can also occur as part of medical problems such as dementia or as a side effect of prescription drugs. Symptoms of depression are a side effect of many commonly prescribed drugs. Person's particularly at risk if he/she's taking multiple medications. While the mood-related side effects of prescription medication can affect anyone, older adults are more sensitive because, as we age, our bodies become less efficient at metabolizing and processing drugs. Depression treatment is just as effective for elderly adults as it is for younger people. Since depression in older adults and the elderly is often the result of a difficult life situation or challenge, any treatment plan should address that issue. If loneliness is at the root of somone's depression, for example, medication alone is not going to cure the problem. Also, any medical issues complicating the depression must be also be addressed. The very nature of depression interferes with a person's ability to seek help, draining energy and self-esteem. For depressed seniors, raised in a time when mental illness was highly stigmatized and misunderstood, it can be even more difficult—especially if they don’t believe depression is a real illness, are too proud or ashamed to ask for assistance, or fear becoming a burden to their families. Nurse has a great part in helping.",

After administration of 12 pills during 2 days, he started hearing music and songs not heard by others. One day later, when the number of ingested pills increased to 18, he decided to discontinue amiodarone and consulted a cardiologist; no signs of physical, ECG or laboratory deterioration were observed. MHs disappeared next day and returned only as a single episode when he tried to restart amiodarone at a dose of 1 pill daily 2 weeks later. Finally, following complete removal of the medication, he experienced no MHs whatsoever. Amiodarone is known to seldom cause neurological or mental complications; however, MHs after the drug have never been reported so far.",

It can interfere with the activity of regular neurotransmitters. It influences on ion channels and release GABA, which inhibit the release of glutamate and cause disastrous effect on the nervous system. Alcoholism in teenage causes damage in maturation of brain and reduce the development of frontal lobe of brain. Girls show more adverse effect than boys. Negative alcoholic history of adolescent drinker also causes severe influence on them. Psychological study reveals the symptoms of alcoholism such as risky sexual contact, depression, anxiety, shivering, sweating, suicidal risks and heavy vehicle accidents. Drinkers may suffer from traumatic injuries. Other symptoms include headache, hyperventilation, vomiting, change in appetite habit, weight loss, eczema, disturbance in sleep and muscle weakness. It concludes that, adolescent drinker has reduced decision-making capability, have immature development of brain and have reduced memory storage ability. Alcohol should be banded until age of 21 years. More findings require educating people about dangerous activity of alcoholism. Therapeutic strategies should be used to treat diseases related to alcoholism. Future research studies should combine the idea of biological and environmental elements as bases for increased alcohol consumption effect.",

It is also important to note that it may be alcohol or substance use problems that first bring the young person to the attention of mental health services.

      "title": "Aggression and Violence",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

Wraz z wiekiem objawy te zmieniają swoje nasilenie i mogą tez przeobrazac sie w inne. Czesto wystepują one jako skladowe roznych zaburzen psychicznych. Najcześciej pojawiają sie w autyzmie, zespole Aspergera, alkoholowym zespole plodowym (FAS), zespole nadpobudliwości z deficytem uwagi (ADHD), zaburzeniach zachowania i zaburzeniach emocjonalnych, lekowych, takze w schizofrenii, nerwicach oraz fobii szkolnej. Niejednokrotnie są przyczyną trudności w uczeniu sie dzieci oraz powodują zaburzenia koncentracji. Wystepują w postaci nadwrazliwości i podwrazliwości w roznych ukladach sensorycznych. Towarzyszą im nieprawidlowe reakcje emocjonalne i ruchowe. Nadwrazliwośc powoduje zbyt mocne pobudzenie kory mozgowej i prowadzi do nietolerancji ruchu, niepewności grawitacyjnej, obronności dotykowej i innych objawow. Niedostateczna reaktywnośc, czyli podwrazliwośc, polega na slabszym rozpoznawaniu i odbiorze bodźcow, co z kolei prowadzi do poszukiwania pobudzenia i aplikowania sobie stymulacji. Dysfunkcje integracji sensorycznej zaciemniają obraz psychopatologiczny i utrudniają leczenie psychiatryczne. Znajomośc symptomatologii omawianej dysfunkcji jest obecnie niezbedna w leczeniu zaburzen psychicznych dzieci i doroslych. Objawy te muszą byc jednak poddane specyficznej diagnozie zaproponowanej przez Ayres i jej uczniow, a nastepnie poddane specjalistycznej terapii ukierunkowanej na stymulacje ukladow sensorycznych i ich integracje. Terapia ta moze wspolwystepowac z leczeniem psychiatrycznym lub psychologicznym i bedzie pomocna w likwidowaniu uporczywych objawow.",

      "title": "Basic Epidemiology of Stroke and Risk Assessment",
      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

According to this hypothesis, 1 drug abuse begins as a partially successful attempt to assuage painful feelings. This does not mean seeking pleasure from the use of drugs. Rather, individuals predisposed by biological or psychological vulnerabilities find that drug effects corresponding to their particular problems are powerfully reinforcing. For example, clinical observations suggest that persons who have difficulty regulating mood may be particularly vulnerable to abuse of cocaine or other stimulant drugs, persons who have difficulty controlling anger to abuse of heroin and other opioids, and persons who have high anxiety levels to abuse of alcohol and other sedatives. Many drug abusers report that their drug helped them to feel normal, even before they developed physiological dependence with continued drug use necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms. 1 Such clinical observations are supported by the recent",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Oro-Pharyngeal Dysphagia - or simply dysphagia - is the difficulty (persistent) in swallowing/passing food and/or liquid from the mouth to the pharynx into the esophagus and finally the stomach; a deglutition disorder (a symptom, by definition, often due to neuro-degenerative/−muscular, drug-induced or localized structural pathologies such as head and neck tumors, lesions and associated surgical and/or radiation injuries) linked to severe consequences on Quality of Life (QoL), including malnutrition, dehydration, and even sudden death. Likewise, Temporo-Mandibular Jaw and Joint disorder(s) – or simply TMD – is a multifactorial etiological condition, regularly encountered in the dental office. Whether due to malocclusion, bruxism, stress and/or trauma, TMD destabilizes the whole cranio-mandibular system structurally and functionally, via affecting mastication, teeth, supporting structures, comfort and aesthetics, and thus, QoL, again. While several treatment regimens do exist for such conditions, some of which have been standardized for use over the years, most continue to lack proper evidence-based literature support. Hence, (1) caution is to be exercised; and (2) the need for alternative therapeutic strategies is amplified, subsequently, the door for innovation is wide open. Indeed, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or “NMES”, is perhaps a fine example. Herein, we present the interested oro-dental health care provider with an up-dated revision of this therapeutic modality, its potential benefits, risks and concerns, to best handle the dysphagic patient: an intra-disciplinary approach or strategy bridging contemporary dentistry with speech and language therapy; a rather obscure and un-discovered yet critical allied health profession . A pre-clinical and clinical prospectus on employing inventive NMES-based regimens and devices to manage TMD is also highlighted.",

      "abstract": "As a highly differentiated physiological process, swallowing may be affected by a variety of confounding factors. Primarily described are swallowing disorders caused by mechanical anatomic changes (e. g., alteration of the cervical spine, goiter), surgery for head and neck tumors, thyroid abnormalities, and neuromuscular disorders. Age-related cerebral neurological and blood vessel-associated changes can also cause dysphagia (so-called presbyphagia) or worsen the condition.Medication-associated dysphagia is recognized far less frequently, not paid due attention, or accepted in silence; particularly in older patients. Furthermore, pharmacological interference of different medications is frequently inadequately considered, particularly in the case of polypharmacy.Initial treatment of medication-induced dysphagia includes a critical review of medication status, with the aim of reducing/discontinuing the causative medication by giving precise instructions regarding its administration; as well as antacid medication, diet, and professional oral stimulation or swallowing training.To date, medication-induced dysphagia has not occupied the focus of physicians and therapists. This is despite the fact that many active agents can have a negative effect on swallowing and medication-induced dysphagia caused by polypharmacy is not uncommon, particularly in old age. This article presents an overview of the different classes of drugs in terms of their direct or indirect negative effects on the swallowing function.",

      "title": "Disulfiram-induced seizure in a patient with alcohol dependence syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Disulfiram (DSF) has been used in the management of alcohol dependence as a deterrent agent for over 50 years, and it has been shown to be efficacious when taken under supervision. In addition to the physical symptoms associated with the concomitant use of alcohol, DSF may lead to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) when used alone, which are flushing, throbbing headache, perspiration, etc., DSF has an acceptable risk profile. However, it is associated with many adverse events and drug–drug interactions, including death. The most common less serious adverse effects include headache, sleepiness, tiredness, and halitosis (or metallic taste). Its toxicity may present different clinical aspects, though the mechanism (direct or idiosyncratic) remains unclear. Dermatological, neurological, psychiatric, and cardiac events have been reported. Serious side effects include hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, psychosis, seizures, peripheral neuropathy, and optic neuritis.[1] There are very few case reports regarding DSF-induced seizures.[23] This shows the need for research, especially in the Indian context, when alcohol consuming population and the wide use of DSF (sometimes surreptitiously) in de-addiction centers are considered. However, because of the ADRs and the dangerous effects of DSF with alcohol, it has to be prescribed with caution and always monitored by medical supervision. Mr. SD, a 40-year-old married male, diagnosed with alcohol dependence for the past 5 years, presented with uncomplicated withdrawal symptoms. Detoxification was done using benzodiazepines in tapering dose, and oral thiamine supplementation was initiated. Investigations including complete blood count, blood sugar, and liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. After he gave written informed consent, DSF was started at a dose of 250 mg at daytime as an aversive agent and increased to 500 mg per day after 1 week. He was also receiving quetiapine 50 mg for sleep disturbances. His birth and developmental history was unremarkable. There was no past or family history of major medical or psychiatric illness. He had been on regular medications under the supervision of a family member and abstinent from alcohol. After 6 weeks, he presented with an episode of generalized tonic–clonic seizure, characterized by sudden-onset, tonic–clonic movements of the extremities with up rolling of the eyeball, frothing from the mouth, and tongue bite. Although there was no incontinence, the whole episode lasted for about 1–2 min. The patient remained confused for few minutes after the event. Subsequently, he was rushed to the hospital and admitted in the neurology ward. There was no history of alcohol intake during this period, or history of other substance abuse. After admission, he was treated with tablet phenytoin 300 mg/day. All routine blood investigations (random blood sugar, serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and complete blood count) were normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy, and electroencephalogram showed generalized spikes. He was discharged after 2 days with tablet quetiapine 50 mg/day, tablet lorazepam 1 mg at night, and tablet phenytoin 300 mg/day. After discharge, he continued to follow-up in the psychiatric outpatient department (OPD). Tablet phenytoin was tapered up after 1 month. After 4 months of discharge, there was no relapse of seizure. We did not restart tablet DSF considering a possibility of DSF-induced seizure. The patient is continuing to follow-up in the psychiatry OPD, maintaining abstinence now and seizure free without antiepileptic. Isolated seizure episode in a patient with alcohol dependence can be because of various reasons such as alcohol withdrawal, head injury under the influence of alcohol, or electrolyte imbalance or related to drugs. The Possibility of withdrawal seizure was ruled out as he had one episode of seizure after 6 weeks of stopping alcohol. As per family members and his gamma-glutamyl transferase level, it was clear that he did not take alcohol before admission to the hospital. As CT scan of the brain did not reveal any head injury and his electrolyte levels were normal, these two reasons can be excluded as the reason for seizure. When the patient had seizure, he was on tablet DSF 500 mg/day, tablet lorazepam 1 mg/day, and tablet quetiapine 50 mg/day. As there was no history of seizure in the past and no relapse of seizure after stoppage of DSF and antiepileptic, it indicates a possibility of DSF-induced seizure. To substantiate our assumption, we applied Naranjo Scale for adverse effect and the score was 7, which indicates its probable causal relation between DSF and seizure.[4] This pattern of adverse effects appearing with increase in duration of drug exposure has been described in the nervous system. There is literature to suggest that the latency time from the start of treatment to the manifestation of the ADR differed according to the organ. Hepatitis occurred with a distinct peak after 2 months of treatment, skin reactions peaked after 2 weeks, and the rate of neurological ADR increased with the duration of therapy.[5] There are rare case reports of seizures associated with DSF. A recent review of literature revealed few reports in which the patients had generalized convulsions.[6] Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), a toxic metabolite of DSF, increases the release of glutamate from striato-cortical synaptic vesicles, suggesting a possible mechanism for DDC-mediated neuronal damage and development of seizures.[7] Norepinephrine depletion with DSF exacerbates seizures and facilitates seizure kindling.[8] DSF has a moderate record of adverse effects. Apart from DSF alcoholic reaction, evidence suggest that DSF when used alone can cause various side effects including seizures, which are rare but need to be considered. Awareness among clinicians about DSF-induced seizures in the management of alcohol dependence appears practical to prevent misdiagnosis of seizures attributable to other reasons.

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

When any or all of these factors are disrupted by a progressive dementia it is unsurprising that sexual ‘problems’ are identified. Most sexual behaviour ‘problems’ relate to expressions of normal sexuality complicated by changes in relationships, care needs and cognitive function, and complex ethical and legal considerations emerge. Rarely, new and severe hypersexual or paraphilic behaviours arise de novo , usually due to damage to certain brain areas, and sometimes due to medication side-effects, psychiatric disorder or delirium. Evidence and approaches to assess and to manage sexual behaviour problems in dementia are discussed.",

      "title": "Genetic influences in emotional dysfunction and alcoholism-related brain damage.",
      "abstract": "Alcoholism is a complex, multifactorial disorder involving problematic ethanol ingestion; it results from the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Personality, likewise, is formed from a combination of inherited and acquired influences. Because selected dimensions of emotional temperament are associated with distinct neurochemical substrates contributing to specific personality phenotypes, certain aspects of abnormal emotional traits in alcoholics may be inherited. Emotions involve complex subjective experiences engaging multiple brain regions, most notably the cortex, limbic system, and cerebellum. Results of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and post-mortem neuropathological studies of alcoholics indicate that the greatest cortical loss occurs in the frontal lobes, with concurrent thinning of the corpus callosum. Additional damage has been documented for the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as in the white matter of the cerebellum. All of the critical areas of alcoholism-related brain damage are important for normal emotional functioning. When changes occur in these brain regions, either as a consequence of chronic ethanol abuse or from a genetic anomaly affecting temperament and/or a vulnerability to alcoholism, corresponding changes in emotional functions are to be expected. In alcoholics, such changes have been observed in their perception and evaluation of emotional facial expressions, interpretation of emotional intonations in vocal utterances, and appreciation of the meaning of emotional materials.",

      "abstract": "Les schémas cognitifs précoces inadaptés et les schémas de détresse subjective plus spécifiques de la personne âgée sont de possibles marqueurs de vulnérabilité psychologique à la dépression [1]. Plus particulièrement, la réactivité cognitive a été identifiée comme facteur prédictif de rechute parmi des sujets atteints de trouble dépressif récurrent en rémission [2]. Elle est la propension à l’activation des schémas dépressiogènes dans des contextes de stress de moins en moins importants au fur et à mesure des épisodes dépressifs successifs. Elle témoigne d’un style ruminatif de réponse au stress, d’un déficit de contrôle de l’attention et de l’activation excessive d’un processus de contrôle des divergences qui pourraient être l’expression au niveau neuropsychologique des dysrégulations neurobiologiques sous-tendant la vulnérabilité psychique. En effet, cette conception de la vulnérabilité à la dépression soutient l’existence d’un défaut de régulation corticale sur l’activité hippocampique et amygdalienne [3]. Mieux comprendre ses facteurs de risque cognitifs est primordial pour le développement de stratégies de prévention efficaces de la rechute dépressive chez le sujet âgé. La thérapie des schémas et la thérapie cognitive basée sur la pleine conscience (MBCT) sont particulièrement pertinentes concernant ce trait. Les premières études du protocole de thérapie de groupe MBCT pour les personnes âgées montrent que cette intervention non pharmacologique est acceptable et associée à des changements positifs [4]. Ce programme de thérapie cognitive consiste moins en une restructuration cognitive visant un contrôle émotionnel qu’à un changement dans le mode de relation avec l’émotion perturbatrice et les ruminations.",

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

      "abstract": "Twenty-four-hour sleep patterns of 50 male alcohol addicts were assessed behaviorally during a 5-day base-line period, a 7- to 62-day period of spontaneous drinking and a subsequent alcohol withdrawal phase. Alcohol ingestion produced an increase in total hours of sleep which was associated with two distinctive changes in sleep patterns:1) fragmentation , a tendency to sleep in several short episodes (3-4 hours) instead of a sustained night9s sleep; and 2) somnolence , the distribution of consecutive hours of sleep was shifted beyond the base-line mode and long sleep episodes were combined with occasional naps. Fragmentation of sleep patterns was the most reliable correlate of alcohol ingestion and a frequent accompaniment of alcohol withdrawal. However, there were no common sleep distribution patterns during alcohol withdrawal either as a function of symptom severity or type of medication used. Contrary to the prevailing clinical impression, abrupt cessation of drinking did not invariably produce an initial insomnia. Moreover, hallucinosis occurred as a concomitant of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and independent of an antecedent or concurrent state of insomnia. These data are discussed in the context of current models of physical dependence.",

      "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

      "abstract": "Suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents is a matter of great concern and suicide-related behaviour during psychopharmacological treatment has been analyzed during the last years. Medication-related suicidality is defined as any suicide-related symptoms reported during the period of treatment. Suicide-related symptoms have several components that need to be considered to study suicide risk and its relationship with medication. The components have been classified and named in different ways, but the main are: Suicide ideation (thoughts about death, wish to be death), Suicide plans (to think about methods of carrying out a self-injurious behaviour that can result in death), Suicide communication or threats (to transmit or comment thoughts or intention of suicide, either explicit or implicit), Suicide behaviours of self-harm or suicide attempts (self-inflicted, dangerous behaviour with intention to die with nonfatal outcome). Self-injurious behaviour without suicidal ideation is not included in the concept of suicide-related symptoms by many authors, but it is also necessary to register it in order to have a complete picture and also because the intentionality behind these behaviours is not always clear. All of these concepts can be of different level considering real intention to die, determination of plans and severity of self inflicted injuries. Other important aspects to assess suicide risk are the moderating and mediating variables. The evaluation of suicide-related symptoms and association to medications has to be carried out with a validated instrument that assess all these components and their relation to different drug side-effects, prior treatment starts and subsequently during control visits.",

Sexual addiction, including addiction to pornography is not included as a separate entity because of a lack of strong empirical evidence in this area. Different scales can be used for assessment of sexual addiction. Since there is an absence of established diagnostic criteria, the significance of validity of these scales is doubted. Several of the questions in these scales do not yield information about whether the diagnostic criteria are met or not.

      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

      "title": "Understanding stress: characteristics and caveats.",
      "abstract": "Exposure to stressful situations is among the most common human experiences. These types of situations can range from unexpected calamities to routine daily annoyances. In response to stressors, a series of behavioral, neurochemical, and immunological changes occur that ought to serve in an adaptive capacity. However, if those systems become overly taxed, the organism may become vulnerable to pathology. Likewise, the biological changes, if sufficiently sustained, may themselves adversely affect the organism's well-being. Several factors may dictate an individual's response to environmental stressors, including characteristics of the stressor (i.e., type of stressor and its controllability, predictability, and chronicity); biological factors (i.e., age, gender, and genetics); and the subject's previous stressor history and early life experiences. Research on the physiological and psychological responses to different types of stressful stimuli is presented, focusing particularly on processes that may be relevant to the development of alcohol use disorders. Stressful events may profoundly influence the use of alcohol or other drugs (AODs). For example, the resumption of AOD use after a lengthy period of abstinence may reflect a person's attempt to self-medicate to attenuate the adverse psychological consequences of stressors (e.g., anxiety). Alternatively, stress may increase the reinforcing effects of AODs.",

These comorbid disorders significantly mutually influence each other’s severity and prognosis, result in a more severe course of both diseases and lead to more complications such as rapid cycling or mixed episodes prospectively. Individuals with a primary alcohol use disorder onset may have a better prognosis for the affective symptoms but for not drinking and drug use consequences. Treatment options have been extended by a number of studies during the last half decade. In comorbid patients, cognitive behavioral therapy can be employed, when the patient is stabilized affectively using a mood stabilizer such as lithium. A significant reduction of alcohol use was reported from a study adding valproate to lithium lithium, while other studies with antipsychotics or naltrexone and acamprosate did not yield any efficacy on affective symptoms or drinking patterns. In summary, comorbid individuals with bipolar and alcohol and substance use disorders are severely and chronically affected by both diseases.

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy is evidenced as an altered mental state with various neurological symptoms, such as memory and cognitive problems. The type of a substance-evoked encephalopathy will depend on the drug, substance, or combination being abused. The categories into which we could place the various abused substances could be tentatively divided into stimulants, amphetamines, hallucinogens, narcotics, inhalants, anesthetics, anabolic steroids, and antipsychotics/antidepressants. Other factors that may underlie encephalopathy, such as infectious agents, environmental, and other factors have also to be taken into account. Drugs of abuse can be highly toxic to the CNS following acute, but more so in chronic exposure, and can produce significant damage to other organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. The damage to these organs may be at least partially reversible when drug abuse is stopped but CNS damage from repeated or prolonged abuse is often irreversible. The major pathways for the organ and CNS toxicity could be related to ischemic events as well as increased cell damage due to metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in increased excitotoxicity, reduced energy production, and lowered antioxidant potential. These susceptibilities could be strengthened by the use of antioxidants to combat free radicals (e.g., vitamin E, lipoic acid); trying to improve energy generation by using mitochondriotropic/metabolic compounds (e.g., thiamine, coenzyme Q10, carnitine, riboflavin); by reducing excitotoxicity (e.g., glutamate antagonists) and other possible strategies, such as robust gene response, need to be investigated further. The drug-abuse-evoked encephalopathy still needs to be studied further to enable better preventative and protective strategies.",

Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of psychotropic substances (alcohol, drugs, medication) has a major impact on complex activity performance such as driving. This issue is of relevant social interest for the high number of potentially involved subjects and the often fatale outcomes, and affects also occupational physicians because of the high number of people whose job is driving. There are still few studies trying to assess the presence of a possible association between increased risk of accident/injury at work and consumption of psychotropic substances and results are not always in agreement. In spite of such uncertainties and some Italian regulations still worth being amended by Legislator, the possible impact of consumption of psychoactive substances on driving is an issue to be still better defined for which occupational physicians may play a basic role in the field of prevention, clinics and rehabilitation.",

Researchers have used various animal models, including isolated brain cells, slices of brain tissue, and intact animals, to study the mechanisms and manifestations of withdrawal. Results from these experimental studies have demonstrated that many consequences of withdrawal found in animals resemble those observed in humans. Such signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include enhanced activity of the autonomic nervous system; body posture and motor abnormalities; hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, including sensory hyperreactivity; convulsions; anxiety; and psychological discomfort. Researchers also have used animal models to study the electrophysiological correlates of withdrawal, as well as neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol",

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "title": "Non-essential symptoms of depression and cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) in community-dwelling elders without dysphoria or anhedonia",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Several neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in elders with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) can be part of a major depressive episode (MDE) or a “subthreshold” depressive episode. Certain neuropsychiatric symptoms of CIND are essential symptoms of MDE (e.g. dysphoria, anhedonia), while other are non-essential symptoms (NESD; e.g. fatigue, insomnia, cognitive complaint). Contrary to essential symptoms, NESD are not specific to MDE and are present in other disorders. It is unknown whether NESD are linked to CIND in absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. The present study examined the association between NESD and probable CIND in elders without essential MDE symptoms. Methods: Participants were 2028 community-dwelling individuals aged 65–96 years who had not experienced dysphoria/anhedonia during the year preceding the interview. Semi-structured in-home interviews evaluated the following NESD: alteration of appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor alteration, fatigue/loss of energy, worthlessness/guilt, and cognitive complaints. Probable CIND cases were defined based on the Mini-mental State Examination cut-offs (15th percentile) stratified for age, education and sex. Results: Symptoms of fatigue/loss of energy (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.42–4.09), sleep disturbance (OR: 3.04 CI: 1.69–5.46) and cognitive complaints (OR: 2.86 CI: 1.71–4.77) were significantly associated with CIND. These associations were not modified after adjustments for potential confounders (age, education level, sex, benzodiazepine use, chronic diseases, and brain disorders). Conclusion: A psychiatric symptomatology occurs in older adults with CIND in the absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. NESD encountered in the absence of dysphoria/anhedonia should receive particular attention by clinicians since they can be linked to cognitive difficulties.",

These impediments have meant drastic changes in my living conditions and social status. My disability was multifaceted and involved my whole person. Its expression was somatic, psychic, and behavioural. I suffered from loss of appetite, disturbance of sleep, psychic anxiety, depression, anguish, aggressive reactions, communication difficulties, disorganization of conduct, and so on. My personality no longer matched up to my own expectations. I was trapped in a situation of impossibility of living, despair, and hopelessness.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Cases of sudden and unexpected deaths of criminal suspects in presence of police always have special forensic medical approach. Often, such deaths are preceded by a state of extreme psychophysical activity (excitated delirium) of suspects, when they may injure themselves. Police attempts to prevent that can inevitably lead to struggle. Immediately after the struggle ends (but also during a struggle), they abruptly become unresponsive, and develop cardiopulmonary arrest and death. Presence of drugs significantly intensifies the harmful effect of such state and leads to death. Case outline. We present a case of death of a young man brought into custody during police interrogation. Autopsy showed injuries and presence of MDMA, with suspicion that death was preceded by the state of excitated delirium. After thorough analysis of the case (complete autopsy, toxicological screening, microscopic survey of all organs, circumstances of death etc.), our conclusion is that death was related to drug consumption - ecstasy. Concentration of ecstasy found in kidneys is the minimum concentration possible that could lead to heart malfunction and death. Conclusion. Our opinion is that there are no medical data by which we could determine if, and in what dosage, undesirable effects of ecstasy were enhanced by the circumstances of the case. .",

      "abstract": "Summary: In persons suffering from epilepsy, cognitive functioning may be compromised for various reasons, including—first and foremost—the learning and behavioral effects of the conditions causing the epilepsy. In addition, the epilepsy itself may cause changes in the nervous system through the metabolic and excitotoxic effects of the seizures and the neurotransmitter elements involved at the membrane level. The effect of the treatment modality, be it pharmacologic or surgical, may also play havoc with cognitive function. The neurobehavioral effects of antiepileptic drugs, although probably less important with the newer agents than in the past, must be considered, especially in polypharmacy, as recent reports have indicated. With increasing data, the effects of various surgical procedures on the cognitive elements of human behavior are becoming better recognized.",

Este fatopode estar relacionado, as acoes de saude publica, mudancas comportamentais, alem dos avancos nas pesquisas cientificas e recursos tecnologicos na area da saude. Com o avanco da idade, ocorre tambem a chegada de doencas cronicas nao transmissiveis, como a depressao. A depressao e uma sindrome de natureza multifatorial, que se caracteriza pela associacao de condicoes clinicas e psiquicas, tendo como principais sintomas o humor deprimido e o isolamento de forma gradual e continua. Na populacao idosa, a depressao associa-se ao proprio processo de envelhecimento (deficits fisicos e cognitivos relacionados a idade) e a comorbidades, uso continuado de alguns medicamentos, adversidades emocionais e mudancas de estilo de vida. Por outro lado, a depressao piora a comorbidade, diminuindo a qualidade de vida e aumentando a mortalidade. Esse trabalho tem como objetivo relatar a abordagem com um grupo de pessoas idosas sobre depressao na terceira idade. Desenvolvimento do trabalho: Relato de experiencia tendo como abordagem utilizada a roda de conversa. A acao educativa foi realizada comoito idosos, integrantes do grupo UnAPI (Universidade aberta a pessoa Idosa), da Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul.O grupo proporciona diversas atividades que priorizam a educacao em saude, alem da troca de conhecimento entre os idosos e discentes dos mais diversos cursos de graduacao da UFMS.A acao educativa foi realizada no dia 2 de agosto de 2017. Resultados: Foi iniciado com uma apresentacao e avaliacao do grau de conhecimento previo a respeito da depressao, posteriormente abordamos o mesmo tema , dando enfoque na epidemiologia da doenca, principais sinais e sintomas e tratamento.Notou-se a participacao constante dos integrantes no decorrer da atividade educativa, havendo uma boa integracao entre os mesmos, onde relataram suas vivencias pessoais e de conhecidos com depressao, demonstrando interesse nos esclarecimentos de duvidas quanto ao tema tratado. Consideracoes finais: Abordar temas emergentes de saude como a depressao, tem se mostrado de grande valia na conquista de autonomia em saude da populacao idosa.

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

It may be isolated, or accompanied by other mental disorders, such as severe anxiety and delirium. Frequently, agitation is a sign of brain dysfunction and, as such, may have adverse consequences, for at least two reasons. First, agitation can interfere with the patient's care and second, there is evidence demonstrating that the prognosis of agitated (and delirious) patients is worse than that of non-agitated (non-delirious) patients. These conditions are often under-diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Consequently, a systematic evaluation of this problem in ICU patients should be conducted. Excellent tools are presently available for this purpose. Treatment, including prevention, must be undertaken without delay, and the ICU physician should follow logical, strict and systematic rules when applying therapy.",

Current and lifetime histories of depression in the adolescents were highly comorbid with several other mental disorders. The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder. Depression in both groups was more likely to occur after the other disorder rather than to precede it. Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression. Comorbidity in the adolescents was associated with greater frequency of suicidal behavior and treatment seeking. The findings suggest that early-onset depression is associated with a greater degree of comorbidity and may represent a more serious form of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

Cannabis withdrawal symptoms usually manifest when heavy, prolonged consumption of this substance is interrupted or significantly reduced. The withdrawal syndrome may include sympathetic autonomic hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and reduced appetite. On the other hand, cases of psychosis induced by cannabis withdrawal are rare. In this case, we present a 32-year-old healthy woman without personal or family psychiatric history who showed a heavy and continued consumption of cannabis since she was 10 years old, without developing any psychiatric symptoms. However, recently she experienced two brief psychotic episodes with disorganized behavior and persecutory delusions, both episodes happening a week after discontinuing cannabis consumption.",

A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

Many patients consume licit or illicit psychoactive substances in prescribed or uncontrolled ways. This chapter reviews the evidence of various relationships between drug consumption and behavior, with particular reference to the long-term neurobehavioral impact of drug abuse. It is commonly assumed that the abuse of most psychoactive substances results in neuropsychological deficit. Whether this attitude reflects a sense of moral retribution or the belief that repeated trips across the blood-brain barrier must exact their toll is an open question. Certainly, most psychoactive drugs affect neuropsychological functioning acutely. The acute effects can be studied in a straightforward way by administering the drug under study in known dosage to subjects and then comparing either pre-post or drug-placebo performance.",

      "title": "[Psychiatric manifestations of autoimmune diseases--diagnostic and therapeutic problems].",
      "abstract": "In autoimmune diseases, also called connective tissue diseases, many systems and organs are involved, including the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system. The frequency of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations varies in certain autoimmune diseases. One of the most common causes of these symptoms are vascular pathologies, including inflammatory and thrombotic, immunologic and atherosclerotic changes. Neuropsychiatric complications may present as a single symptom or might form a syndrome. In a particular patient, a syndrome might change its form in time, presenting itself as a different syndrome. Quite a lot of these symptoms are not a result of a disease itself but its treatment, metabolic abnormalities, arterial hypertension or infection. Steroids play a particular role in the induction of these complications. The role of increasingly used biological agents is uncertain. The most frequent psychiatric manifestations of the connective tissue diseases are: benign behavioural changes, emotional instability and sleep impairment. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are most frequently seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (up to 80% of these patients), particularly with the co-existent antiphospholipidsyndrome. Psychoses with or without seizures are included in the diagnostic criteria of the disease. A separate clinical problem is an induction of a synthesis of autoantiobodies by some drugs, including psychiatric drugs. These antibodies induce clinical symptoms of an autoimmune disease only in some patients, most frequently the symptoms of lupus erythematous, co called: drug induced lupus, including arthralgia, myalgia, fever, skin lesions and serositis. The diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric complications of autoimmune diseases is quite complicated. It is extremely important to distinguish whether a particular symptom is primary to the disease itself or secondary to its treatment. The most important recommendations are treatment of the underlying disease, its exacerbations and chronic phase, and prevention and treatment of vascular problems.",

Existen, de igual modo, una serie de cuestionarios que abordan otros aspectos relevantes de esta patología, tales como gravedad de la dependencia, valoración del síndrome de abstinencia o valoración del deseo por la bebida y pérdida de control que pueden resultar de gran ayuda, al clínico, a la hora de establecer estrategias terapéuticas. La elevada prevalencia de comorbilidad psiquiátrica (sobre todo trastornos afectivos y de la personalidad) detectada en estos pacientes hace necesario un abordaje integral de los mismos, siendo recomendable una evaluación detallada para descartar éstas u otras patologías psiquiátricas. Recordar, por último, que el consumo excesivo de alcohol se acompaña de gran discapacidad, siendo conveniente la valoración de su impacto. En líneas generales, se recomienda la utilización de instrumentos que cuenten con propiedades psicométricas reconocidas y que hayan sido adaptados y validados en castellano.",

      "abstract": "During the last twenty-five years it has come to be recognized that a fairly large amount of mental deficiency appears to coincide with or result from faulty intracranial myelination. In some such children little or no post-natal development occurs, in others recession is already occurring at birth; a few remain fairly normal for some years. Spastic contractures, especially of the legs, grow progressively worse, epilepsy may appear, the child goes steadily downhill and early death is the usual termination. In some cases choreoathetosis is present, and this may either, if the patient lives long enough, disappear spontaneously, or, more usually, become impossible when the spastic contractures have immobilized the extremities. Post-mortem one finds one of two conditions—demyelination of the brain (the status dysmyelinatus of Hallervorden-Spatz) or hypermyelination (the status marmoratus of the Vogts). In both forms there is much hypergliosis, evidently secondary to some irritating but slow myelin poison which finally produces anoxia. Clinically during life both varieties appear much the same, and that is all that is known about its nature at present. Cases were recorded by the Vogts in 1920, Hallervorden and Spatz in 1922, Kalinowski in 1927, Helfand in 1931, Spatz and Peters in 1938; in this country by Meyer and Cook in 1936, Meyer and Earl in 1936. By these authors the views of others are summarized—Bielschowski, Loewenberg and Malamud, Urechia and Michalescu, Bouché and Van Bogaert, Casper, Ammosow, Bostroem, Bodechtel and Guttmann. If epilepsy has been present, it generally disappears after some years. By no means all cases end up as helpless idiots; some learn to attend to their own wants, but few ever walk freely.",

      "abstract": "Clinically, patients with Delirium Tremens (DT) and acute alcohol hallucinosis (impending DT) appear excited with vivid false perception. Cerebral blood flow and eeg correspondingly point to hyperexcitability in the CNS during these conditions. Clinical trials with barbital treatment in alcohol withdrawal shows that the amount of drug and the drug plasma concentration is the same no matter whether the physical signs of withdrawal are accompanied by hallucinations and clouding of consciousness. The psychotic signs in DT and acute alcoholic hallucinosis develops after many years of alcoholism as does seizures. We hypothesize that physical withdrawal is determined by the degree of physical dependence developed during the most recent drinking period whereas the psychotic signs and seizures are due to a cumulated CNS hyperactivity developed over many years of repeated alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. Changes of electrolyte concentrations in plasma or CSF do not play an important role in the pathogenesis of DT and related clinical states except that changes in calcium and inorganic phosphate metabolism indirectly point to changes in membrane excitability. A new model for a study of rapidly repeated intoxication and withdrawal episodes in rats has shown that repetition of episodes augments the convulsive component of withdrawal whereas the non-convulsive signs are dependent on the most recent episode only. The augmentation of the convulsive component correlates with regional differences in brain glucose consumption. Furthermore, synaptic proteins and acidic phospholipids may be involved in the development of CNS hyperexcitability during alcohol withdrawal. In conclusion both clinical and experimental studies indicate that severe alcohol withdrawal reactions may consist of two components: 1) Physical withdrawal signs determined by recent physical dependence. 2) A long term cumulated CNS hyperexcitability relating to seizures and psychotic signs during withdrawal. This state is elicited by alcohol withdrawal but it represents a cumulated and permanent or long lasting CNS dysfunction in alcoholics. The precise biochemical/pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of the two-component dysfunction still remain to be clarified in detail.",

Clinicians are often faced with the challenge of identifying an underlying endocrine etiology for behavioral changes based on relatively nonspecific symptoms.

      "title": "Cognitive Effects of Cannabis Use: A Comprehensive Review Across Domains",
      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most widely consumed illicit substance worldwide, with rising use particularly among adolescents and young adults. Accumulating evidence indicates that chronic cannabis use may negatively impact several domains of cognition, yet findings across studies remain varied and fragmented. This comprehensive review synthesizes current knowledge on the long-term cognitive consequences of cannabis use, focusing on attention, executive functioning, learning, memory, language, motor coordination, and social cognition. Consistent impairments have been observed in domains such as attention, executive function, memory, and learning; however, most evidence derives from studies of acute or residual effects. Evidence of long-lasting deficits after extended abstinence remains more limited and methodologically heterogeneous. Acute motor coordination deficits are well established, but persistent impairments in this domain lack conclusive evidence. Effects on language remain inconclusive, and findings regarding social cognition, though limited, suggest potential deficits in emotion recognition and mental state inference. Early onset and high-frequency use are critical risk factors for more severe and enduring cognitive effects. Some deficits may partially reverse with abstinence, although many persist long after cessation. Overall, cannabis use is associated with widespread and lasting cognitive impairments. These findings underscore the need for targeted prevention strategies, especially among youth, and point to future longitudinal and mechanistic research to better understand the nature, persistence, and potential reversibility of these cognitive effects.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definitions and deviations”).",

However, it has not been found a unique profile of impairment associated with cocaine addiction.To review the studies about neurocognitive performance in cocaine addicted patients, with special attention to the research method used.A great diversity in the research methodology of cognitive deficits associated with cocaine addiction has been used. These differences make difficult to compare results and obtain a clear profile of neuropsychological deficits. Even though, most of studies find neuropsychological deficits (mainly of medium size) associated with cocaine addiction. These problems are usually related to attention, verbal and visual memory and executive functions (working memory, mental flexibility, verbal fluency, inhibition and decision making). Moreover, in some studies a dissociated profile of cognitive performance has been found.Chronic use of cocaine is associated with worse cognitive performance. Therefore, the cognitive assessment of cocaine addicted patients can improve the understanding of the nature of the difficulties that these patients exhibit in everyday life and also can help to guide the treatment. Probably, the presence of subtle cognitive changes has important consequences on the behaviour of these patients. However, neuropsychological performance is not usually assessed in the assessment guidelines of this disorder. Therefore, it is proposed to include a neuropsychological assessment for initial assessment of cocaine addicted patients, as well as to tailor treatment to the found deficit.",

      "title": "Lithium for Bipolar Disorder: A Re Emerging Treatment for Mood Instability: Low Dosage, Slow Titration Might Mitigate Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Lithiwn is among the most effective therapies for bipolar disorder (BD), and enthusiasm for this simple molecule is waxing. The history of lithium is fascinating, (1) and recent considerations include that this element, the third on the periodic table, has few, if any, industry champions. The recent renaissance is caused by a groundswell of appreciation for the clinical efficacy of lithium and an increasing number of providers who are willing to manage patients with lithium. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Target: Bipolar disorder The target illness for lithium is BD, a spectrum of mood disorders with characteristic features of unstable mood and affect. Shifts in mood include recurrent episodes of mania, which are pathologically energized states with misguided volition and behavior with intoxicating euphoria (or irritability).(2) Psychomotor activity is elevated and out of character; speech and body movements are revved up, with a diminished need for sleep. The social, personal, and vocational consequences often are disastrous. The most common mood state of BD is depression. Depressive episodes consist of pathologically compromised energy and volition with a slowing of bodily functions, most prominently cognition and concentration; a pervasive depressed or sad mood is common but not always present. Presence of mixed states, when features of depression and mania are present simultaneously, is one of the many challenges of treating BD; an elevated volitional or energized state may occur with a depressed, dysphoric mood. Evidence for lithium Efficacy studies of lithium have focused on managing mood disorders, treating mania and depression, and prevention or maintenance care. (3) Most were performed during the 1970s and 1980s, (3) but recent studies have been comparing lithium with other mood stabilizers (4-7) and searching for a genetic basis for lithium response.(8-10) Other researchers have examined the use of lithium to prevent suicide. (11) Some have suggested a neuroprotective effect of lithium, which may have profound implications for neuropsychiatry if valid. (12-14) Results of additional studies, which are at different stages of completion, will clarify lithium use, (15), (16) and characterize the genetic makeup of individuals who respond to lithium. (17) The primary evidence for lithium, however, is for maintenance treatment of BD and for preventing manic and depressive episodes. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Biochemistry and physiology of lithium. rhe biochemical and physiological effects pf lithium are complex, wide-ranging, ind likely to affect hundreds, if not thou-;ands, of genes and gene products. The mechanisms of action remain a focus of aca-lemic pursuit (for a review of hypotheses 7elated to these mechanisms see Goodwin and Jamison(2) and Can et al (18)) Lithium is involved in cell signaling pathways that involve complex molecular mechanisms of inter- and intracellular communication; (19) some neural receptors are down-regulatee (20) and others show inhibition (21) which is thought to be a mechanism of lithium. The hypothesized neuroprotective effect of lithium (22) may be mediated through an increased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain tissue. (14) Recently, investigators using induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons have shown that patterns of calcium-related cell signaling in bipolar neurons are affected specifically by lithium in the culture media. (23) There likely are many mechanisms through which lithium's effects are mediated, including a series of dynamic pathways that vary over time and in reaction to the internal and external environments of the cell and person. The lithium renaissance In the past decade, there has been an increase in interest and use of lithium because clinicians recognize its efficacy and advantages and can monitor serum levels and gauge the patient's response and side effects24 against the lithium level. …",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

It now receives the attention deserved of a symptom that affects a quarter of the population at some time. Most important is the recognition that different pathophysiological processes can result in the final common symptoms of decreased bowel frequency or impaired rectal evacuation. Different clinical syndromes require different therapeutic approaches.\n\nBowel frequency is influenced by several factors including intake of dietary fibre, emotional make up, and psychological morbidity. Introspective individuals have a lower bowel frequency and produce less stool than extroverts. Infrequent bowel actions in the absence of symptoms can be regarded as part of the normal spectrum of bowel frequency. Low bowel frequency is more common in women.\n\nControlled cross sectional studies have shown that psychological morbidity is commonly associated with severe constipation.1 In some patients it is the key causative factor. Other factors include childhood problems such as sexual or physical abuse, loss of a parent through death or separation, or disturbed toileting behaviour. Underlying depression is another cause. For some the gut is their “outlet valve” for the normal stresses of living. The pathways between brain and gut that link emotions to bowel function have been largely characterised and shown to involve cerebral corticotrophin releasing factor and efferent autonomic pathways.

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

According to the recent reports, 1 out of every 58 newly-born children is suffering from autism. The aetiology of the disorder is complex and poorly understood, hindering the adaptation of targeted and effective therapies. There are no well- established diagnostic biomarkers for autism. Hence the analysis of symptoms by the pediatricians plays a critical role in the early intervention.In the present report, we have emphasized 24 behavioral, psychological and clinical symptoms of autism.Impaired social interaction, restrictive and narrow interests, anxiety, depression; aggressive, repetitive, rigid and self-injurious behavior, lack of consistency, short attention span, fear, shyness and phobias, hypersensitivity and rapid mood alterations, high level of food and toy selectivity; inability to establish friendships or follow the instructions; fascination by round spinning objects and eating non-food materials are common psychological characteristics of autism. Speech or hearing impairments, poor cognitive function, gastrointestinal problems, weak immunity, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms, weak motor neuromuscular interaction, lower level of serotonin and neurotransmitters, headache and body pain are common physiological symptoms.A variable qualitative and quantitative impact of this wide range of symptoms is perceived in each autistic individual, making him/her distinct, incomparable and exceptional. Selection and application of highly personalized medical and psychological therapies are therefore recommended for the management and treatment of autism.",

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

      "title": "Psychological and Psychiatric Triggers and Risk Factors for Stroke",
      "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric and/or psychological factors could be independent risk factors for stroke. Some of these factors may act as stroke triggers producing short-term physiological changes that may directly lead to stroke onset. Most data is related to four distinct domains: (1) depression and/or anxiety and related syndromes, (2) personality and character traits, (3) psychological stress, and (4) psychotropic medication. Some factors (e.g., depression) are closely related to stroke risk, and there is some evidence that psychological stress could be an important risk factor. However, many studies have methodological limitations (small sample size, lack of adjustment for stroke risk factors, or residual confounding) and lack of standardized definition and/or measurement. Data about stroke triggers is scarce but epidemiological studies suggest a triggering effect of acute or subacute life stress exposure. The potential pathophysiological ways by which psychiatric and/or psychological factors may promote stroke include a higher frequency of unhealthy behaviors and direct biological effects on the cardiovascular system, notably through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. More research is still needed to improve measurement and to better investigate the impact of psychiatric and/or psychological factors. The clarification of pathophysiological mechanisms could help to consider preventive strategies.",

Hypersomnia may be caused by an underlying medical or neurological disease. Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes. Hypersomnia may occur as a side effect of many drugs, due either to the soporific effects of the drug or to the effect of the drug on reducing night-time sleep.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them. These “minor” events can still progress to more significant harm.",

First of all, because the nosographic systems are not constant and, secondly, because the disorders themselves can vary when observed at different times. The aging subject is exposed to an increasing symptomatology or conversely, to an improvement due to the waekening of the narcissism. It is also possible that a continuum could be established from hysterical symptoms in the adulthood to delusions or hallucinations in the elderly.

At least four such categories can be distinguished: assistive devices (a) that are not designed specifically for speech, (b) that take the average characteristics of speech into account, (c) that process articulatory or phonetic characteristics of speech, and (d) that embody some degree of automatic speech recognition. Assistive devices for people with speech and/or language disabilities typically involve some form of speech synthesis or symbol generation for severe forms of language disability. Speech synthesis is also used in text-to-speech systems for sightless persons.

      "title": "Aspectos psicológicos y neuropsicológicos de la esclerosis múltiple",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",

      "title": "Developmental Dyslexia: An Update",
      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

While physical dependence is linked to withdrawal syndrome, psychic dependence, on the Author's opinion, is related to a long-standing previous state of true or masked endogenous depression (in this case it would be well termed as \"neuropsychological dependence\"), and the drug taking is only a maladaptive self-medication. This thesis is substantiated by the literature, reporting, in chronic drug addicts the use of the whole series of antidepressants (i.e. tricyclics, doxepine, lithium, etc.), with noticeable therapeutical success. According with other reports and with personal experience, the Authors maintain a great importance to drugs acting, directly or not, on GABA, i.e. l-glutamine, piracetam, and, particularly, N-dipropilacetic acid.",

      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT People with schizophrenia are more likely to smoke and less likely to quit than people in the general population. Several biological and environmental factors could interact to account for high smoking persistence in this population, including increased sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of nicotine or conditioned cues, beneficial effects of nicotine on symptoms or cognitive function, higher levels of craving or negative affect during abstinence, exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms during abstinence, and reduced motivation, self-efficacy or support for quitting. Controlled comparisons of responses to abstinence, cues and nicotine replacement in smokers with schizophrenia and equally-dependent smokers who do not have psychiatric illness may help to clarify the degree to which these biological and environmental factors may contribute to smoking persistence in people with schizophrenia. This chapter summarizes the research findings in this area and offers directions for future research.

Decerebrate posturing normally indicates severe structural or functional depression of midbrain function but can be caused by depressant drugs. Blood alcohol measurements are a vital test in the comatose patient as the clinical picture may be caused, or temporarily significantly worsened, by severe alcohol intoxication. The preservation of pupillary light reflexes in the presence of deep coma with decerebrate posturing should alert the clinician to a possible metabolic cause for the coma, including alcohol. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of alcoholic coma should not be made unless the blood alcohol concentration is grossly elevated and other causes of coma have been excluded by careful physical examination, blood glucose and electrolyte measurement, skull radiography and, in the absence of a rapid improvement, computerized tomography.",

It is characterized by intellectual deficits on the one side and maladaptive social functioning on the other. The intellectual deficits include problems in abstract and logic thinking, problem solving, reasoning, learning from experience and judging. The deficits in adaptive functioning appear in problems in social communication and participation as well as in mental overload phenomena caused by daily life activities. This overload often results in psychopathological features and psychosocial reactions which are usually observed in Burn-out-Syndromes as e.g. general exhaustion (depletion of primarily reduced mental resources), additional reduced efficacy (accompanied by feelings of insufficiency and poor self-esteem), and most typically feelings alienation (towards intrinsically familiar situations, towards relatives and friends and at least also against oneself ) typically accompanied by irritability and dysphoria. Treatment programs therefore should not only focus on intellectual deficits but should include also the multiple sufferings from psychopathological phenomena and psychosocial effects of such daily life overload syndromes.

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

      "abstract": "Alcoholism has always been emphasized in literature, narratives, and theater as its prevalence and related disability are very high, is found throughout the world, and affects women and men of all ages and social classes. There is a tragic or romantic fascination in the deep sense of personal failure that drinking is able to relieve and in the uncontrollable inability to stop drinking. These aspects have been portrayed well by fictional alcoholics in movies and novels. It has become evident that biological traits together with a complex series of psychosocial factors (e.g. negative life events, depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric or personality disorders), which are also well represented in novels and movies, can lead to alcohol addiction. Behavioral (euphoria, disinhibiting behaviors, aggressiveness) and neurological changes (confusion, bradypsychism, slurred speech, ataxia, blackouts) related to alcohol intoxication are also well portrayed by fictional characters. Delirium tremens, epilepsy, alcohol dementia, and Wernicke-Korsakoff disease, however, find less representation in literature and on the stage and screen. The treatment of alcoholic dependence is very difficult (as often reported by fictional and real stories), but should never be considered hopeless. It should be initiated at any stage of the disease. The support offered by Alcoholics Anonymous has always had great appeal for the public. Fictional works can portray alcohol addiction superbly and show some dark sides of human nature (negative emotions and autodestructive thoughts and behaviors), and, at the same time, the severity and pervasiveness of mental illnesses. The psychiatric and psychosocial aspects of alcohol addiction in movies and novels could be an inspiring source for new psychological studies and rehabilitation programs.",

Regardless of sensory modality, disorders of the special senses in the elderly can be conveniently divided into conductive, sensorineural, and central disorders. Disorders of the chemosensory senses, smell and taste, are usually less disabling than disorders of the other special senses (vision and hearing). Nevertheless, olfactory impairment is a significant contributor to perceived disability and lower quality of life among elderly patients and is a significant predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. Gustatory disorders in the elderly that are not secondary to olfactory disorders should prompt consideration of systemic factors, such as medication use, toxin exposures and autoimmune disorders.",

Some people develop symptoms suggestive of other medical or neurological disorders, such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, and memory disturbances.

      "abstract": "Both depression and conduct disorders are relatively prevalent and are related to poor long-term outcomes. Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

Consumidor de cannabis desde hace 5 años, con aumento en el ultimo año a 6 unidades al día, presentando de forma puntual fenómenos de autorreferencialidad e ideas de perjuicio en contexto de consumo así como cierto aislamiento. En primero de ingeniería consulta en psiquiatría por animo bajo, dificultad en la concentración y procrastinación. Se inicia tratamiento con metilfenidalto de liberación prolongada hasta 36 mg con parcial respuesta y buena tolerancia. Al aumentar a 54 mg al día el paciente comienza de forma instalada con soliloquios y risas inmotivadas, fenómenos autorreferenciales e ideas delirantes de perjuicio centrada en vecinos. Además presenta movimientos corporales repetitivos y desorganizados que el paciente justifica “como si estuviera imitando a personajes de videojuegos”, por lo que se ingresa en unidad de hospitalización breve. Se suspenden los estimulantes, sin mejorar los síntomas por lo que se inicia paliperidona hasta 18 mg al día con buena respuesta y remisión de la sintomatología psicótica.

      "title": "On the pleasurable, motivational and cognitive aspects of social play behavior: pharmacological studies in rats",
      "abstract": "In comparison to naturally rewarding behaviors such as feeding and sex, relatively little is known about the neurobiological underpinnings of the positive emotional properties of social behavior. In the period between weaning and sexual maturity (i.e. childhood and adolescence in humans, roughly equivalent to the juvenile and adolescent stages in rodents) substantial changes occur in brain and behavior that are important for behavioral development. In particular, the social repertoire becomes increasingly complex and social interest shifts from the mother towards peers, mostly in the form of social play behavior. Social play behavior serves to facilitate social, physical, emotional and cognitive development. Understanding how social play behavior is generated and which brain areas and neurotransmitter systems modulate this behavior increases our knowledge about normal social behavior. Furthermore, several neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) and autism are characterized by impairments in social (play) behaviors. In addition, drugs of abuse, such alcohol and cocaine are often used in a social setting and this can influence social (play) behavior to a great extent. Furthermore, social disorders such as DBDs and ADHD are an important risk factor for alcohol and drug addiction. Therefore, understanding how drugs of abuse affect social (play) behavior is an important issue. Using operant and place conditioning as well as behavioral analysis of social play behavior in young rats, we aimed to elucidate the neurotransmitter systems and neural substrates underlying the pleasurable, motivational and cognitive aspects of social play behavior. We found that the psychostimulant amphetamine, like methylphenidate, exerts its play suppressant effects via α2-adrenoceptors. In contrast, the psychostimulant cocaine reduces social play by simultaneous increases in dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmission. We subsequently found that prefrontal (anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortex) and limbic subcortical (amygdala and habenula) regions are implicated in the effects of methylphenidate on social play, through noradrenergic neurotransmission. Using place conditioning and operant set-ups, we further elucidate the role of monoamines, opioids and cannabinoids in several aspects of social play behavior. With regard to monoamines, noradrenaline seems to modulate the motivation for social play behavior as well as its expression. For dopamine, clear but opposite roles were found on motivational and pleasurable aspects of social play. We found that the endogenous opioid system is involved in pleasurable and motivational aspects of social play, whereas endocannabinoid neurotransmission does not play a primary role in the motivational and pleasurable aspects of social play behavior. By analyzing the dynamics of social reward-related memories in place conditioning experiments, we found that this type of memories undergoes reconsolidation that depends on β-noradrenergic as well as glucocorticoid receptors, whereas mineralocorticoid, NMDA glutamatergic and CB1 cannabinoid receptors do not seem to be involved. Collectively, the studies in this thesis advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in several aspects of social play behavior in rats. These studies provide important information on the neurobiology of normal, adaptive social behavior and may also give directions for the development of pharmacotherapies for social dysfunctions in psychiatric diseases.",

      "abstract": "Los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) son trastornos multideterminados en los que los niveles biologico, psicologico y social influyen decididamente en su aparicion y mantenimiento. A nivel biologico las alteraciones que se producen en el organismo debido a la malnutricion y las conductas purgativas deben ser tenidas en cuenta para no confundir las manifestaciones psicologicas debidas a alteraciones somaticas con trastornos de la personalidad, ni con interacciones familiares disfuncionales. Por otro lado el abordaje puramente somatico es necesario, ya sea normalizando las constantes vitales, recetando farmacos psicotropos, o regulando una dieta adecuada. A nivel psicologico las alteraciones de la personalidad previa, una deficiente autoimagen y baja autoestima que se asientan sobre una base depresiva, se ven incrementadas por las conductas alimentarias disfuncionales. Estas alteraciones psicologicas deben ser estudiadas en detalle para incluirlas como objetivo terapeutico (Espina, 2003). A nivel social, la moda de la delgadez y el exito en la sociedad occidental, hace que personas susceptibles sean mas vulnerables a padecer trastornos alimentarios. Por otro lado, las relaciones familiares pueden tener unas caracteristicas, especialmente la dificultad de autonomizacion de sus miembros y las alteraciones de la comunicacion, que son terreno abonado para la aparicion de trastornos alimentarios en personas susceptibles. Estos factores, junto con acontecimientos vitales estresantes (separaciones, perdidas, fracasos...), pueden jugar un papel etiologico y, cuando el TCA esta establecido, actuar como factores de mantenimiento (Espina, 1998a).",

Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases.

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "abstract": "The neurobiology of nicotine addiction is reviewed within the context of neurobiological and behavioral theories postulated for other drugs of abuse. The roles of various neurotransmitter systems, including acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and opioid peptides in acute nicotine reinforcement and withdrawal from chronic administration are examined followed by a discussion of potential neuroadaptations within these neurochemical systems that may lead to the development of nicotine dependence. The link between nicotine administration, depression and schizophrenia are also discussed. Finally, a theoretical model of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying acute nicotine withdrawal and protracted abstinence involves alterations within dopaminergic, serotonergic, and stress systems that are hypothesized to contribute to the negative affective state associated with nicotine abstinence.",

Over the course of 6 months, several nonstimulant and stimulant pharmacologic treatments have been tried, but these were only partially effective or resulted in intolerable side effects. Currently, the patient is taking the maximum dose of a form of long-acting methylphenidate. He is responding to this regimen better than the previous options tried. However, he is still having breakthrough symptoms (ie, forgetfulness, difficulty with organization, and inability to sustain attention). Neurologic examinations at each visit have been normal. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?

Many of these will yield a history consistent with, and similar to their present endocrine status, which can be traced back to early life before the onset of alcoholism. Some spouses, of drinking alcoholics, succumb to the unremitting emotional stress and develop the cortical insufficiency syndrome. The incidence of the syndrome in cosanguinous relatives suggests that it is hereditary.(4) Adrenal cortical insufficiency must be differentiated from muscular dystrophy, disease of a psychic basis, chronic brucellosis etc. A positive blood culture is necessary before the latter can be diagnosed.(11) (11A) Bacteriological cure can leave hypoadrenocorticism even if its existence prior to infection did not render the patient susceptible through immunity failure.(9) Present methods of treatment would yield greater success if endocrine homeostasis could simultaneously be achieved through carbohydrate withdrawal combined with the other measures described. Contented maintenance of abstinence would then be rendered easier.",

      "title": "Pharmacy medications and driving: delivering key information to ageing drivers",
      "abstract": "Ageing road users face an increased risk of fatality and serious injury in a crash due to their fragility and other issues associated with ageing. A high proportion of ageing driver fatalities involves multiple vehicle accidents, with many occurring at intersections. Complex traffic situations become more demanding, particularly in combination with deteriorating hearing, vision, reaction time and/or mobility. A range of research recently reviewed by the TAC also highlights that as drivers age, there is a higher prevalence of medication usage for health purposes, but the use of these medications can often and unknowingly, impair driving ability. Taking multiple medications increases the chance that driving will be impaired. Likewise, mixing of drugs with alcohol also has the potential to increase the level of impairment. Main classes of drugs that are impairing include anxiety, depression, any emotional condition, cold and cough, antihistamines, and epilepsy drugs. The TAC has undertaken a project to provide all drivers (but primarily those aged 60 years and over) with up-to-date information and associated safety advice about specific pharmacy medications and how they can impair driving ability/judgment, so that they can make an informed decision about their driving capabilities. This paper will describe the research and development of this initiative, including the comprehensive stakeholder engagement process.",

      "title": "Efficacy of Pharmacological Interventions in Targeting Decision-Making Impairments across Substance and Behavioral Addictions",
      "abstract": "Decision-making impairments reflect tendencies towards risky or unwise choices as manifested by presence of psychiatric symptoms or cognitive impairment (e.g. representation of value, inhibitory control-response selection, learning). Such impairments are suggested by the hallmark symptoms of substance and behavioral addictions, which include escalation over time (of substance intake or a given behavior), lack of control, neglect of other domains of life, and cognitive distortions (such as ‘chasing losses’ in gambling disorder). Amongst the putative behavioral addictions, most epidemiological data exist for gambling disorder, which is now included in DSM-5 as a substance-related and addictive disorder. However, other disorders share parallels and may also constitute behavioral addictions, such as compulsive stealing (kleptomania), compulsive shopping, and compulsive sexual behavior. The current paper presents a narrative review of evidence for cognitive decision-making impairments in addictions, as well as pharmacological treatments of these disorders that may have relevance for improving decision-making. We find that objective decision-making deficits have been widely reported in patients with substance use disorders and gambling disorder, compared to controls. Decision-making in the other behavioral addictions is under-studied. Evidence-based pharmacological treatments for some of these addictive disorders, for example, opioid antagonists and glutamatergic agents, modulate neural systems playing key roles in decision-making. But clinical trials have seldom examined effects of such treatments on objective decision-making measures. Future research directions are discussed, including the need to include standardized outcome measures of decision-making (tasks and imaging) alongside traditional clinical measures, to better understand and enhance underlying treatment mechanisms.",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

It is a rapidly growing public health problem worldwide. Nervous system complications occur in every patient with uremic syndrome of CKD. Areas covered: This review summarized central and peripheral nervous system complications of uremic syndrome of CKD and their pathogenic mechanisms. They include cognitive deterioration, encephalopathy, seizures, asterixis, myoclonus, restless leg syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis, stroke, extrapyramidal movement disorders, neuropathies, and myopathy. Their pathogenic mechanisms are complex and multiple. They include (1) accumulation of uremic toxins resulting in neurotoxicity, blood-brain barrier injury, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, brain neurotransmitters imbalance, ischemic/microvascular changes, and brain metabolism dysfunction (e.g. dopamine deficiency), (2) metabolic derangement (as acidosis, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperkalemia); (3) secondary hyperparathyroidism, (4) erythropoietin and iron deficiency anemia, (5) thiamin, vitamin D, and other nutritional deficiencies, (6) hyperhomocysteinemia, and (7) coagulation problems. Expert commentary: Nervous system complications of uremia contribute to the patients' morbidity and mortality. Optimizing renal replacement therapy, correction of associated metabolic and medical conditions, and improved understanding of possible pathogenic mechanisms of these complications is a major target for their prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

      "abstract": "Since its initial description by Kahlbaum (1828-1899) over a century ago, catatonia has been associated with psychiatric, neurologic, and medical disorders. Contemporary authors view catatonia as a syndrome of motor signs in association with disorders of mood, behavior, or thought. Some motor features are classic but infrequent (eg, echopraxia, waxy flexibility) while others are common in psychiatric patients (eg, agitation, withdrawal), becoming significant because of their duration and severity.",

      "abstract": "Cocaine, administered orally to patients with endogenous depressive illness, did not consistently affect vital signs or depressive symptomatology, but it did decrease rapid eye movement sleep and total sleep time. When administered intravenously in the context of a therapeutic interview, cocaine caused large, rapid increases in pulse and blood pressure concomitant with profound mobilization of affect and tearfulness. Infusions that caused lesser changes in vital signs were associated with milder degrees of affective change and less dysphoria. Thus, while cocaine was capable of eliciting positive affective change (such as calmness and elation) in depressed patients, affective flooding and dysphoric components were often admixed, indicating that cocaine's effect in this context could not be classified simply as antidepressant.",

      "title": "Psychodynamic Characteristics of Ego in Alcoholic Offenders and Non-Offenders",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAccording to Turcin1, none of the factors that encourage the criminal acts is as undeniable and obvious as alcohol. Nevertheless, there are numerous attempts of searching for something that could be classified as or prealcoholic personality.25 Some authors indicate neuroticism, weak ego, addiction and change in stimuli intensity as significant characteristics of the alcoholic personality. There is numerous evidence of weak ego in alcoholics.612Erikson1316 describes an alcoholic as an individual whose life course is defined by a negative ego-identity, which reduces and destroys his abilities. Thus, everything that makes the ego stronger contributes to the strengthening of an individual's ego-identity.Nenadic Sviglin10 states that the alcoholics who began drinking before the age of twenty, and exhibited the antisocial behaviour, showed the highest level of hostile feelings among groups. The psychosocial maturity in latent phase was lower in the group of alcoholics with antisocial behaviour, who began drinking before the age of twenty, than in the following two groups: alcoholics without antisocial behaviour and alcoholics with antisocial behaviour who began drinking after the age of twenty.11Kozaric Kovacic9 states that the group of aggressive alcoholics showed a significantly lower psychosocial maturity in the latent phase, in contrast to the non-aggressive alcoholics, which indicates the ego development blocking in this phase. A study by the same author showed that delinquent alcoholics exhibited a weaker ego in the latent phase with a significantly higher level of outward hostility than the non-delinquent alcoholics.The aim of the studyTo determine the psychodynamic characteristics of ego and Psychopathologie characteristics of alcoholic personality in respect to the type of criminal offence.The hypothesis of the studyAlcoholic offenders committing homicide have weaker egos and present more hostile, depressive and anxious personality characteristics.Sample and method of the studyThe study was conducted within the penal system, in the penitentiary in Lipovica and at the Dr Ivan Barbot Neuropsychiatrie Hospital in Popovaca. The study included two groups of subjects.The experimental group (E) (N=96) was comprised of individuals with prison sentences for homicide (N 1=32), traffic offences (N2=32) and property offences (N3=32). The experimental group was comprised of subjects who had been diagnosed with alcohol dependence during the expert evaluation and were being treated for alcoholism during their incarceration. The subjects had been drinking for at least five years and the clinical assessment of alcohol addiction met the diagnostic conditions according to MKB-IO and DSM-IV criteria.The control group (K) (N4=64) was comprised of alcoholics who were being treated for alcoholism at the Department for alcohol abuse at the Dr Ivan Barbot Neuropsychiatrie Hospital in Popovaca; they, too, met the diagnostic conditions. We excluded the alcoholics suffering from severe physical illnesses, those that had used drugs or other psychotropic substances during the last year prior to the study, those with obvious organic disorders, those suffering from schizophrenia or affective disorders not related to alcohol, those with antisocial personality disorders before the presentation of alcoholism, and those with high primary intellectual dysfunctions. Schizophrenia, mania, depression and antisocial personality disorders were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria.18 The study was carried out between the fifth and the tenth day after the admission.The following measuring instruments were applied for each subject:1. A structured questionnaire for general data;2. A structured questionnaire for the alcohol abuse history;3. An ego identity scale according to Erikson1315 for estimation of fixation and regression, to determine the six levels of psychosocial maturity. …",

Neuroimaging characteristics: T2 hyperintense lesions with little to no enhancement, edema, or hemorrhageh. Prognosis 1) Survival is variable (at least 3-5 years is expected) 2) Most low-grade astrocytomas undergo malignanttransformation with time 3) Risk factors for malignant transformation: tumorsize, gemistocytic pathology, presentation in first decade or after age 50 years, increased enhancement2. Anaplastic (WHO grade III) astrocytoma a. Associated with mutations of the tumor suppressor genep53 on chromosome 17p13.1 (as with the low-grade astrocytomas), mutation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 13q14 in 1/3 of cases, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 19q (the latter two are involved in transformation from a low-grade to an anaplastic astrocytoma)b. Presentation is often between 40 and 60 years of age (younger patients have longer survival)c. Mascroscopic features 1) Diffusely infiltrating heterogeneous neoplasm 2) Tumor may appear cystic and/or contain hemorrhagicfoci d. Microscopic features1) Cellular proliferation is more prominent than in lowgrade astrocytomas2) Often, frequent mitotic figures and endovascular proliferation3) No necrosis e. Seeding of the neuroaxis by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)dissemination and ependymal spread may occur but are rareoverexpression of proto-oncogene encoding plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)b. Occur typically in either first decade or between third and fourth decadesc. Usually hemispheric location, with predilection for temporal and posterior frontal lobes more than anterior parietal lobed. Tends to be infiltrative, with no well-defined borders e. Seizure is common presentation f. Pathology1) Pattern (from most common to least common): often fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic astrocytomas2) Fibrillary astrocytomas (Fig. 16-1) a) Well-differentiated astrocytes with scant cyto-plasm; atypical and hyperchromatic nuclei; fine, fibrillary processesb) Microcysts containing mucinous material c) Scant to absent mitotic figures and vascularproliferation d) Calcification is rare but may occur in up to 10% to20% of cases 3) Protoplasmic astrocytomasa) Hypocellular b) Cells with small round nuclei, sparse cytoplasm c) Prominent characteristic microcystic spaces4) Gemistocytic astrocytomas (Fig. 16-2) a) Large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasmand eccentrically placed nuclei b) Usually worse prognosis c) Malignant transformation: more often than otherpathologic subtypesTable 16-1. WHO Classification and St. Anne/Mayo Grading of Astrocytic TumorsWHO St. Anne/Mayo_______________________________ ________________________________________________________ Designation Classification Grade (based on criteria)* Criteria*f. Median survival: usual estimate, about 2 to 3 years after presentation3. Glioblastoma multiforme a. Most common primary brain tumor, 50% of all gliomas b. Presentation: typically after age 50 c. With the aggressive nature and rapid progression,presenting symptoms include increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and focal neurologic symptomsd. Genetics 1) Secondary glioblastomas (malignant transformationof lower grade glioma to glioblastoma) can be associated with mutation of gene encoding PDGF-α, loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN (LOH at chromosome 10q)2) Primary (de novo) glioblastomas a) Have no apparent antecedent low-or intermediate-grade tumor history b) Are often associated with amplification of theproto-oncogenes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MDM2, loss of tumor suppressorgene PTEN, LOH at chromosome 10, and mutation involving the RB genee. Most common locations: deep white matter and deep gray matter, including thalamus and basal gangliaf. Macroscopic and neuroimaging features 1) Heterogeneous-appearing mass with foci of necrosis,hemorrhage, and peritumoral edema (Fig. 16-3) 2) Neuroimaging often confirms the heterogeneousappearance, with central area of necrosis and a ringenhancing rim3) Despite the circumscribed gross appearance, thetumor is highly infiltrative and may also spread to opposite hemisphere through the corpus callosum (“butterfly gliomas”)4) Glioblastoma multiforme tumors may arise from malignant transformation of separate regions of the tumor and appear multifocal5) Contrast enhancement and vasogenic edema occur from disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB)6) Treatment with corticosteroids assists in reestablishment of BBB and can yield almost immediate improvement of symptomsg. Microscopic features 1) All the features of anaplastic astrocytomas in additionto prominent endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, surrounded by pseudopalisading of cells (Fig. 16-4)2) Neovascularization and endothelial hyperplasia may be due to production of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)h. Natural history and spread 1) Typical: spread of tumor along white matter tractsand around the ependyma 2) Atypical: CSF dissemination through neuroaxis(occurs in 10%-20% of cases), may include pachymeningeal spread3) Almost never occur: invasion of dura mater and metastasis outside of CNS4) Meningeal invasion is sometimes called “meningeal gliomatosis,” occurs more frequently with malignant gliomasi. Treatment 1) Usually includes surgical debulking aimed at relievingmass effect and increasing effectiveness of adjunctive therapy (also sometimes to obtain pathology specimen)2) Complete resection is not possible because tumor is diffusely infiltrative and multifocal3) Stereotactic biopsy: reserved for deep and inaccessibletumors and comorbidities precluding general anesthesia 4) Most effective adjunctive therapy: external beamradiotherapy administered to limited field, up to 60 Gy given in conjunction with temozolomide chemotherapy-median survival, about 14 months; 2-year survival, about 27%4. Gliomatosis cerebri (Fig. 16-5) a. Diffuse, infiltrative glial tumor (usually astrocytoma)causing diffuse expansion of a portion of or entire cerebral hemisphere; may spread to one or both cerebral hemispheresb. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-6) 1) Resembles low-grade glioma 2) Mild increase in cellularity and pleomorphism 3) Rare mitotic figures 4) No hemorrhage or necrosis 5) Neoplastic glial cells cluster around neuronsc. Treatment 1) Some benefit from chemotherapy (as with PCV ortemozolamide) 2) No role for surgery because of infiltrative nature oftumorg. Brainstem gliomas: likely to be solid, diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas (rarely pilocytic tumor arising from fourth ventricle with “dorsally exophytic” growth, which may portend better prognosis)h. Macroscopic features: unencapsulated, but well-circumscribed (there may be limited degrees of infiltration) heterogeneous mass; may have a mural nodule associated with a cysti. Microscopic features 1) Compact pilocytic arrangements of elongated (some-times stellate) cells admixed with microcystic areas 2) Classic feature: abundant Rosenthal fibers, may beslight nuclear pleomorphism and rare mitoses j. 5-Year postoperative survival: 85% to 100% (95%-100% for cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas) k. Cerbellar pilocytic astrocytomas have the best prognosisof all primary brain tumors l. Treatment1) Maximal surgical excision of tumor 2) Surgical excision of the mural nodule may be3) Marginal benefit from radiotherapy d. 2-Year survival after treatment, 5% to 10%E. Circumscribed Astrocytomas 1. Pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Usually occur in first or second decade of life b. Better prognosis than diffuse astrocytomas c. Common locations: cerebellum (hemispheres &gt; vermis),optic chiasm, hypothalamus, and periventricular area of third and fourth ventricles (Fig. 16-7 A)d. Less common locations: spinal cord (Fig. 16-7 B and C), brainstem, cerebral hemispheres (temporal lobe is most common hemisphere site); tend to occur in older age group (young adults)e. Cerebellar hemisphere tumors: often large cystic, fluidfilled masses appearing hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with strongly (but somewhat heterogeneously) contrast-enhancing mural nodulef. Optic and hypothalamic gliomas: tend to be solid, pilocytic tumorsadequate and cystic wall need not be removed 3) With increasing thickness or enhancement of nodulewall, the cystic wall also needs to be removed 4) Nonresectable tumors or recurrence with malignanttransformation may require adjuvant radiotherapy 2. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (WHO grade II orIII) a. Occur in second or third decade of life (average age atdiagnosis, 26 years) b. Often a history of seizures c. May originate from subpial astrocytes d. Macroscopic features1) Well-encapsulated tumor frequently containing a mural nodule within a cyst2) Often located superficially in temporal lobe e. Microsocopic features1) Large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, some containing lipid droplets2) Nuclear pleomorphism 3) Rare mitosesf. Neuroimaging: well-circumscribed cystic lesions appearing isointense or hypointense to brain parenchyma on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images,often with intense contrast enhancement of nodule g. Treatment1) Often includes complete resection 2) Radiation and chemotherapy often reserved forrecurrent or malignant tumors h. Postresection survival rates: 81% at 5 years, 70% at10 years; relatively benign prognosis 3. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Very slow-growing tumors, always associated with tuberous sclerosis (found in up to 14% of patients with tuberous sclerosis)b. Presentation: usually in first or second decade of life c. Usually originate near foramen of Monro, blocking CSFoutflow and causing hydrocephalus d. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, lobulated redmass (vascular tumor), often calcified and cysticLarge cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilic granular bodies are a characteristic feature of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which is a low-grade gliomae. Microscopic features 1) Large, oval cells with abundant eosinophilic cyto-plasm and large, eccentric nucleus; often surround blood vessels in this vascular tumor2) Pleomorphism is often present 3) Mitoses and necrosis are unusualf. Neuroimaging: isointense or hyperintense on T2weighted images; intense, heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted imaging with contrastg. Definitive treatment for symptomatic patients (i.e., hydrocephalus) or extensive tumors: surgical resectionh. Unless symptomatic, patients are only followed with periodic neuroimagingF. Special Considerations 1. Optic gliomas (Fig. 16-8)a. 3% to 5% of all childhood brain tumors b. 2% of gliomas in adults c. Female predominance (female:male = 2:1) d. More common in children: 50% of patients presentbefore age 5, 90% before age 20 e. Tumors involving optic nerve alone have a betterprognosis than those involving optic chiasm (which have better prognosis than hypothalamic gliomas, although aggressive tumors involving optic chiasm may spread to involve hypothalamus)f. Associated with NF1 1) Occur in 1% to 7% of children with NF1 2) As many as 50% of patients with optic gliomas haveNF1 3) Almost all patients with bilateral optic nerve tumorssparing optic chiasm have NF1 g. Slow-growing tumors; malignant histologic features oraggressive behavior are rare (reported in cases of optic chiasm and hypothalamic gliomas)h. Usually pilocytic astrocytomas causing either diffuse expansion without subarachnoid involvement or primary subarachnoid spread with minimal involvement of optic nervei. Symptoms unique to optic nerve gliomas 1) Visual loss, visual field defects, painless proptosis, andsymptoms related to increased intracranial pressure 2) Symptoms of hypothalamic involvementa) Endocrinopathies: precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus, other related endocrinopathiesb) Gelastic seizures: characterized by involuntarylaughter, more common with hypothalamic hamartomasc) “Diencephalic syndrome”: emaciation, cachexia and loss of subcutaneous fat, emesis, pallor, hyperactivity, inappropriate behavior, euphoriaj. Treatment 1) Considered for tumors with aggressive behavior, espe-cially for patients presenting with visual deterioration 2) Radiotherapy considered for patients older than 5years presenting with tumors in locations other than intraorbital (intracranial locations such as chiasmal or retrochiasmal) and when total resection is not possible3) Chemotherapy considered for patients younger than 5 years4) Surgical excision may be limited to biopsy, especially for tumors involving optic chiasm2. Brainstem gliomas a. Account for 10% to 15% of brain tumors in children(&lt;5% of gliomas in adults) b. Age at diagnosis: often between 5 and 10 years c. Heterogeneous group of neoplasms: all grades of pathol-ogy observed, but most are malignant, with poor prognosisd. Symptoms: usually related to ataxia and other cerebellarfeatures, long tract signs, or cranial nerve deficits e. Neuroimaging (can predict prognosis better than patho-logic features) 1) Lesions appear as a high T2 signal with variabledegrees of enhancement 2) May contain a cystic component (Fig. 16-9) 3) Diffuse pontine gliomas: all are malignant 4) Most gliomas involving cervicomedullary junction arelow-grade gliomas 5) Tumors of midbrain usually have a better prognosisthan those involving medulla or pons 6) Dorsal exophytic tumors tend to have betterprognosis f. Prognosis1) Best for focal lesions, dorsal exophytic tumors, low histologic grade, longer period from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, adult age group, and in context of neurofibromatosis2) 5-Year survival: 5% to 30% g. Treatment1) Best: radiotherapy 2) Surgical resection usually involves stereotactic biopsy;is best performed on focal, cystic, or exophytic tumorsG. Rare Astrocytic Variants 1. Gliosarcomas: high-grade gliomas admixed with sarco-ma (variant of glioblastoma multiforme, with same prognosis)2. Gliofibroma a. Glioma admixed with population of cells resemblingfibroblasts b. Usually present in the first decadeH. Oligodendroglioma 1. From cells of oligodendroglial origin (O2A progenitorcells)2. Genetics a. Development of low-grade oligodendrogliomas: associ-ated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p, 19q, and 4qb. Development of high-grade oligodendrogliomas from the low-grade tumors: associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 9p and 10qc. Both are associated with overexpression of EGFR 3. Account for 5% of all primary brain tumors and 30%of all intracranial gliomas 4. May be a male predominance (male:female = 3:2) 5. More often presents in adults: usually present betweenthird and fifth decades 6. Small earlier peak in childhood between 6 and 12 years;thalamic location at presentation is common in children7. Seizures are often the initial presentation in up to 75% of patients because tumor commonly involves cerebral cortex8. Most common location: frontal lobe, followed by temporal and parietal lobes; rarely brainstem or spinal cord9. Slow-growing, infiltrative gliomas: may start in subcortical white matter, tend to spread along white matter tracts and corpus callosum10. Better prognosis than astrocytomas 11. 5-Year survival rate, 75% 12. Mean postoperative survival, 4 to 11 years13. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, unencapsulated mass with cystic degeneration and calcification (necrosis and hemorrhage are rare)14. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-10) a. Variable b. Homogeneously appearing cells with sparse cytoplasmand round, uniform nuclei c. Cells may appear elongated, with a displaced nucleus;because of fixation artifact, there may be artifactual clearing of the cytoplasm, resembling fried eggsd. There may be mucin-rich microcystic spaces e. Capillaries interposed between uniform-appearing cellsmay form a delicate vascular “chicken-wire” pattern f. Pleomorphism and endothelial hyperplasia (less commonly,necrosis) indicate high-grade oligodendroglioma 15. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous appearing T2hyperintense mass often involving cerebral cortex with variable, heterogeneous enhancement pattern, cystic component, and calcification (in up to 90% of cases)16. Classified into high-grade and low-grade tumors 17. Features associated with high-grade tumors and lessfavorable prognosis a. Contrast enhancement b. Endothelial proliferation c. Mitotic figures d. More than 5% of MIB-1 staining e. Astrocytic component (with oligoastrocytomas, asdiscussed below) 18. Treatmenta. Gross total resection when possible (because tumor is infiltrative, microscopic infiltrates always remain)b. Primary adjuvant therapy: chemotherapy with alkylating agent such as temozolomide (before development of temozolomide, procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine [PVC] were used)c. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 1p or combined loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and 19q (50%- 80% of cases) portend better prognosis, prolonged survival, and better response to chemotherapyd. Although intermediate-grade oligodendrogliomas are often chemotherapy-responsive (e.g., 1p/19q deleted tumors), radiation (often in combination with chemotherapy) is still the mainstay of treatment to achieve maximal survival advantageI. Oligoastrocytoma 1. Composed of different populations of cells, someresembling astrocytes, some oligodendrocytes, and some indeterminate2. A common progenitor cell that differentiates into two different cell lines is likely3. Glial tumors with predominant oligodendrocytic population of cells are often interpreted as oligodendrocytes4. Increasing proportion of oligodendroglial component generally portends better prognosis (chromosome 1p and 19q deletions signify greater sensitivity of tumor to chemotherapy)J. Ependymoma 1. Epidemiologya. 5% to 8% of all primary intracranial tumors b. Age at presentation often in the first decade, with asecond peak in the fourth decade (prognosis worse for patients younger than 3 years)c. Third most common brain tumor in children d. Location (pediatric population): intracranial (90%) orspinal cord (10%) e. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occuring in childrenare infratentorial and about 1/3 supratentorial f. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occur in children (mostlyinfratentorial), and more than 90% of spinal cord ependymomas occur in adults (mostly myxopapillary ependymomas)2. Symptoms at presentation (depend largely on tumor location) a. Intracranial tumors often occur on floor (more frequentthan roof or lateral recesses) of fourth ventricle (medul-loblastomas tend to arise most frequently from roof of fourth ventricle)b. May present with obstructive hydrocephalus and associated symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, nystagmus3. Potential for CSF dissemination: because of close contact with CSF, there may be “drop metastasis” in 5% of cases4. Myxopapillary ependymomas a. Well-encapsulated, indolent, slow-growing vasculartumors arising from filum terminale b. Occur most often in adults c. Associated with good prognosis5. Posterior fossa ependymomas a. Well-demarcated tumors that tend to fill fourth ventricleand extend through foramen magnum b. Appear as T2 hyperintense masses with heterogeneoussignal that may represent tumor vascularity (or necrosis) c. Often a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement6. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-11) a. Sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei and variablecytoplasm among perivascular anuclear fibrillary processes: “pseudorosettes” (fine cellular fibrillary processes that radiate toward blood vessel)b. Myxopapillary ependymomas are characterized by sheets of uniform columnar or cuboidal cells admixed with pools of mucin often bordered by tumor cells and containing a central blood vesselc. Cytologic pleomorphism, necrosis, mitotic figures, and giant cells often signify anaplastic ependymomas7. Treatment: surgical resection and/or adjuvant radiotherapy (optimal outcome with doses between 5,000 cGy and 5,500 cGy) a. Higher survival with gross total resection: goal is toobtain maximal possible resection b. For low-grade ependymomas of spine parenchyma orfilum terminale (myxopapillary ependymoma): surgical resection is mainstay of treatment, radiation is considered if residual tumor is present postoperativelyc. Extensive craniospinal radiation to entire neuroaxis required for patients presenting with CSF disseminationd. Response to chemotherapy is suboptimal; this treatment modality is considered for patients with contraindications to radiation (e.g., children younger than 3 years or patients with recurrent disease )8. Prognosis: generally favorable, especially adults with myxopapillary ependymomas (except for 10%-20% of cases that have CSF dissemination)9. Reduced survival has been associated with young age at onset and anaplastic histopathologic features, and higher risk of recurrence with partial resectionsK. Subependymoma 1. Slow-growing large firm masses most often occurring infourth ventricle, arising from medulla or lateral ventricles attached to septum pellucidum2. Age at presentation: usually between 40 and 60 years 3. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-12): cells with roundnuclei and sparse cytoplasm; admixed with microcystic clusters and foci of calcification on a fibrillary background4. Neuroimaging characteristics: mildly hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images often with heterogeneous appearance and little to no enhancementA. Ganglion Cell Neoplasms 1. Rare, slow-growing, benign well-circumscribed firmtumors often occurring in temporal lobes, sometimes with cystic or calcified foci2. Age at presentation: first 3 decades 3. Most common presentation: seizures (oftenintractable) 4. Predilection for temporal lobes (followed by frontal andparietal lobes); much less common, cerebellum and spinal cord5. Neuroimaging characteristics: classically appear as well-circumscribed cystic mass (hyperintense on T2weighted images) with a mural nodule with variable enhancement6. Microscopic features a. Presence of both neuronal (ganglion) and glial neoplasticcells b. Gangliocytoma: tumors with predominance ofneoplastic ganglion cells without an obvious astrocytic componentc. Ganglioglioma: tumors containing neoplastic glial cells that often outnumber ganglion cellsd. Some neoplastic ganglion cells are binucleated or multinucleated (unfortunately not always present, but quite helpful when present) (Fig. 16-13)7. Treatment a. Resection b. Radiotherapy: reserved for recurrent tumor or thosewith anaplastic histopathologic features 8. Prognosisa. Most carry benign prognosis with total or subtotal resectionb. Anaplastic histopathologic features: less favorable prognosisB. Central Neurocytomas 1. Neoplasms of neuronal differentiation 2. Rare (about 0.5% of all primary CNS tumors), occurprimarily in young adults between second and fourth decades3. Commonly present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (most commonly, headaches)4. Most commonly an intraventricular location, often at foramen of Monro: 50% of all intraventricular tumors in adults5. Microscopic features: sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei; immunoreactive for synaptophysin6. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous signal (isointense or hyperintense on T2-weighted images) with heterogeneous enhancement (Fig. 6-14)7. Treatment often involves resection (total, if possible) 8. Benign prognosis with total or subtotal resection, withlong survival ratesC. Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor (DNET) 1. Rare, slow-growing (sometimes cystic) tumors withpredilection for temporal lobes 2. Most common presentation: complex partial seizures(often intractable) 3. Microscopic featuresa. Mucin-rich cellular glial nodules containing masses of oligodendrocyte-like cellsb. Specific glioneuronal elements c. Adjacent foci of cortical dysplasia d. Dystrophic calcification4. Neuroimaging characteristics: hyperintense on T2weighted images (hypointense on T1-weighted images)5. Benign prognosis 6. Surgical resection usually reserved for symptomaticcases (e.g., intractable seizures)D. Lhermitte-Duclos Disease (dysplastic gangliocytoma of cerebellum)1. Commonly presents as slow-growing cerebellar mass with increased intracranial pressure2. Commonly presents in the fourth decade 3. Associated with Cowden’s disease (about 50% ofpatients with dysplastic gangliocytoma have clinical stigmata of Cowden’s disease)4. Macroscopic features: hypertrophied, thickened cerebellar folia (Fig. 16-15)5. Microscopic features a. Enlarged ganglion cells (neurons) replace granule cells,atrophy of granular layer b. Loss of Purkinje cells c. Reduction and cavitation of cerebellar white matter6. Neuroimaging: laminated increased T2 signal without enhancementE. Desmoplastic Infantile Astrocytoma (DIA) and Ganglioma (DIG)1. Rare, often occurring in the first 2 years of life 2.

Even alcoholics who have been abstinent for short periods of time (i.e., several weeks) or extended periods of time (i.e., several years) may experience persistent sleep abnormalities. Researchers also found that alcoholics are more likely to suffer from certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea.

Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of learning disabilities",
      "abstract": "Learning disabilities are a heterogeneous diagnostic category. As a specific disorder learning disabilities include reading disorders, disorders of written expression and mathematics disorders. As a general concept, learning disabilities may be categorised into four symptom complexes, which are not mutually exclusive: 1. dyslexia, 2. motor-perceptual; 3. language delay; 4. hyperactivity. In clinical settings these neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed in school-aged children. The most common referral reasons are significant difficulties in school achievement or difficulties in child adjustment and functioning that are manifested through behavioural and emotional difficulties caused by learning disabilities. Since academic achievement is an important aspect of self-esteem in childhood, school failure may result in many short-term and long-term consequences for the child’s functioning in narrow and broader social contexts, development of maladaptive behaviour and also cause the development of psychopathology. The most common short-term consequences include low academic and general self-esteem, lack of motivation for schooling and related obligations, behavioural disorders, a sense of overload in the child, peer relationship problems and a heightened level of family conflicts. The usual long-term outcomes are psychosomatic problems, affective disorders (depression, anxiety) and severe behavioural problems. Furthermore, longitudinal studies show the persistence of certain problems in adulthood.In summary, impairments should be adequately assessed to evaluate the cognitive deficits and strengths, and a precise diagnosis should be established. Once problem areas have been identified, special teaching strategies can be devised in collaboration with the school to circumvent handicaps. Also, an important part of intervention includes counselling of parents and children.",

      "abstract": "Summary Lithium is the reference compound in drug therapy of bipolar disorders, even if recently several mood stabilizers, with a good tolerability profile, have become available. One problem with the use of lithium salts is its neurotoxicity (neurological, psychiatric and cognitive side-effects). The adverse reactions are not always correlated with serum levels of lithium and may appear within the plasmatic range. The neurotoxicity may be a reversible or irreversible condition depending upon timeliness of identification and treatment. In this report, a clinical case is described in a female patient affected by bipolar disorder, type 1. In the psychiatric history of the patient, one depressive episode and two maniac episodes were recorded (Fig. 1); the patient was treated with lithium carbonate after the last maniac episode. During the previous year, she gradu- ally showed signs of encephalopathy: tremor, ataxia, drop attack, unsteady march, positive Romberg, adiadochokinesis, dysarthria, light muscular stiffness hyper-reflexia in legs and arms, light fasciculation of the tongue, hyper-salivation; mental confusion, numbness, disorientation, reduced attention and memory. The serum level of lithium carbonate was always found within the therapeutic range. An electroencephalogram (EEG) performed on the day of hospitalization showed transient diffuse abnormali- ties, suggesting dismetabolic encephalopathy (Fig. 2). An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed repolarization abnormalities (Fig. 3). After gradual washout of lithium and titration of lamotrigine as a substitutive mood stabilizer, the EEG abnormalities disap- peared with return to a normal pattern of cerebral electric activity (Fig. 4) and previ- ous neurological and psychiatric signs disappeared within three weeks. At the end of follow-up, ECG was normal (Fig. 5). The present report underlines the importance of EEG monitoring in patients on the lithium therapy as a possible early index of lithium neurotoxicity.",

Craving may be associated with risk-taking reckless behavior to seek pleasure including cigarette smoking, binge alcohol drinking, and illicit drug abuse (e.g. cocaine, methamphetamine, methylene deoxy meth-amphetamine (MDMA), ecstasy, morphine and heroine). Craving for food, sex and drugs involves the limbic system and prefrontal cortex. Thus, basic understanding of craving is exceedingly important for the better clinical management of major depression, hopelessness, and poor quality of life among young adolescents, as well as morbidity and early mortality among adults. Physical, psychological, nutritional, and medical rehabilitation may be helpful in the effective clinical management of patients with craving of any age, sex and race. Further studies on the psychology of craving will curb the number of hospital admissions as several victims of drug craving develop schizophrenia later in their life, if they remain untreated.",

Clinical Presentation: A 66-year-old man presented to the emergency department with dysarthria and uncontrolled tremor, rapidly deteriorating into a complex of severe neurological and metabolic derangements. Only after repeated attempts to take a thorough history was lithium toxicity identified. Conclusion: Thorough, comprehensive history taking, including chronic medications and their substitutes, is essential and lifesaving when potentially lethal medications are involved.",

      "abstract": "Memory problems are a common complaint in most older persons. The brain has two kinds of memory – recent and remote (old). Recent memory includes facts or events that occurred within the last hour so, while remote (old) memory is facts or events from the distant past, e.g., college memories, high school memories, etc. Recent memory is like a computer workstation while remote memory or old memory is like the hard disk. The brain remembers facts or events by loading them into recent memory and then moving them to old memory. Your hard disk becomes saturated somewhere around 40 to 60-years of age and after 60 it becomes slightly more difficult to hold on to facts or events. Scientists recognize four general types of memory states for older people: 1) good as new, 2) good as almost new, 3) mild impairment, and 4) dementia. “Good as new” means that you can remember things as well as when you were 20 or 30 years of age. “Good as almost new” means that it’s harder to remember large bodies of information but you can still commit normal amounts of information to memory. Mild cognitive impairment means that memory is impaired to the point where people have difficulty, but they do not have other evidence of dementia. Dementia means that memory is lost and other intellectual functions are also damaged, e.g., communication, motor skills.",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

The diagnosis of panic disorder requires recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and at least one of the following characteristics: persistent concern about having an additional attack (anticipatory anxiety); worry about the implications of an attack or its consequences (e.g., a catastrophic medical or mental consequence) and making a significant change in behavior as a consequence of the attacks. A variety of pharmacologic interventions is available, as are non-pharmacologic cognitive or cognitive-behavioral therapies that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of panic disorder. Early detection and thoughtful selection of appropriate first-line interventions can help these patients, who often have been impaired for years, regain their confidence and ability to function in society.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

These drugs cause emotions to be amplified, the ego to dissolve, and sensory vividness to increase—a phenomenon called “tripping” that entails hazards including anxiety and perceptual distortions, but they can also promote empathy, creativity, and psychological openness. Emerging research highlights that the destabilization of the brain’s default mode network can have prosocial effects but also potentially impair judgement, affecting mental health.",

The most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis in childhood are food, insect venom, drugs, exercise, etc. In some cases, the presence of more than one trigger is necessary for the allergic reaction, while one trigger alone is tolerated. This rare condition is called summation anaphylaxis (SA). Food‐dependent exercise‐induced anaphylaxis is the most well‐known SA. However, SA may also occur with the association between food and/or exercise plus one or more of the following other cofactors, such as drugs, especially non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAID), alcohol, infections, temperature variation, and menstrual cycle. SA can explain some cases of idiopathic anaphylaxis, as well as cases of an apparent breakdown in a previously acquired tolerance for food, or finally, when faced with a suggestive clinical history of food allergy or exercise anaphylaxis and the provocation test is negative. In these situations, a more careful clinical history looking for other cofactors is necessary.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa – reciprocal relationships. A literature review",
      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

In cases of death, it is difficult to relate it to the sexual practice itself. Suicide and homicide are the main differential diagnoses. Closely related derivatives of asphyxiophilic sex are anesthesiophilia (inhalation of variable volatile substances) and electrophilia (use of electric current during sexual activity)--both also intended to enhance the sexual stimulation.

Apparently this effect is transient, and the injury is supposed to be indicated by the repetition of the functional disturbances.

      "abstract": "Executive summary:  Frailty is when the body gradually loses its in-built reserve and becomes vulnerable to sudden changes in health triggered by stress or minor illness such as a urinary tract infection.  Frailty increases the risk of unfavourable health outcomes including falls, disability, admission to hospital, need for long-term care, poorer recovery and reduced quality of life compared to those who are not frail.  Prefrailty is an intermediate stage between non-frail and frail, with loss of in-built reserves but the ability to recover after a stressor event.  The prefrail have more than twice the risk of becoming frail compared to those who are non-frail.  Evidence suggests the ‘prefrail’ state may be a window of opportunity for effective interventions.  Potential interventions include physical activity alone or in combination with nutrition and/or brain training.  Evidence for interventions targeting other aspects of frailty such as cognition, social outcomes and psychosocial wellbeing (depression and loneliness) is limited but have been advocated.  The use of Information Communication Technology (ICT)/eHealth in frailty interventions demonstrates potential for self-management, improved health and cost effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Objetivo: Analisar as características do Transtorno de Estresse Pós-Traumático (TEPT). Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

Taste distortion or loss involves an impairment of this interaction and may be defined as dysgeusia (taste distortion), hypogeusia (reduced ability to taste), or ageusia (complete inability to taste). Medications have been reported to induce reversible and persistent taste disturbance in many patients. The mechanism by which medications alter taste is unknown, but there are many hypotheses. Patients may react to taste disturbances with decreased appetite, decreased dietary and nutrient intake, and/or increased use of salt or sugar. Management of taste disorders often includes discontinuation of the suspected offending agent. Clinicians should be proactive in identifying patients with taste alterations and in responding with appropriate interventions.",

      "abstract": "Background: Compared to other psychotic disorders, there is little information about staging care in delusional disorder (DD). Unlike schizophrenia, this is a disorder that begins in middle age, a time at which chronic medical comorbidities have already begun to impact global functioning. With age, the combination of psychological and somatic conditions leads to new behaviours, e.g., agitation, aggression, and behaviours that require specific preventive and interventive measures. With further age, knowledgeable end-of-life care becomes necessary for this population. Aim: The aim of this article was to review existing evidence on the management of these successive phases. Methods: We conducted a narrative review using PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov and searched for the following terms: (agitation OR aggressivity OR aggression OR palliative OR “end-of-life”) AND (“delusional disorder”). Results: We found that the literature was sparse. Existing evidence suggests that medical causes are frequently at the root of agitation and aggression. With respect to management, de-escalation strategies are generally preferred over pharmacotherapy. Specific delusional syndromes, e.g., de Clérambault, Othello, Capgras, Fregoli, as well as folie à deux, are associated with aggression. The somatic subtype of DD is the one most often requiring palliative care at the end of life. Conclusions: We conclude that insufficient attention has been given to the care needs of the accelerated aging process in DD.",

      "title": "Estudio comparativo de la acción psicofarmacológica y analgésica de extractos de plantas de uso terapéutico tradicional con antidepresivos inhibidores selectivos de la recaptación de monoaminas",
      "abstract": "El dolor es una manifestacion clinica frecuente cuyo tratamiento esta lejos de ser optimo, aunque en los ultimos anos se han producidos avances muy significativos. A esto hay que sumar el hecho de que el dolor suele acompanarse de otras enfermedades comorbidas entre las que destacan la depresion, la ansiedad, el deterioro cognitivo y las alteraciones del sueno. Los antidepresivos son farmacos frecuentemente utilizados en el tratamiento del dolor, bien solos o en combinacion con otros analgesicos. Su utilizacion se debe principalmente a dos motivos: por su accion analgesica en algunos cuadros clinicos de dolor neuropatico, y por sus propiedades antidepresivas, logicamente, e incluso ansioliticas en algunos casos. Hasta el momento, no se conoce con exactitud el mecanismo de accion por el cual los antidepresivos producen su efecto analgesico, ni tampoco las diferencias entre ellos en el contexto del dolor. Centrandonos en las investigaciones preclinicas, es necesario de cara a un futuro desarrollo de nuevos farmacos antidepresivos analgesicos, conocer la sensibilidad de los diferentes modelos de dolor a los mecanismos especificos de accion antidepresiva. Los antidepresivos con alguna excepcion suelen ejercer su accion farmacologica inhibiendo la recaptacion de monoaminas, concretamente serotonina y noradrenalina, y este mismo mecanismo parece ser el que les concede actividad analgesica. Asimismo, este mecanismo les hace poseer accion ansiolitica. Es necesario por tanto en psicofarmacologia preclinica, discernir sobre la capacidad de los diferentes antidepresivos para inducir efecto antidepresivo, analgesico y ansiolitico en diferentes metodos que puedan servir para orientar la investigacion futura en este campo. Tambien es necesario conocer su capacidad de producir efectos sobre la cognicion ya que su uso cronico puede derivar en un deterioro cognitivo . Un aspecto de gran importancia y que ha constituido uno de los objetivos de esta tesis es saber el rango de potencia en relacion con la dosificacion de los antidepresivos y su mecanismo de accion como agentes capaces de inducir efecto analgesico y ansiolitico. Es decir, es importante conocer si las dosis a las que se evidencia un efecto analgesico son las mismas a las que se observa un efecto ansiolitico y tambien relacionar este orden de potencia con los efectos cognitivos. Como quiera que el mecanismo de accion de los antidepresivos esta relacionado con la inhibicion de la recaptacion de serotonina y noradrenalina y que los rangos de potencia para inducir este efecto son diferente entre ellos, es de importancia saber que modelos son mas sensibles a un mecanismo u otro. Es decir, es de interes conocer que modelos son mas especificos para detectar un efecto serotoninergico o noradrenergico o los dos, en relacion con el efecto antidepresivo, ansiolitico, analgesico y cognitivo. Tambien es importante, puesto que la mayor parte de los modelos son interferidos por la posible capacidad que tienen los antidepresivos de producir cambios en la motricidad, conocer si los efectos que observamos estan o no relacionados con estos cambios motores, con el fin de no inducirnos a error en futuras investigaciones.",

The neuroanatomy remains poorly defined but three levels seem likely: a) a cortical level; b) a bulbar, or effector, level; and 3) a synkinetic, or integrative, level probably at or near the hypothalamus. Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions. What brings these together is their clinical similarity and probable disinhibition at higher brainstem levels.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

In the assessment of cognitive functioning in the elderly, there are at least four ways in which a model or theoretical approach is useful for differentiating among the disorders affecting the elderly. Neuropsychology plays an especially important role in the diagnosis of disorders in the elderly whenever cognitive functioning has been compromised. The medical and psychiatric history included marked anxiety presenting early and consistently in the disorder, outstanding memory disorder with the eventual development of a dementia, seizures, abnormal EEG, and a secondary carcinoma in the lung. The stage model has the potential for confirming or disconfirming a diagnosis because deviations from the predicted pattern of regression would signify that a different disorder is present.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.",

Many of these controversies may be avoided by taking a goal-oriented approach to treatment, in which clinical objectives are defined, and both medications and psychological interventions are used to facilitate progress towards these. The effectiveness of medications is maximized when they are used as one component of a comprehensive treatment plan. There are no ‘magic bullets’ in addiction treatment—the same pharmacological principles apply to these drug treatments as to any other. Drugs need to be given in effective doses, at appropriate intervals, allowed time to reach steady state, and also to dissipate when terminated on the basis of their half-life. Some drugs also have an abuse potential of their own (e.g. opiates, sedative-hypnotics) especially those with a rapid onset of action, and such drugs need to be particularly closely monitored and controlled, to minimize their diversion and misuse.",

      "abstract": "In according to World Health Organization's (WHO) definition, addiction is mentally and sometimes physical condition generated by interaction between living organism and addiction resources (medium). It is characterized by behavior and other mental process which involve coercion for occasional or regular use of addiction resources with intention to experience it's effect on mental process or to avoid discomfort due to absence of such a resource (medium). Psychic (mental) addiction is characterized by feeling of satisfaction and will for drug re-consummation to cause comfort and avoid discomfort. Physical addiction is defined as a condition of adjustment on drugs followed by need for increase of dose to achieve its effect as it was in the beginning with smaller quantity and with occurrence of abstinence crisis in absence of drugs. Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living. Such different addictions have and different importance, influence and consequences and addiction does not have to be necessarily negative phenomenon although it is mostly considered and judged as such.

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Converging evidence from multiple countries exists across epidemiological, longitudinal, experimental, and meta‐analytic studies. Addiction is associated with numerous forms and severities of violence. Alcohol has the strongest and largest body of evidence as a (potentially causal) risk factor for violence. Stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamines are also consistently found to be related to violence. Most major violence risk assessment instruments incorporate some index of addiction or other substance‐related problem as a risk factor. Four main explanatory models—psychopharmacological, systemic, economic compulsion, interactional—for the link between addiction and other substance‐related problems are reviewed.",

The administration of Ca lactate improved hypocalcemia and muscle cramps, but not the other symptoms. An addition of Mg sulfate did not change the clinical condition and the serum electrolyte level. From these findings a relation of chronic alcohol intake to the imbalance of serum electrolytes as well as a low level of serum parathyroid hormone was discussed, and a pathogenetic mechanism of dementia observed in this case was speculated.",

Many of the same effects are reported in normals after harmine and Nalline (other workers). unlike mescaline and LSD at usual dosage levels, the present psychotomimetics regularly produce drowsiness and sleep along with the aberrant mental effects. The resultant state is partly that of \"hypnagogic\" visual hallucinations or imagery. The results with increased dosage suggest that the basic effect of these agents is to produce an acute toxic reaction type. The difference between them and mescaline or LSD with respect to clouding of consciousness and certain aspects of the hallucinogenic response may be quantitative rather than qualitative. The indole nucleus is not necessary in the structure of psychotomimetics since Win-2299 and Nalline are non-indoles. The tertiary nitrogen grouping may contribute to certain aspects of psychotomimetic action.",

The most familiar are the \"visionary psychodysleptics\" which produce prominent visual and somatic distortions and hallucinations. Complex emotional changes ranging from ecstasy to terror may occur, as well as alterations in thinking. Examples of such drugs are LSD, mescaline, and tryptamine derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The imagery-producing psychodysleptics such as cannabis and various coumarins (e.g., from Calea zacatechichi) potentiate visual imagery and produce characteristic distortions in time perception, body-image, and thought. Trance-producing psychodysleptics (such as lysergic acid amide (obtained from Rivea corymbosa) ololiquhqui, turbicoryn, and corymbosine), as their names suggest, produce trance-like states. Finally the deliriants (e.g., atropine) produce clouding of consciousness and amnesia, as well as hallucinatory effects.",

Supone la primera causa entre los pa- cientes que se suicidan a esta edad, genera gran sufrimiento en el propio paciente y en su familia, y es fuente de importante discapaci- dad por la propia enfermedad y por la reper- cusion en la evolucion de otras enfermedades comorbidas. Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta. En este articulo se pretende revisar las posibles evolu- ciones y sus opciones terapeuticas, abordar si existe riesgo de encarnizamiento terapeutico, y finalizar con algunas cuestiones de la vida de estos pacientes que influyen en el afronta- miento de la enfermedad EnglishDepression is the most frequent psychia- tric illness in elderly patients. It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

Aspects of behavior not meeting these criteria but relevant to a study of aggression should be described using appropriate terms such as social dominance, initiative, etc. With these conventions, examination of the heterogeneous literature on lithium treatment of aggression demonstrates that lithium ion exerts an antiaggressive effect in man. A number of hypotheses for the antiaggressive effect are examined using previous studies and new behavioral and biochemical data. It is concluded that the antiaggressive effect is not due to any of the following: lithium toxicity or side effects; subjective or objective weakness; increased reaction time; reduced coordination or motor performance; frank cognitive deficits; hypothyroidism; reduction of serum testosterone; placebo effect; or underlying manic‐depressive illness. Putative “thymoleptic” properties of lithium are too ambiguous to constitute an explanation of lithium's actions in man.",

      "abstract": "The pattern of adverse drug reactions in elderly is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from that in younger patients. This relates to age-associated changes in physiology, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The combination of several risk factors including the use of several drugs concurrently is of special importance in the elderly. Extreme pharmacokinetic variations due to genetic polymorphism in drug action, may, although not in itself age-related, cause particular problems in the elderly. The best-studied drug oxidation polymorphism, related to the model substances sparteine and debrisoquine, is important for several types of drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, several neuroleptics and several other types of drugs. Sparteine/debrisoquine-poor metabolizers will with standard doses of tricyclic antidepressants or neuroleptics develop very high steady-state blood levels, and this may cause particular problems in the elderly. There are several examples of how the genetic polymorphism may influence the kinetics of a drug, and some of these are or may become relevant for the psychopharmacology of the elderly.",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy.

      "title": "Newer oral atypical antipsychotic agents: a review.",
      "abstract": "Antipsychotic drugs are commonly prescribed for a variety of psychiatric conditions. In addition to individuals with schizophrenia, the original target patient population, several antipsychotic medications are widely used for bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, delirium, insomnia, agitation, and aggression in various patient types. Despite their important role in the treatment of psychotic and other illnesses, these medications have some shortcomings. Some patients with psychosis fail to respond to treatment, or they may respond incompletely. Some patients experience neurological events such as extrapyramidal side effects or, more rarely, tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is another rare but potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with antipsychotic drugs.\r\n\r\nRecently, the antipsychotic medications (particularly the atypical, “second-generation” antipsychotics) have come under scrutiny because of an increased risk of weight gain and metabolic adverse effects (AEs), such as glucose intolerance and lipid abnormalities. These AEs have the potential to increase the risk of type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease as well as morbidity and mortality rates related to these conditions.1 Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed “off-label” for the management of agitation and psychosis in patients with dementia without an approved FDA indication. The use of these medications in elderly dementia patients has become controversial and has been reported by the FDA to increase the risk of cerebrovascular events as well as the all-cause death rate among these patients, leading to the advent of “black-box” warnings for all antipsychotic drugs.2\r\n\r\nAntipsychotic agents may be classified in several ways. Commonly, they can be designated as older drugs (often called conventional or “typical” antipsychotics) and newer “atypicals.” The term atypical refers to the perceived lower likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms, a sequela that had been deemed characteristic of the first generation of antipsychotic drugs. The atypicals are widely prescribed based on the perception that they are more effective and produce fewer side effects than the typicals, even though some atypicals are much more expensive.\r\n\r\nCATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness), a large study published in 2005, cast doubt on the relative overall effectiveness of the atypicals, which seemed to perform no better than perphenazine (formerly Trilafon, Schering-Plough), an older, less expensive typical antipsychotic medication.3 Some observers have suggested a return to the use of the less expensive typical medications. In this setting, the field is in need of better agents to bring about improved antipsychotic effects, a lower rate of refractory illness, and reduced both metabolic and neurological side effects.\r\n\r\nThe atypical antipsychotics include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), and aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka). Clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis) is usually included in this list as the prototypical agent, although its potential for bone marrow suppression sets it apart.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of aripiprazole in 2002, there has been a relative hiatus in the development of new atypical antipsychotic drugs. In this article, we review four oral atypical antipsychotic agents introduced since 2007: paliperidone (Invega, Ortho-McNeil-Janssen), iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda), asenapine (Saphris, Organon), and lurasidone (Latuda, Sunovion). We discuss their classification, indications, mechanism of action, clinical trials, efficacy, adverse effects, comparisons with other antipsychotics, new indications being sought, dosing and administration, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, contraindications, FDA warnings, and drug–drug interactions. We excluded antipsychotic agents that are currently under investigation and those that have not yet been approved by the FDA.\r\n\r\nWe conducted a Medline search for the terms paliperidone, iloperidone, asenapine, and lurasidone to identify efficacy and tolerability trials for each drug. Product information and results from unpublished studies were obtained from the manufacturers.",

Many types of medicaments can cause akathisia as an adverse event of their use and they include: antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, antihistamines, and psychoactive substances. We will present the case of a 50 year old patient, treated on two occasions for psychotic depression. During the second hospitalization it is possible that antipsychotic treatment combined with an antidepressant caused akathisia or there were symptoms of agitated depression and akathisia present at the same time, which is very difficult to determine in everyday clinical practice. We can conclude that in this case, as in many others, akathisia as a possible adverse effect of psychopharmacs was very hard to identify. Therefore, it is necessary to have akathisia in mind when using certain medicaments, especially when combining several that use the same enzymatic system and consequently raise levels of at least one of them.",

Despite returning to baseline after several days to weeks, patients can suddenly decompensate, exhibiting what is called postictal psychosis despite being abstinent from the substance. This condition can lead to chronic psychosis if not properly treated. In this case, a male in his twenties, presented with 1 month of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. After his last cocaine use 1 month ago, the patient developed seizure-like activity and shortly after returned to baseline. Approximately 1 week later, the patient started to experience psychosis. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted and started on Risperidone 2mg twice a day but did not respond. Clonazepam 1mg twice a day was added, which helped patient to return to baseline. Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is underreported, and it can be difficult to recognize. Similarly, there are few guidelines as to how to treat this condition. Clinicians need to rapidly address if they suspect that the patient is experiencing possible postictal psychosis given that this can lead to chronic psychosis.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

Some more recently recognized or often overlooked side effects of antidepressants are also discussed, as well as differential side effect profiles. The second generation antidepressants are critiqued and are generally believed to be no better than many of the first generation antidepressants. The usefulness of and indications for tricyclic serum levels and standard neuroendocrine tests for depression are summarized. Recent findings regarding lithium, including augmentation, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, especially for atypical depressions with panic symptoms, are included, as is the use of psychostimulants, especially for medically ill patients who cannot take other antidepressants.",

MDD is characterised by periods of depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure that lasts at least two weeks. These symptoms are accompanied by a number of somatic symptoms (changes in sleep, libido, energy and vigour, appetite and psychomotor function, etc) as well as cognitive symptoms (feelings of worthlessness, concentration or decision making difficulty, poor concentration and suicidal thoughts) that cause clinically significant distress or impairment of everyday functionality.",

We present a subgroup of patients with the following pattern of symptoms and historical detail: (1) severe sexual and physical abuse by family members; (2) relatively good premorbid professional and marital adjustment (considering later difficulties) though characterized by (3) hypomania, binge eating, and morbid obesity. A pronounced shift in eating behaviors follows (4) medical trauma (e.g., injury, cancer, surgery) that occurs after age 30, interrupts previous hypomanic adaptation, and leads to severe restriction, purging, and dramatic weight loss (e.g., 100 lb). Although only one patient met full criteria for anorexia nervosa, weight loss and starvation were serious enough to provoke further medical crises in all patients. Finally, (5) during both weight loss and weight restoration patients demonstrated significant dissociative disturbance, including dissociated mood and personality states (i.e., multiple personality disorder), self-destructive behavioral episodes repeating early trauma, and avoidance of food as a way to manage PTSD symptoms. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Es por esto último que la prevención es aún más efectiva a esta edad. Las drogas de abuso alteran principalmente el sistema mesocorticolimbico; la dopamina y el glutamato desempeñan un papel importante en este circuito que normalmente median comportamientos de motivación. Se cree que las sustancias de abuso modifican este circuito usando mecanismos similares al aprendizaje normal resultando en aprendizaje disfuncional. Dichos cambios son a largo plazo y pueden ser evocados por eventos que recuerden la droga, en la ausencia de la misma. Un manejo multidisciplinario es necesario ya que el abuso de drogas tiene componentes biológicos, sociales y psicológicos.

The wide variety of seemingly unrelated independent stereotypies generated by central stimulants is also puzzling. In rodents, for instance, drugs such as apomorphine and amphetamine have been reported to elicit climbing, jumping, rearing, prancing, running, walking, circling, revolving, pivoting, gnawing, licking, nose-poking, sniffing, verticalization, side-to-side head and paw movements, backward locomotion, and underwater swimming without surfacing (e.g. Alander etal.1983; Cole 1977; Costall and Naylor 1973; Decsi et al.1979; Fray et al.1980; Janssen et al.1960; Jerussi and Glick 1976; Kokkinidis and Anisman 1979; Schijljrring 1971; Schoenfeld et al.1975; Segal et al.1980; Szechtman et al.1982; Teitelbaum 1986; Thomas and Handley 1978; Voigtlander eta/.1975).

Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

The way of life of the individual who is dependent on alcohol is replete with incidents that are demoralising, waking daily with a hangover or with tremor and retching, coupled with amnesia for events of the night before, a sense of inability to face the day ahead and awareness of recriminations at work and at home. Little wonder that depressed mood is common in such circumstances. Similarly, the drug addict, when life is dominated by the daily problem of obtaining supplies of a substance that brings transient relief or pleasure but also experiences of an impoverished existence and low mood. Add to this the fact that the biological action of many commonly misused substances can induce depression then it is hardly surprising that depression is common in this population. There are also a smaller number who use alcohol or illicit drugs to cope with primary depression. Teasing out the interplay of affect and substance misuse is a challenge for the general psychiatrist and the addiction specialist.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Alcoholic hallucinosis is a rare complication of chronic alcohol abuse, characterized by acoustic verbal hallucinations and delusions, mainly of a menacing content, arising in clear consciousness, that appear during or shortly after a period of heavy alcohol consumption. Objectives and aims To outline the key clinical features of alcoholic hallucinosis in order to improve differential diagnosis with other entities. Methods We studied the evolution of an outpatient followed in a Mental Health Centre of Valladolid and compared it with present data about the condition, found in a bibliographic search of articles no older than 10 years about the topic. Results Partial insight about the experience, along with clear consciousness, was key to discard other psychiatric diagnosis that also present acoustic hallucinations. Neuroimagining and functional tests in our patient showed moderate cognitive impairment and cortical atrophy, which contradicts other studies which claim that an acceptable level of cognition must be present in order to gain the necessary insight to meet the diagnostic criteria. Conclusions Alcoholic hallucinosis is a rare form of subacute encephalopathy, secondary to an abrupt stop in a previously chronic and heavy alcohol consumption. Its diagnosis is mainly clinical, and neuroleptics are the most used drug, being abstinence essential for an adequate evolution. The course is usually benign, although the acoustic phenomena may not disappear completely. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome: Outpatient Management.",
      "abstract": "Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death. The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale. Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate long-term treatment for alcohol use disorder, including pharmacotherapy, in addition to withdrawal management.",

Living with and experiencing mental health problems can be disabling for the person, cause great anguish and frustration and may lead a person to the brink of despair and desperation. The stigma attached to someone experiencing mental health problems can sometimes be just as debilitating as the label of mental illness. Common mental health problems are sometimes described as 'less serious conditions'. Statistics for mental health–substance use problems have identified an increase in people seeking help, advice and treatment. Professionals working within mental health services should always ask about alcohol use and complete a risk assessment. There are many social problems associated with heavy or binge drinking and this may lead to mental health problems such as anxiety, depression or suicidal thoughts. People present differently and they will have various tolerance levels and a variety of mental health problems.",

Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep at night for many hours or inability to have a sound sleep, which deprives one of natural rest and interferes with activities during the day. Each of us has suffered a restless night at some point in our lives. We’ve all occasionally sacrificed sleep for a cram session before an exam, or an important deadline. Many of us also know the feeling of losing sleep due to an intense emotional upset or the accumulation of stress or anxiety. For some of us, loss of sleep is short-lived; for others, it is chronic and we’ve come to anticipate losing sleep on a regular basis. Insomnia can be caused by elevated or chronic stress, illness, physical discomfort, environmental factors, changes in our schedules, side effects from prescribed medications, depression, anxiety, and…",

Culture filtrate (0.22 microns porosity filters, > 250 toxic flagellated cells/ml) induces formation of open ulcerative sores, hemorrhaging, and death of finfish and shellfish. Human exposure to aerosols from ichthyotoxic cultures (> or = 2000 cells/ml) has been associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation with reddening and blurred vision (hours to days); autonomic nervous system dysfunction [localized sweating, erratic heart beat (weeks)]; central nervous system dysfunction [sudden rages and personality change (hours to days), and reversible cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling or numbness in lips, hands, and feet; months to years). Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients. Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have been tracked to fish kill sites in eutrophic estuaries from Delaware Bay through the Gulf Coast. Our data point to a critical need to characterize their chronic effects on human health as well as fish recruitment, disease resistance, and survival.",

Differential diagnosis Ingestion of nutrients can occur in the course of other mental disorders (for example, a pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia), mental retardation, in the Kleine–Levin syndrome… In these cases, should only be established an additional diagnosis of pica if the feeding behavior is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Conclusions Pica disorder has been studied by pediatricians, gynecologists, dermatologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, nutritionists, anthropologists, etc., which has been interpreted as a conduct disorder, food, mental illness, poverty, hunger… but really the cause it is unknown.

There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

Specific treatment (if any) will depend upon the particular cause of coma, but—whatever the cause—long-term attention is required to the patient’s respiration, skin, circulation, and bladder and bowel function, seizures must be controlled, and the level of consciousness should be regularly assessed and monitored.",

      "abstract": "Patient Scenario: An adolescent female youth soccer athlete, with a previous concussion history, suffered a second concussion 4 wk ago. Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

      "title": "Refining cause of death attribution among opioid, opioid‐stimulant and stimulant acute toxicity deaths",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Deaths attributed to a combination of opioids and stimulants have risen dramatically in recent years, largely attributed to fentanyl, yet little is understood about which drug class is primarily responsible. Attributing death to acute substance toxicity is complex and lacks clear standards. We aimed to determine whether additional causes of death and other significant conditions among deaths attributed to fentanyl were similar regardless of stimulant involvement, and distinct from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. Design Cross‐sectional analysis using records from the California Electronic Death Registration System. Setting and cases Unintentional acute toxicity deaths involving fentanyl or stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) occurring in San Francisco, USA, during 2013–2023. Measurements We compared demographic characteristics and causes of death or other significant conditions (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical cause, or no other additional cause) among five mutually exclusive groups of deaths: stimulants without opioids (stimulant‐only), fentanyl with stimulants (fentanyl‐stimulant), fentanyl without stimulants (fentanyl‐only), other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone) with stimulants (“other opioid‐stimulant”), and other opioids without stimulants (“other opioids‐only”). We conducted separate unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical, or no additional cause). The primary analysis included results for the fentanyl groups. Findings Of 4475 deaths attributed to acute opioid and/or stimulant toxicity, 24% involved stimulants‐only, 45% fentanyl‐stimulants, and 12% fentanyl‐only; the remaining 20% involved other opioids. Stimulant‐only decedents were the oldest (mean age 54 years), followed by fentanyl‐stimulant (47 years) and fentanyl‐only (44 years; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The adjusted odds of having cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other medical causes of death (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] from 0.03 to 0.52, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] from 0.01 to 0.68) were lower and the odds of no additional cause of death (aORs from 2.53 to 3.31, with 95% CIs from 2.00 to 3.40) were higher for both groups of deaths involving fentanyl compared with deaths attributed to stimulants‐only. There were no statistically significant differences in causes of death when comparing fentanyl‐only with fentanyl‐stimulant deaths. Findings were similar for other opioid deaths. Conclusion In San Francisco, USA, causes of death and other significant condition characteristics among deaths attributed to fentanyl appear to be similar regardless of the involvement of stimulants, but are markedly different from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. When reporting on drug‐related mortality and developing interventions, deaths attributed to a combination of fentanyl and stimulants may be appropriately considered in the context of opioid overdose prevention, while deaths attributed to stimulants without opioids may require a response focused on preventing and treating underlying chronic medical conditions.",

      "abstract": "El delirio de relacion sensitivo representa un tipo determinado de enferme­ dad o un tipo reactivo paranoico bien caracterizado por su etiologia, sus sintomas y la forma de su evolucion. Principales signos etiologicos: 1. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo se presenta con mas frecuencia sobre un fondo hereditario muy acentuado en individuos que muestran marcada debilidad de orden reactivo y, a veces, de orden endogeno. 2. o La constitucion psicopatica se resalta, en su aspecto biologico general, ante todo por su gran fatigabilidad. El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga. La neurosis de relacion sensi­ tiva se diferencia de la variante obsesiva del caracter sensitivo por el contraste mas acentuado de tensiones interiores. La personalidad de un neurotico sensitivo presenta, por una parte, una suavidad extrema, una debilidad, una sutileza, una vulnerabilidad y, por otra parte, un cierto grado de ambicion, de conciencia en si y de tenacidad. Los representantes mas perfilados de este grupo caracterial son individuos complicados, de elevada inteligencia y de gran valor; poseen una sen­ sibilidad fina y profunda, y poseen una etica escrupulosa. Su vida psiquica inte­ riorizada e hipersensible hace que sean presa facil para las pruebas banales de la vida. Ocultan profundamente sus afectos, y los ocultan durante mucho tiempo. Se analizan y se critican con refinamiento. Son muy susceptibles y tenaces, pero",

Several recent studies demonstrate the efficacy of the drug for certain behavioral and affective disorders in children.1 There is also evidence that lithium may be therapeutic in a diverse group of clinical problems including premenstrual syndrome, neutropenia, cluster headaches, certain movement disorders, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.2-6 Thus, it appears that lithium use will increase, resulting in its greater availability for accidental poisoning. Currently, this is a rare event. A recent literature review disclosed no reports of single-dose intoxications either in childhood or manifesting as dystonia.

Hay indicadores de que hay alguna relacion entre las alucinaciones y las reacciones psiquiatricas de desconsuelo y parece ser que algunos individuos tienen una predisposicion especial a alucinar. Parecen tener una labilidad especial en los sistemas que mantienen los niveles adecuados de conciencia, y esto, asociado con los cambios de humor, los puede llevar a experimentar alucinaciones en estado de vigilia.

      "title": "Defining Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract An occasion of drug taking may be a passing indulgence of an adolescent, perhaps initiated in a moment of immature judgment. All too often, the drug taking can become repetitive and may lead to a syndrome of abuse or addiction, possibly in an interaction of inherited vulnerability traits with environmental conditions and processes. The development of addiction and the dependence syndrome in adolescents are emotion-laden, controversial, and often misunderstood topics. Public opinion leaders often do not appreciate the scientific evidence that tends to favor a disease concept of addiction or dependence on alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs such as cocaine or cannabis. This evidence includes a neuronal basis for many of the prominent clinical features of dependence, genetic vulnerability, and a characteristic chronic, relapsing course that resembles that of many medical illnesses. Unfortunately, these biological bases of addiction are often forgotten or misunderstood by a nonetheless opinionated American public that can view adolescent drug problems as purely behavioral and morally objectionable. Consequently, many affected adolescents end up being managed by their parents, school authorities, or the judicial system rather than being treated in specialized adolescent treatment programs. Even those seeking treatment often discover that appropriate programs do not exist in their geographic region or are difficult to access because of low capacity or managed care policies. While there would be a public uproar if treatment were not available to adolescents with head injuries, diabetes, or cancer, obvious disparities in addiction treatment have been tolerated for decades and may well reflect public skepticism about the biological bases of drug dependence and addiction. Unfortunately,we have much to learn about the onset, nature, and treatment of these conditions in adolescents. It is our contention that gaps in our knowledge should be addressed with research and clinical experience, and not cited to justify an inadequate treatment infrastructure.",

Psychoanalytic observation of psychosomatic patients (and others as well) reveals that the inability to name, recognize, contain or work through one's affective states is frequently one manifestation of defensive structures of a psychotic kind (more radical than denial which deals with certain neurotic anxieties). Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience.

Muitos trabalhos têm demonstrado que as bases neurais da dependência à nicotina são semelhantes àquelas das outras drogas de abuso. A nicotina induz preferência condicionada por lugar e auto-administração e, portanto, atua como reforçador positivo, esse efeito parece ser mediado pelo sistema dopaminérgico mesolímbico. A nicotina também induz à sensibilização comportamental que é provavelmente resultante de alterações da expressão gênica do núcleo acumbens induzidas pela exposição prolongada a essa substância. A suspensão do uso de nicotina resulta em síndrome de abstinência. As evidências indicam que esses sinais e sintomas sejam mediados por receptores colinérgicos nicotínicos centrais e periféricos. Outros neurotransmissores, como por exemplo a serotonina e os peptídeos opióides, também podem estar envolvidos na mediação da dependência e síndrome de abstinência à nicotina. A revisão da literatura mostra a complexidade dos efeitos da nicotina no organismo. A integração entre as abordagens comportamental, neuroquímica e molecular possibilitará a compreensão dos mecanismos neurais da dependência ao tabaco e fornecerá as bases para o desenvolvimento racional de agentes terapêuticos que possam ser utilizados para o tratamento da dependência e síndrome de abstinência ao tabaco.",

      "abstract": "In the perinatal period, fathers may also suffer from depression, referred to as paternal perinatal depression. Studies have shown that the prevalence of paternal perinatal depression is considerably higher than in the general adult population. For example, a meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression among fathers was 9.76% during the prenatal period and 8.75% during the postpartum year.1 Paternal perinatal depression can deteriorate the marital relationship and generate psychosocial and behavioral problems in the offspring (Ramchandani et al., 2021).2 However, paternal perinatal depression has received comparatively little clinical attention. A review of the literature on this subject will list the biological, psychological and social risk factors for this condition, which include a history of depression or anxiety disorders, lack of social support, conflicts in the couple's relationship, economic and labor problems. The clinical characteristics of depression share similarities with depressions in other periods of life, and there are differential clinical features, such as anger, aggressiveness, somatic symptoms and greater comorbidity with substance abuse disorder. Early detection with scales such as the Edinburgh, Gotland and PAPA and the appropriate approach are fundamental to mitigate the effects of paternal perinatal depression. Psychotherapeutic support, psychoeducation of the disorder, and self-care tools can be part of a comprehensive approach to help parents experiencing this condition. In conclusion, the proposal to include this disorder within the parental perinatal affective disorders, as proposed by the author Baldoni,3 given the level of overlap that it usually has with other comorbid conditions (anxiety, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders) and high frequency of masked symptoms, goes in the direction to give the attention it deserves for early detection and provide adequate support and treatment.",

      "abstract": "一、 药物滥用是一种慢性、复发性脑疾病。药物滥用将导致药物成瘾（addiction），其主要表现有药物依赖、药物耐受、药物敏感化以及药物停用后的戒断症状（withdraw symptom）。药物成瘾的核心特征是强迫性觅药和用药行为。药物成瘾会导致药物滥用者认知功能的损伤和认知偏差，并会造成滥用者情绪异常。药物成瘾是一个复杂的生物学过程，有着及其复杂的机理。对药物成瘾机制的解释有很多种，主要认为成瘾过程是一种学习记忆过程，学习记忆的机制在药物成瘾过程中起到了非常重要的作用。首先，学习记忆和药物成瘾过程都受到了相似的神经营养因子以及神经递质系统的调控，例如：它们都受cAMP，CREB等调控因子的调控。其次，研究发现与成瘾相关的线索，如用药有关的人物、地点或暗示等，在药物戒断很长时间后都会恢复吸毒者的用药行为。并且，当把与成瘾相关的线索呈现给毒品戒断中的人时，这些人会出现心率、呼吸加快，血压升高等现象，甚至表现出明显的渴求行为。药物对学习记忆的影响是复杂的，虽然重复使用药物会导致药物成瘾，并且这个过程需要学习记忆机制的参与，但同时使用吗啡却会对其他类型的学习记忆（如：恐惧性学习记忆、一次性被动回避学习记忆和水迷宫空间学习记忆）造成破坏。学习前给予吗啡可以剂量及状态依赖地破坏被动回避试验以及空间辨别试验的记忆获取过程。学习过程结束后立即给予吗啡可以破坏一次性被动回避试验、主动回避试验和恐惧条件化试验的记忆巩固过程。测试前给予吗啡可以破坏空间辨别试验的记忆提取过程。本研究的目的在于更进一步地了解使用吗啡导致吗啡成瘾以及使用吗啡导致学习记忆的各个阶段受损的机制。为此我们采用了药理学以及多种行为学的方法，1、用PTZ诱发的癫痫持续状态干扰吗啡成瘾的学习记忆过程，进一步比较了吗啡成瘾的学习记忆与其他学习记忆，例如：空间学习记忆以及食物奖赏学习记忆的机制有何异同；2、研究了β-肾上腺素系统与阿片系统在空间记忆巩固过程中的相互作用；3、我们还研究了NMDA受体的激动剂和拮抗剂在吗啡破坏空间记忆提取过程中的作用。研究结果发现： 1．戊四唑诱发的癫痫持续状态，对吗啡建立的条件化位置偏好没有任何影响，动物仍然对阳性箱（吗啡匹配箱）表现出明显的偏好。但是癫痫持续状态破坏了食物建立的条件化位置偏好，并且还破坏了水迷宫和Y迷宫检测的空间记忆。癫痫持续状态破坏了食物建立的条件化位置偏好，原因不是由于其影响了动物的食欲。此外，癫痫持续状态也没有持续地破坏动物的活动能力，因此，对动物活动量的影响也不是造成其他学习记忆破坏的原因。这些结果说明，吗啡成瘾的学习记忆和普通的学习记忆在机制上可能存在不同之处。为了说明这个问题，我们还需要进行其他更深入的研究。 2、训练后立即单独注射吗啡（0.25和2.5 mg/kg）或心得安（2，10和20 mg/kg）都不会破坏动物Y-迷宫空间记忆的巩固过程，动物仍然能识别新异环境，并在里面停留较长时间。但是，训练后同时注射吗啡和心得安却可以破坏动物空间记忆的巩固过程。并且，较高剂量的吗啡（2.5 mg/kg）加上较高剂量的心得安（10和20 mg/kg）对记忆的破坏更严重，实验组动物在新异环境停留的时间显著低于对照组。这说明阿片系统和去甲肾上腺素系统在破坏记忆巩固的过程中可能有协同作用。 3、记忆提取前30分钟注射吗啡（1和10 mg/kg）可以剂量依赖地破坏Y-迷宫空间记忆的提取。单独注射NMDA受体的激动剂NMDA（1，2和4 mg/kg）对动物的空间记忆提取没有影响，但是，单独注射NMDA受体拮抗剂MK-801（0.05，0.1和0.2 mg/kg）剂量依赖地破坏了空间记忆的提取。同时注射吗啡（10 mg/kg）和NMDA（2 mg/kg）可以阻断吗啡对空间记忆造成的破坏作用。相反，共同注射吗啡（1 mg/kg）和MK-801（0.05 mg/kg）可以加重吗啡对空间记忆造成的破坏作用。这说明谷氨酸系统可以干扰吗啡对记忆提取过程的影响。 二、衰老严重地影响了人们的视觉功能，然而眼睛光学系统的老年性改变并不能完全解释清楚这种视觉功能衰退。一般认为是神经系统的退化导致了这种老年性功能降低。但是，研究显示视网膜（retina）和外膝体（dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, dLGN）在衰老的过程中神经元的数量和体积以及神经元的功能特性，如对比度敏感性、空间分辨率等，都没有明显的变化，因此，人们推测老化导致的神经系统的变化发生在更高级的视觉皮层。过去几年的研究发现老年动物视觉皮层细胞发生了一系列反应特性的改变，如：老年动物皮层细胞的方向选择性和方位选择性降低以及细胞反应的潜伏期延长。这些细胞水平的变化被认为是老年性视觉功能衰退的神经机制。为了更全面地了解衰老过程对视觉皮层的影响以及细胞反应改变与整体功能降低之间的关系，本研究采用活体动物细胞外单位记录的方法，比较了青年和老年猕猴初级视觉皮层细胞时间反应特性和空间反应特性的差异。研究结果发现：老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的时间频率和空间频率敏感性明显比年轻动物降低。表现为老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的最优时间和空间频率、空间分辨率（spatial resolution, SR）和较高时间截至频率（high temporal frequency cut-off, TF50）都显著低于年轻动物初级视觉皮层细胞，同时伴随着这些功能的降低，老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的自发放增加，对视觉刺激的反应增加，但是信噪比却显著降低。这些结果表明，老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的功能在老化过程中都普遍降低。这可能是导致老年人视觉功能降低的原因。",

      "title": "Comorbidity in young people: perspectives and challenges",
      "abstract": "Trends in prevalence in substance misuse in young people in the UK are described: increased use over the last decade, the tendency to polydrug use, the narrowing of the gender gap. The complex issues relating to the description, definition and classification, and diagnosis of psychiatric comorbidity and substance misuse are outlined. The fact that there is no uniformly accepted definition of what constitutes ‘dual diagnosis’ or ‘psychiatric comorbidity’ in young people is highlighted: this variability impacts upon clinical assessment and study design. Despite these considerable drawbacks, a degree of consistency is beginning to emerge in the co-occurrence of some conditions, e.g. disruptive and suicidal behaviours. It is recognized that psychological distress and substance misuse are also associated with multiple social and physical complications. The rapid advances in treatment options are presented. At present the ‘best practice’ is implementation of what works for adults with addiction and young people with psychiatric disorder. This includes psychosocial interventions such as motivational enhancement techniques and cognitive behavioural treatment, as well as appropriate safe (usually), short-term use of a range of pharmacological agents. Very few comprehensive designated adolescent addiction services exist, while child and adolescent mental health services are under serious pressure. Thus the need for a longitudinal and multidisciplinary approach, with appropriate assessment instruments in young people, is required to further explore diagnostic classification which will classify the degrees and patterns of relationships between disorders. In this way it may be possible to build up a picture of the nature and extent of numerous complex, and sometimes overlapping, problems and needs in children and adolescents in a variety of settings: primary and secondary care, the criminal justice system and educational establishments. This might strengthen the development of innovative treatment services where novel interventions are tested as a priority.",

La hipertension arterial es asintomatica, razon por la cual el paciente desconoce la severidad de la misma, constituyendose en un factor de riesgo para la salud. Esta enfermedad cardiovascular esta asociada a diversos factores psicologicos, como el estres, la ansiedad, depresion, hostilidad, ira y bajos niveles de apoyo social. Para el tratamiento de esta patologia, se requiere un proceso de implicacion activa por parte del paciente denominado adherencia terapeutica, que le permite al diagnosticado seguir las recomendaciones y adquirir habitos beneficiosos; la falta de adherencia es una de las principales causas del bajo control de la presion arterial. Existen factores que interfieren en este proceso como son: a. los derivados del paciente (psicologicos): ansiedad, estres, trastornos del estado de animo y rasgos de personalidad tipo a, b. los del entorno socio-economico y cultural (apoyo inadecuado), c. los de la enfermedad (asintomatologia y cronicidad) y d. los del tratamiento farmacologico, servicios de salud y personal que atiende al paciente.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl presente articulo tiene como objetivo, establecer la relacion entre los factores psicosociales y las estrategias de afrontamiento empleadas por los pacientes con enfermedad oncologica.

      "abstract": "Introduction The dissociative disorders are characterized by a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior. Objectives We present the case of a 22-year-old patient, who has been following up for just over a year. The patient refers that two people inhabit her body, talk to each other, exchange opinions and both have control over the body, one giving the turn to the other depending on the circumstances. To this is added delusional symptoms of grandeur and sensorial-perceptual symptoms. In turn, depressive symptoms have appeared that have led the patient to have several suicide attempts throughout the follow-up time. Methods During this time, the patient has required hospital admission on two occasions due to the autolytic ideation. Treatment with neuroleptics and antidepressants has been established that have helped control delusions and thoughts of death, but not the dissociative clinic. Results Dissociative Identity disorder 300.14 (F44.81) Conclusions The different symptoms presented by the patient, as well as the social and occupational deterioration that he presents, make this an extremely complicated case, both in diagnosis and in treatment. Dissociative identity disorder has been very controversial, changing its diagnostic criteria over time. More studies are needed and perhaps future research can give us more clues about this disorder.

      "abstract": "The term stands for suicides committed by using more than one method. A distinction can be made between planned and unplanned complex suicides (primary/secondary combinations). In planned complex suicides 2 or more methods are applied simultaneously in order to make sure that death will occur even if one method fails. In unplanned complex suicides the mode of performance is changed after the first method chosen failed or was working too slow or proved to be too painful. In planned complex suicides typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g. ingestion of medicines, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, fall from a height) are combined. But also unusual combinations have been described such as the simultaneous firing of two guns, self-immolation in combination with other suicide methods or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides self-inflicted injuries by sharp force, especially cuts of the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases the suicide switches from cuts to stabs (mostly to the heart region). Other methods often used after the first phase of suicide are hanging and jump from a height. In the literature the use of up to 5 suicidal methods applied one after the other have been described.",

Children born to alcoholic mothers may show a profound mental retardation ranging to an apparent normality, and extending through epilepsy, attention deficit disorders with or without hyperactivity, autism and pervasive developmental disorders, and different types of learning disorders. When adolescents, they may develop different kinds of personality disorders and substance abuse disorders. Finally, in adulthood, they may suffer from different types of affective and psychotic disorders, among others. A great number of those children may not develop their full mental and social potentiality as free individuals. They usually have diverse types of cognitive, attentional, mnemonic and affective impairments. Not infrequently, they engage in antisocial behaviors or have school or work troubles.

      "title": "Bipolar Depression: <i>Best Practices for the Hospitalized Patient</i>",
      "abstract": "One of the most challenging clinical topics in psychiatry is the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar depression. The term mood stabilizer is frequently employed in the treatment of the hospitalized bipolar patient, although clinicians do not universally agree on a consensus definition of this term. Most clinicians would agree that a mood stabilizer refers to a medication that is effective for the acute treatment of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive episodes. Many experts agree that such treatment should offer efficacy against mania, should not worsen depression, and preferably should treat depression as well. In addition, the acute effectiveness in stabilization should not be at the expense of inducing alternate mood symptoms or switching the patient into the alternate phase of illness. From a maintenance standpoint, a mood stabilizer should also prevent against future relapse or recurrence of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive symptoms or episodes (Slide 1). In addition to use of mood stabilizers, there are other issues surrounding treatment of the hospitalized patient with bipolar depression, including the commonly comorbid issue of substance abuse. Hazardous drinking may more commonly occur in bipolar depression or depressive phase of illness, representing a more complex clinical picture. To facilitate understanding of this complex disorder and its appropriate treatment, this discussion centers around the case of a major depressive episode in a patient with a past history of of mania (ie, bipolar I depression or bipolar depression).",

Em algumas pessoas, a enxaqueca pode ser antecedida por sintomas como parestesia, afasia, vertigens e escotoma. Essa condição é denominada como aura, também podendo ser encontrada em outras patologias, como a epilepsia. Considera-se a enxaqueca como uma das vinte doenças mais debilitantes e pode-se relacionar o uso inadequado de medicamentos, absenteísmo, diminuição da produtividade e mudança de humor como fatores impactantes. Tendo na população, uma prevalência de 5-25% em mulheres e 2-10% em homens, sendo que no curso de medicina é de 8,5%. As crises podem ser desencadeadas por fatores ambientais, emocionais ou dietéticos, por exemplo, a mudança de temperatura, alterações hormonais, excesso de exercício físico, automedicação, poluição, uso de contraceptivos, alergias, depressão, queijos e vinho, dentre outros. A vida acadêmica, principalmente no curso de medicina, proporciona inúmeros fatores desencadeantes, como o alto nível de estresse e exigência, acarretando limitações no rendimento durante as crises. O tratamento das crises é feito de maneira emergencial na maioria dos casos, sendo que os pacientes com crises frequentes apresentam geralmente tolerância aos analgésicos comuns. Pacientes com aumento progressivo na frequência de crises, ocorrência de crise uma ou mais vezes por mês, incapacitação devido à dor ou abuso medicamentoso para tratar as crises são recomendados a fazerem tratamento profilático, tratamento que apresenta uma variedade de contraindicações e efeitos colaterais, não sendo eficazes em todos os casos. O objetivo deste trabalho é verificar a prevalência da enxaqueca nos estudantes do curso de medicina do UniFOA e constatar a necessidade da analgesia ao catalogar os principais fármacos utilizados e sua eficácia associada aos principais efeitos colaterais.",

      "title": "Trihexyphenidyl Use Disorder and Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic drug commonly used in treating movement disorders.[1] The widespread use of trihexyphenidyl has led to the exploration of its abuse potential due to its anxiolytic, euphoriant, hallucinogenic, and sexual stimulant effects.[2] It is a popular drug of abuse among the thrill-seeking adolescent male population, used either orally or smoked in a powdered form mixed with tobacco.[3] The prevalence of trihexyphenidyl abuse has been reported to vary from 6.5% to 34% among schizophrenia patients, with doses of trihexyphenidyl abuse varying from 28 mg/day to as high as 200 mg/day.[4] The risk factors for trihexyphenidyl abuse are male gender, unemployment, concomitant use of other illicit substances, family history of substance dependence, long-term use of trihexyphenidyl, and severe mental disorders.[4] The most common aim of abuse is anxiolysis, sedation, or a mood-enhancing euphoric effect to alleviate depressive and negative symptoms.[4] Even though trihexyphenidyl dependence has been previously described, the literature is scanty as it may mimic a primary psychiatric illness leading to misdiagnosis further compounded by a lack of awareness about the drug's abuse potential. We describe a case where prescribed trihexyphenidyl use gradually progressed to a use disorder, leading to social, financial, occupational, and biological dysfunctions. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old male with a history of possible dissociative episodes of unresponsiveness associated with anxiety, currently in remission and off all medications, presented to the psychiatry outpatient department with the inability to stop consuming trihexyphenidyl tablets. For the past 4 years, the patient has had bilateral fine hand tremors, for which tablet trihexyphenidyl was initiated for possible essential tremors, titrated to 4–5 mg per day. After 2 years of regular use, he noticed that his tremor completely resolved after the trihexyphenidyl dose and would aggravate after 4–5 h of the last dose of trihexyphenidyl, along with slurring of speech. Over the next year, the use frequency increased to more than 6–8 mg per day as the duration of relief from tremors decreased with each dose. He started experiencing other difficulties whenever the effect of trihexyphenidyl wore out, such as a generalized feeling of the slowness of movements, stiffness in body parts, difficulty walking, and difficulty in writing. Patient's writing samples, with and without consumption of trihexyphenidyl are attached in Figure 1. Simultaneously, he also noticed that trihexyphenidyl ingestion made him feel energetic, increased his self-confidence, and made him happier. He would get a high with its consumption and described it as if \"everything was possible\" for him. He took trihexyphenidyl first thing in the morning to get out of bed and start his day. He would also spend more money under the effect of trihexyphenidyl than his usual self, would at times be involved in activities that caused him financial harm, such as lending money to people recklessly and also experienced substantially increased libido. Over the next few months, he noticed that after the effects of THP waned off, he would start to experience low mood, reduced interest in carrying out activities, would feel that life is vain, had to struggle with all the movements and started to have suicidal ideations. Later, he started using trihexyphenidyl without prescription at about 10–12 mg per day in divided doses, sourcing it from his workplace pharmacy. He experienced side effects of the medication, like dry mouth, but chose to ignore it to alleviate the depressive symptoms. A representation of illness graph of the patient is given in Figure 2.Figure 1: Handwriting samples of the patient before and after taking a dose of trihexyphenidyl. The image is not reused from any source or copyrightFigure 2: Illness graph of the patient. THP: Trihexyphenidyl, TDS: thrice dailyOn examination, he had fine bilateral hand tremors, the speech was slurred, facial expressions were reduced, gait with a forward stooped posture and bradykinesia. On mental status examination, depressed affect and decreased self-esteem were present. He had taken trihexyphenidyl 4 h before this examination. Various differential diagnoses were considered and ruled out systematically. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was ruled out due to nonspecific motor symptoms and symptom onset only after trihexyphenidyl withdrawal. Drug-induced Parkinson's was ruled out as the current symptoms from the past 4 years have been without the use of any neuroleptics. Vascular Parkinsonism was ruled out due to prominent upper limb involvement and a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Wilson's disease evaluation was negative. With a provisional diagnosis of trihexyphenidyl use disorder based on tolerance, craving, and use despite harm and withdrawals, he was started on tablet escitalopram 5 mg and up-titrated to 10 mg to counter the depressive and anxiety symptoms during withdrawal; tablet propranolol 20 mg was started to manage the tremors, and trihexyphenidyl tapered slowly over 6 months. At the follow-up, he had decreased trihexyphenidyl dose gradually to 2 mg per day without any withdrawal. He maintained well without any tremors. Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication as a case report. DISCUSSION DSM 5 recognizes the antiparkinsonian drugs (including trihexyphenidyl) abuse under the \"other (or unknown) substance use disorder\" category. ICD 10 did not clarify any such category, and ICD 11 describes \"disorder due to use of other specified psychoactive substances including medications.\" However, it does not describe the classes of medications. Hence, whether nonprescription misuse of trihexyphenidyl should be regarded as psychoactive substance use is still questionable. The euphorigenic effects of trihexyphenidyl can be explained by the inhibition of dopamine reuptake and storage consequent to the strong muscarinic receptor blockade[4] as well as its increased affinity for dopamine receptors in the limbic area at higher dosages. Thus, it stimulates the central nervous reward system leading to a \"high.\"[5] Similar stimulant effects have been described with other anticholinergics, such as biperiden and procyclidine.[6] However, tolerance to these effects also develops fast, compelling the patient to increase the doses, which may lead to exaggerating its adverse effects and psychosis-like behavior alterations.[4] This anticholinergic abuse has also been associated with withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs in Parkinson's disease often markedly exacerbates Parkinsonian symptoms, movement disorders,[7] depressive or dysphoric mood symptoms, and even results in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[8] This could be due to acetylcholine receptor hypersensitivity in response to long-term anticholinergic use. The sudden anticholinergic withdrawal might worsen the severity of the symptoms than the initial presentation.[9] A similar phenomenon was observed in our patient, who developed motor symptoms following the discontinuation of trihexyphenidyl. Ruberg et al.[10] in 1982 reported increased acetylcholine receptor densities in the frontal lobes of patients on anticholinergics; similar changes are expected to be seen in nigrostriatal cholinergic receptors.[9] The hypersensitive cholinergic receptor state is similar to the cholinergic excess stage in Parkinsonism, leading to various movement dysfunctions. However, it is essential to mention that going by this mechanism of action, all anticholinergics would have an abuse potential, which is not evident. Therefore, the exact pathophysiological mechanism is yet to be elicited. An image representing possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal is given in Figure 3.Figure 3: Possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal effects. Ach: Acetylcholine, DA: Dopamine, \"rec\": ReceptorsIn this case, evidence suggesting trihexyphenidyl withdrawal-induced movement and mood disorders is the presence of a temporal relationship between trihexyphenidyl dosing and symptom onset which appears to be very similar to the \"on-off\" phenomenon seen with levodopa use in patients of Parkinson's disease. Among various management options, one study suggests tapering 1 mg of trihexyphenidyl every 2 weeks. Another deprescribing guideline by the University of Sydney and Macquarie University recommends a relatively slow tapering, reducing 25% of the daily dose in 1–4 weeks, depending on the nature and severity of withdrawal symptoms, and ending the treatment 2 weeks after giving the lowest dose. Nonpharmacological support such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, exercise, and social support should be given. If tapering is ineffective, consider switching to another anticholinergic agent, with minimal side effects. Tapering off trihexyphenidyl within 3 months of starting has been recommended.[5] Therefore, in light of such reported cases, it is essential to realize that easy affordability, availability, and prolonged prescription would lead to easy escalation of trihexyphenidyl doses leading to potential misuse among patients and this needs to be dealt with caution.

In this chapter, the terms “dual diagnosis,” “substance use disorder[s],” “[name of substance] use,” and/or “[name of substance] dependence” are used. The more modern term “co-occurring disorder” is virtually synonymous with “dual diagnosis,” both of which reference the coexistence of a clinically significant use of drugs and/or alcohol with a primary psychiatric illness (an example of this would be bipolar disorder with cocaine dependence). Of course, a patient can have a substance use disorder (SUD) without having a dual diagnosis – i.e., without a separate, primary psychiatric illness [1]. The assumption is made that, unless mentioned specifically, clinical situations discussed here involve patients who do have a primary psychiatric illness in addition to a SUD. Also, although the fairly recent, though now outdated, DSM-IV criteria differentiated between substance abuse and substance dependence, this volume (again, unless specifically mentioned) does not make that distinction.",

      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "title": "Psychiatric causes of behavioural change in adults less than 65 years old",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mr. Leow, aged 64 years, presents to the polyclinic with a memo from his nursing home stating 3 months of behavioural change. He was observed to have been cleaning his environment excessively, inexplicably even climbing onto the roof in the middle of the night to clean. His restlessness and the ruckus made by him disturb the other residents of the nursing home, and his nurses are finding it difficult to supervise him.WHAT IS ALTERED BEHAVIOUR? Altered mental state is a broad presenting complaint used to describe abnormal consciousness, cognition or behaviour.[1] In the older population, delirium, specifically a fluctuation in orientation and attention in an ill elderly person, is a main consideration. In the slightly younger adult population of less than 65 years of age, altered mentation can vary greatly in presentation, severity and underlying cause. Acute behavioural change is a subset of altered mental state and does not involve diminished consciousness or awareness.[1] There is no fixed definition. Instead, behavioural changes are usually reported deviations from the patient's baseline and behaviour generally accepted as appropriate according to cultural norms. These can be in the form of psychomotor agitation, changes in personality, bizarre actions, heightened or decreased energy and others.[2] Most represent either an organic or psychiatric condition, but all warrant expedient and thorough medical evaluation. There are wide-ranging organic and psychiatric aetiologies causing behavioural changes in adults (Appendix). For the purpose of this article, we will focus on common psychiatric conditions causing altered behaviour. HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? Patients with severe and acute changes in behaviour and mental states present more commonly to the emergency department or psychiatric services than primary care clinics.[2] Primary care physicians may encounter patients with subacute presentations or behaviour that is less disruptive to daily life. There is no data documenting the prevalence of behavioural changes presenting to the primary care clinic. There is, however, high prevalence but underrecognition of mental disorders presenting to primary care,[345] resulting in delayed diagnoses and a significant duration of possible untreated psychiatric disorder.[6] This is juxtaposed to the fact that primary care clinics remain the preferred setting patients with mental disorders first seek help from,[357] making it all the more necessary for family physicians to differentiate psychiatric conditions from organic causes. WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? History and examination As much as possible, corroborative history should be obtained.[8] Physicians often pick up valuable clues from patients' or, in this case, caregivers' observed accounts of the presenting complaint. In an otherwise broad and ill-defined presentation, contextual clues from the caregiver's accounts help to narrow differentials. A reliable third party's observations will also facilitate objective comparison between the patient's baseline and the current pathological behaviour.[9] Helpful questions include the following: What was the behavioural change observed? Was the onset sudden or gradual? Are there intermittent or fluctuating symptoms? Was there a precipitating event? What perpetuates the behaviour and what alleviates it? What has the progress been since? What was the patient's baseline mental state, behaviour, personality, cognition and function like? Severity can be assessed by the degree of disruption to the individual's function, in terms of activities of daily living, occupation and interpersonal relationships. Risk of self-harm and/or harm to others needs to be assessed to decide the need for emergent hospital or psychiatric facility admission. See Box 1 for the suggested criteria for referral to the emergency department.Box 1: Criteria for referral to emergency department.For all patients, a set of vital signs should be recorded and neurological and mental state examinations performed. Where there is suspicion, examination of appropriate systems based on pertinent history should be carried out, for instance, examination for bruising, cataracts, abdominal striae and supraclavicular fat pads for Cushing's syndrome in patients with history of exogenous steroid ingestion (see Appendix for the list of organic causes). Although not diagnostic by individual components and many organic conditions may result in similar mental status presentations, the mental state examination (MSE) offers invaluable clues to diagnosis[210] and completes the evaluation. See Figure 1 for the suggested algorithm for evaluation in a clinic. Primary care physicians ought to be familiar with the components of the MSE. For instance, a blunted affect, evidence of self-neglect, hallucinations or paranoia support diagnosis of psychosis, whether primary or secondary to organic causes.[11] Inattention may be present in substance abuse, mood disorders or schizophrenia. Observations of speech and behaviour are helpful – disorganised speech or paucity of speech occurs in psychotic conditions or depression, word-finding difficulty in dementia and pressured speech in mania or thyrotoxicosis.[10]Figure 1: Suggested algorithm for evaluation in clinic. ANA=anti-nuclear antibody, ED=emergency department, ESR=erythrocyte sedimentation rate, FBC=full blood count, HIV=human immunodeficiency virus, LFT=liver function test, TFT=thyroid function test, UFEME=urine full examination and microscopic examinationApproach Due to time constraints in the clinic setting, a concise and clear approach to evaluating the patient with behavioural changes is necessary. Clinicians may follow the algorithm below to decide on disposition. Patients who are clinically stable with manageable behaviour and who do not urgently require inpatient investigations can continue to be evaluated in the clinic. Basic blood tests ought to be performed before attempting to attribute the behavioural disturbance to psychiatric origins.[5912] Where there is clinical suspicion, tests for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, or antinuclear antibody and erythrocyte sedimentation rate for systemic lupus erythematosus can be performed.[8] WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? One should bear in mind that oftentimes, longitudinal follow-up and observation of the patient's progress over time is necessary for the diagnosis to be reached. Revisitation of the patient's presentation and further corroborative history may be needed to revise diagnoses as patient's symptomology evolves. When diagnoses are not clear-cut or when the initial treatment is ineffective, specialist consult should be sought. Psychiatric differentials See Table 1 for various psychiatric differentials and their featuresTable 1: Psychiatric differential diagnoses to changes in behaviour in adults less than 65 years old.Late-onset schizophrenia Although generally diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood, there is a significant proportion of patients, estimated to be 23.5% from one study,[3] whose symptoms of psychosis only present later in life, after 40 years of age. Patients with late-onset (defined as onset after 40 years of age) or very late-onset (defined as onset after 65 years of age) schizophrenia differ from their younger counterparts in that they have more positive than negative symptoms. Among positive symptoms, the prevalence of complex visual, tactile and olfactory hallucinations, paranoid, persecutory and partition delusions is higher than that of thought disorders and disorganisation.[11] These patients also tend to be female and have better premorbid function and prognosis.[1112] In primary care, there are often a myriad of non-specific prodromal symptoms that result in frequent primary care attendances many years before the diagnosis of psychosis is made, suggesting that there is room for earlier identification of at-risk individuals. These range from a variety of somatic complaints, mood-related symptoms and changes in behaviour, such as impaired personal grooming, social withdrawal and odd behaviour, to the more obvious changes in perception.[6] Psychotic symptoms are commonly associated with depression, anxiety, substance abuse[8] and other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, autoimmune conditions and chronic lung disease.[6] Very late-onset psychosis is further associated with sensory deficits such as vision or conductive hearing loss.[311] These comorbidities ought to be explored and treated where possible. Undiagnosed bipolar disorder Bipolar disorders are frequently missed or misdiagnosed as depression in primary care.[413] Depressive episodes are frequently the first presentation of bipolar disorder, with episodes of extroversion and increased energy unrecognised as manifestations of mania or hypomania. Certain behavioural changes can be subtle, such as frequent changes in jobs, legal trouble in the past or recurrent depression not responding to antidepressants.[13] With increasing prevalence of depression being managed in primary care[4] and the use of antidepressants as monotherapy being contraindicated in mania, every patient suspected to have depression should be screened for bipolar disorder. Frontotemporal dementia Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is another condition underrecognised in primary care, often resulting in significant delays in diagnosis. There are three variants of FTD: behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), semantic dementia and progressive non-affluent aphasia. Although distinct, all three conditions overlap in inappropriate behaviour, emotional blunting, loss of insight and relatively preserved memory and visuospatial ability. Behavioural changes in bvFTD occur insidiously over months with decline in social conduct, apathy, disinhibition and poor impulse control manifesting as unwanted sexual advances, hoarding, roaming and hyperorality.[14] As with other major neurocognitive disorders, there must be a deterioration in baseline function, whether interpersonal, occupational or daily function, for FTD to be diagnosed. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease, anti-cholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated in the treatment of bvFTD due to preserved cholinergic function[1415] and may, in fact, worsen the behaviour. N-methyl-d-aspartic acid antagonists show limited efficacy. Instead, treatment is usually targeted at relief of symptoms and management of behaviour. Take-Home Messages Patients with psychiatric conditions frequently present to primary care, either for prodromal symptoms long before their symptoms manifest or when their behavioural change becomes noticeable by caregivers. A high index of suspicion and thorough evaluation are needed to avoid missing the diagnosis. Corroborative history from a caregiver or family member is crucial in establishing the nature of the complaint, as it provides a reliable picture of the patient's baseline behaviour. Organic conditions, including drug causes, ought to be evaluated first in changes in behaviour before psychiatric diagnoses can be made. These may require extensive organic work-up, for which a referral to the emergency department for admission is indicated. Late-onset schizophrenia is an important diagnosis to consider, especially if there are complex hallucinations, delusions preceded by prodromal symptoms. Concomitant mood disorders, substance abuse, sensory loss and chronic medical conditions ought to be evaluated and treated in patients with possible psychosis. All patients presenting with depression ought to be also evaluated for bipolar disorder to prevent misdiagnosis and wrong treatment. FTD should be considered when there is a decline in cognitive function with apathy, poor impulse control or deterioration in interpersonal relationship. Closing Vignette Due to disruptive behaviour, Mr. Leow was eventually admitted to an acute hospital for work-up. He underwent toxicology studies, further blood tests, a lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. All tests were negative, except for uniform atrophy of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Further cognitive testing showed frontal lobe dysfunction and moderate cognitive impairment. With an impairment in judgement, impulsivity, lack of insight and an absence of hypomania features, Mr. Leow was eventually diagnosed with FTD. He was discharged after all investigations were complete, initiated on a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor and given outpatient specialist follow-up on his behaviour.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "As discussed in Chapter 1, for many young people, exacerbation of manic or depressive symptoms occurs through a spiral of contributing factors, both biological and psychosocial. Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction. Postnatal onset has been more associated with fears of deliberately harming the baby (for example, ‘I could touch my baby inappropriately’), associated with avoidance of …",

      "title": "Episode Depresif Berat dengan Gejala Psikotik (Studi Kasus dalam Perspektif Psikologi dengan Pendekatan Teori Kognitif Beck)",
      "abstract": "Episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik merupakan bentuk dari depresi berat yang disertai gejala psikotik yang khas seperti waham atau delusi non-bizarre nihilistik, somatik, kemiskinan, ketidakberhargaan, atau adanya keyakinan-keyakinan delusional tentang perasaan bersalah dan sedang dihukum, serta kadang-kadang muncul halusinasi. Keyakinan-keyakinan delusional pada penderita episode depresif dengan gejala psikotik merupakan suatu distorsi kognitif, sebuah pola berpikir yang rancu dan menimbulkan kesalahan secara negatif yang meningkatkan kerentanan terhadap depresi. Studi kasus ini mengkaji klien yang didiagnosis episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik dari sudut pandang psikologi dengan pendekatan Teori Kognitif Beck. Seorang laki-laki bernama G, berusia 45 tahun mengurung diri dan tidak mau bertemu dengan saudara-saudaranya. Klien tidak mau mandi serta tidak shalat. Klien merasa ia tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagi. Menurut kakak, adik ipar, dan istri klien, klien pernah mengalami kecelakaan ketika bekerja di pabrik dan saat mengendarai sepeda motor sehingga kondisi fisiknya menurun. Klien lalu mendapatkan pemutusan hubungan kerja. Kondisi kejiwaannya terganggu. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menunjukkan bahwa klien memiliki depresi dan kecemasan berlebihan. Teori kognitif Beck mengenai depresi mencantumkan tiga aktivitas kognitif yang mendasari munculnya sebuah gangguan, yaitu: a) negative triad (pandangan pesimistik terhadap diri sendiri, dunia, dan masa depan); b) skema atau keyakinan negatif yang dipicu oleh peristiwa/ situasi kehidupan negatif; dan c) distorsi kognitif. Negative triad berupa pandangan klien bahwa ia telah gagal, sedang dihukum, dan tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa di masa depan. Skema atau keyakinan negatif klien, yaitu meyakini bahwa karena sakitnya yang dialaminya tersebut membuatnya tidak berdaya. Distorsi Kognitif dalam bentuk overgeneralisasi, yaitu â€œSaya tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagiâ€. Â  Kata Kunci: depresi, gejala psikotik, keyakinan delusional, Teori Kognitif Beck, negative triad Â  Severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a form of major depression accompanied by typical psychotic symptoms such as delusions or nihilistic, non-bizarre delusions, somatic, poverty, worthlessness, or delusional beliefs about guilt and being punished, and sometimes appear hallucination. Delusional beliefs in people with depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a cognitive distortion, a pattern of thinking that is ambiguous and negatively causes errors that increase susceptibility to depression. This case study discusses clients diagnosed with severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms from a psychological perspective with Beckâ€™s Cognitive Theory approach. A 45-year-old man named G locked himself in and didn't want to see his brothers and sisters. Clients did not want to shower and did not pray. The client feels he could not do anything According to the brother, sister-in-law, and client's wife, the client had an accident while working in a factory and while riding a motorcycle so that his physical condition declined. The client then gets terminated in work. His mental condition is disturbed. The results of the integration of psychological tests show that the client has depression and excessive anxiety. Beck's cognitive theory of depression lists three cognitive activities that underlie the emergence of a disorder, namely: a) negative triads (pessimistic views of yourself, the world, and the future); b) negative schemes or beliefs triggered by negative life events/ situations; and c) cognitive distortion. Negative triad is the client's view that he has failed, is being punished, and cannot do anything in the future. The client's negative schema or belief, which is to believe that because of the pain he is experiencing makes him helpless. Cognitive Distortion in the form of overgeneralization, which is I can't do anything else.

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

Objectives A total of 160 patients were examined with delirium alcohol withdrawal. Prognostic factors of occurrence of convulsive syndrome in the withdrawal syndrome of alcohol were studied. Methods Clinical, psychopathological, electrophysiological. Results It was found that the most significant prognostic factors seizures were: severe bloating condition, the duration of hard drinking, the total dose of drinking alcohol before the breakdown of consumption alcohol. Convulsive syndrome not always correlated with marked vegetative disorders in the state of withdrawal of alcohol. Convulsive syndrome that appeared after the development of delirious syndrome often indicated a more serious conditionIt is suggested that the convulsive pattern of response to the severe condition of alcohol withdrawal is formed in some young patients under the influence of endogenous factors, but is realized under certain situational conditions - long binge drinking, massive consumption o alcohol before the break of the reception of alcohol, the use of psychoactive drugs with stimulating effect. In the electrophysiological examination, there were significant differences in the group of patients with convulsive syndrome in the current admission from the group of patients with convulsive syndrome in the past and the group without convulsive syndrome in the state of abolition of alcohol. Conclusions It is emphasized that when indicating the seizures in the state of abolition of alcohol in the past, the beginning of treatment is necessary to begin even in a state of binge drinking.",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

Mistreatment of older people, whether it is abuse or neglect, can be classified as physical, psychologic, or financial/material. Several types of mistreatment may occur simultaneously. Very few data are available in the international literature. It seems that mental abuse and neglect are more frequent, but physical abuse such as beating, pushing, kicking, and possibly sexual abuse have also been reported. Drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults can be difficult to detect (active products at low dosages, chemical instability), can possess amnesic properties, and can be rapidly cleared from the body (short half-life). In these situations, blood, or even urine, can be inadequate. This is the reason why some laboratories have developed an original approach based on hair testing. Hair was suggested as a valuable specimen in situations in which, as a result of a delay in reporting the crime, natural processes have eliminated the drug from typical biologic specimens. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in sexual assault. It should not be considered as an alternative to blood and urine analyses, but as a complement. Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry technologies appear to be required for analyses in drug-facilitated cases. The experience of the authors is presented in cases involving the elderly and chemical poisoning.",

In unusual instances there is difficulty in micturition, slowing of the stream and loss of force. Lowering of the carbon dioxide combining power is not uncommon. With rare exceptions, the drug can be given despite these manifestations. <h3>CYANOSIS</h3> Some degree of cyanosis is present in 90 per cent of the cases in which the drug is used. It varies from a mild bluing of the lips or nail beds to an intense slaty discoloration of the entire body. It usually appears shortly after treatment is started, may disappear during the course of treatment and uniformly disappears within a few days after the use of the drug is stopped.

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ?

      "title": "Schizophrenia in Late Life: Findings Challenge Traditional Concepts",
      "abstract": "Two notions about schizophrenia have persisted: (1) it is characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and (2) it has a progressively deteriorating course. Recent studies focusing on early-adulthood- and middle-age-onset schizophrenia challenge these views. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia and middle-age-onset schizophrenia (MAOS) are similar in terms of family history of schizophrenia, presence of minor physical anomalies, early childhood maladjustment, severity of positive symptoms, presence of gross structural abnormalities on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, overall pattern of neuropsychologic deficits, and qualitative response to neuroleptic medications. Differences include a higher proportion of women among MAOS patients, and the tendency for MAOS patients to have less severe negative symptoms, better neuropsychologic performance (particularly in learning and abstraction/cognitive flexibility), and possibly larger thalamic volume and to respond to lower doses of neuroleptic medications. While onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in very late life may reflect an acquired condition that is not \"true schizophrenia,\" and that may be labeled \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,\" findings suggest that true schizophrenia can arise after early adulthood. Middle-age-onset schizophrenia is predominantly neurodevelopmental, but it is also a distinct neurobiological subtype of schizophrenia. Our studies also demonstrate that neuropsychologic functioning remains stable in chronic schizophrenia outpatients, even when observed over several years and in the presence of significant fluctuations in the severity of clinical symptoms.",

Les effets subjectifs et comportementaux qu’ils induisent sont très impressionnants, et malgré leur toxicité potentielle, le risque d’addiction est relativement faible par rapport à la nicotine, l’alcool ou les opiacés. Depuis la découverte des effets antidépresseurs de la kétamine, il existe un regain d’intérêt pour cette classe de molécules. En effet, la psilocybine et l’acide lysergique diéthylamide (LSD) gagnent de la popularité en tant que traitement pour la dépression et l’addiction, la 3,4-méthylènedioxyméthamphétamine (MDMA) pour l’état de stress post-traumatique, et l’ibogaïne pour l’addiction. Malgré des profils pharmacologiques distincts, ces différentes drogues partagent une cinétique d’action similaire : leurs effets thérapeutiques se font ressentir dans les heures suivant l’administration et perdurent au-delà de leur élimination par l’organisme. Ceci suggère des mécanismes plastiques et neurogéniques impliquant entre autres des facteurs trophiques.

Objectives To describe a case report of a 20-year-old man, in outpatient psychiatric follow-up, after debuting at age 18 with a severe depressive episode of endogenomorphic characteristics without psychotic symptoms, with subsequent complete remission. Two years after clinical stability, he required prolonged hospitalization due to polymorphous psychotic syndrome of abrupt onset in a context of previous continuous use of cannabis and cocaine. Suspicion towards parents, bizarre behaviors, rushing desires, unmotivated laughter, fixed gaze, bewilderment, anguish with a feeling of imminent death, alternates with euphoria and senseless purchases. Methods We present the case report of this patient with a mental examination of conscious, scattered attention with marked distractibility, confusion and experiences of strangeness, memory gaps, subjective sensation of well-being with tachypsychia, which fluctuates with thymic oscillations and alternates with episodes of marked indefinite anguish, intense anxiety with delusional fear of the death of him or his family. Little systematized ideas of reference and prejudice based on intuitions or delusional occurrences in their environment. Megalomaniac and religious-messianic ideation. No sensory perception disturbances. Disintegrated course of thought, with frequent illogical associations, ambivalence of thought, affectivity and psychomotricity. Motor restlessness and behavioral disorganization. Global insomnia. Judgment of reality and superior functions diminished. No auto/heteroaggressiveness. Results Various psychoactive drugs were tested for two months, obtaining a response only with valproic acid 1500mg, pregabalin 450mg and olanzapine 15mg, presenting slow improvement in a situation of absence of consumption, with a predominance of symptomatic polymorphism, decreasing fluctuation between episodes of expansiveness and psychotic anguish, remitting disorganization and motility alterations, persisting poor awareness of the disease and cognitive complaints. He was referred for follow-up at the mental health center where his gradual recovery continued. A differential diagnosis of polymorphous psychosis is proposed, compatible with a cycloid psychosis of the anxiety-happiness type with marked affective symptoms, precipitated by substance use. Conclusions Cycloid anxiety-happiness psychosis stands out for intense and fluctuating anxiety, oscillating with feelings of happiness, ecstasy, and placidity, mystical-religious delusions, and preoccupation with death, which may comprise a different psychotic debut.

      "title": "[Heroin addiction].",
      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

Volume of distribution, half-life, systemic clearance, and receptor sensitivity have been shown to change with increasing age. Unique features of illness in the elderly may interfere with effective drug therapy more than changed pharmacokinetics in some patients. Physical, psychologic, and socioeconomic considerations often interfere with ability to obtain and comply with health care. Disease is often difficult to recognize in elderly patients. Multiple chronic conditions, many of which may be undetected, may be exacerbated by or alter drug therapy for other illnesses. Cognitive impairment and diminished vision and hearing may make patient education difficult, and compliance poor. The elderly are also more susceptible to adverse drug reactions. The recommendations for clinical practice and directions for future research that are presented should help make drug therapy in the elderly safer and more effective.",

Sometimes this can be the effect of a massive personality disorder, which so badly affects nonverbal communication that all speech is made impossible. With other children, this may not be the case, even with those who seem to be taking refuge in prostration, uncontrolled agitation, or weird rituals. When I met Ahlem for the first time, she appeared to be particularly listless, though her psychological difficulties were no more severe than neurosis. Her withdrawal was so profound because it was the result of a confluence of cognitive and aphasiological problems. In fact, she was not completely averse to all contact; once she had gained a little confidence in her own actions, her development toward speech took a normal course. However, as things improved, her difficulties became more pointed, and certain events, which were initially inexplicable, took on a new and remarkable significance.",

The term somnolence describes a drowsy patient who responds to mild stimulus (such as voice), and mumbles incoherently and moves in a disorganized fashion. In contrast, a stuporous patient responds to a vigorous and continuous stimulus only, and upon discontinuation of a stimulus returns to an unresponsive state.

The recent advent of nonabstinent alcoholism treatment programs, in addition to other clinical data, suggests the need for more specific definitions of nonabstinence, attenuated drinking, controlled drinking, and normal thinking.",

En los TP, la farmacoterapia se utiliza para tratar aspectos específicos, como son los síntomas cognitivos perceptuales, afectivos o los derivados de la impulsividad.

Drug use is either a physiological experience or a symptom related to psychopathological condition and other forms of psychic suffering. The most relevant parameters predictive of poor outcome are the precocity of the first experiences, the auto-therapeutic use, the repetition of drug intake, and the various types of individual and social vulnerability. Assimilated to addiction, some inappropriate and compulsive ways to modify body shape (dieting, and anabolic steroid abuse) are seen in teenagers although they are difficult to identify. Prevention and treatment in youths requires a pragmatic attitude from the adults, avoiding minimisation or dramatization of drug use and its consequences. Particular attention has to be paid on the detection of underlying psychiatric disorders. Treatment of problematic drug abuse in adolescents is based on both contextual interventions including systematic support of the families and a multidisciplinary approach.",

      "abstract": "The problem of drug abuse and addiction is one of the most complex problems that affects all countries worldwide, due to the serious damage it can cause to various health, psychological, social, economic and security aspects. All countries strive to fight it by any means necessary. The World Health Organization defines addiction as the compulsive desire to continue using or obtaining a substance by any means, with a tendency to increase the dose taken. This addiction causes psychological and physical dependence and a detrimental effect on both individuals and society. This complicates the treatment project process, especially if the patient/addict suffers from psychological and/or mental disorders associated with addiction. In particular, personality disorders have a direct impact on the behaviors, performance, functions and thinking patterns of the sufferer. As the latter adopts an unhealthy and rigid pattern that causes them and those around them to suffer several psychological, health, social, professional and relational problems... Relatedly, we decided to present a clinical case with a dual diagnosis, as this patient has been suffering from the consequences of addiction for many years accompanied by a personality disorder. As for the clinical symptoms that top the clinical board of the case, we find a complete aversion to his body as he has not looked in the mirror for nearly 30 years. The patient has lost the symbolic representation of his body as a physical reality through which it is located internally, externally and cognitively. This comes in addition to severe clinical suffering at the level of familial, social and professional relationships, which made him live in a state of permanent social isolation. In our therapeutic approach to the condition, we use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a common type of psychotherapy in a regular manner, through a limited number of therapeutic sessions. The therapeutic intervention was carried out at the level of perception of incorrect or negative thinking, which enabled difficult situations to be presented more clearly and responded to in a more effective manner.

The disorder tends to develop before the age of 12. The resulting dysfunction interferes with the quality of social, academic, or workplace functioning, which cannot be explained by other mental disorders or personality disorders. The pathophysiology of ADHD is not well-established. Since ADHD is associated with dopamine and norepinephrine abnormalities, typical treatment strategies include drug therapy (methylphenidate, atomoxetine) combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), parental training, and other treatments. Predominant drug therapies may lead to adverse reactions such as digestive problems and growth restriction and do not produce a response in some cases. As a result, physical therapy is considered as an alternative option.",

The death, injury and property damage on the highway in which driver or victim was significantly and relevantly affected by alcohol form the first level problem; the legislation, education, law enforcement, public opinion programs and other means for controlling such alcohol-affected traffic damage as they are believed to be ineffective or “bad” form the second level. Attempts even to describe the first level may be nullified by conflict, misinformation, ignorance and emotionality related to the second level. Common interpretations of drinking, driving and accident, the tendency to view drinking-and-driving as a unitary phenomenon, the popular attribution of rarity, evil and irrationality to the behavior, the widespread use of single-cause explanations for highly complicated events, all suggest the need to describe the second-level problems before defining the events themselves. Major difficulties in gaining information for adequate understanding of first-level problems are described. Recent social changes suggest that these difficulties are currently more susceptible to effective attack.",

      "title": "BRUXISMO DO SONO",
      "abstract": "Introducao: O bruxismo do sono e caracterizado pelo ranger ou apertar dos dentes durante o sono e que, geralmente, esta associada com despertares curtos com duracao de 3 a 15 segundos, conhecidos como microdespertares e se diferencia do bruxismo diurno por envolver: distintos estados de consciencia, isto e, sono e vigilia; e diferentes estados fisiologicos com diferentes influencias na excitabilidade oral motora. O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

It is unclear whether children that develop the syndrome had entirely normal cognitive skills before seizure onset, since subtle impairment easily escapes recognition in small infants. It is also difficult to demonstrate whether a recognisable profile of cognitive impairment or a definite behavioural phenotype exists. No clear‐cut imaging or neuropathological marker or substrate has been recognised for cognitive impairment in this syndrome. However, there are different potentially causative factors, including the specific effects on the Nav1.1 channels caused by the underlying genic or genomic defect; frequent and prolonged convulsive and non‐convulsive seizures or status epilepticus; recurrent subtle ictal phenomena, such as that accompanying pronounced visual sensitivity; the use of antiepileptic drugs with cognitive side effects, especially in heavy multiple‐drug therapy; and the restrictions that children with severe epilepsy inevitably undergo.",

      "title": "Awareness Under General Anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Background: Awareness while under general anesthesia, and the later recall of what happened during surgery, can be experienced by patients as horrific events that leave lasting mental trauma behind.Patients may have both auditory and tactile perception, potentially accompanied by feelings of helplessness, inability to move, pain, and panic ranging to an acute fear of death.For some patients, the experience of awareness under anesthesia has no sequelae; for others, however, it can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, consisting of complex psychopathological phenomena such as anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, irritability, and depression possibly leading to suicidality.Methods: The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed.Results: In the absence of risk factors awareness phenomena occur in one to two per 1000 operations under general anesthesia (0.1% to 0.2%) and are thus classed as an occasionally occurring critical event.In children, the risk of such phenomena occurring is 8 to 10 times higher.These phenomena are due to an inadequate depth of anesthesia with incomplete unconsciousness.They can be promoted by a number of risk factors that are either patient-related (ASA class III or above, medication abuse), surgery-related (Caesarean section, emergency procedures, surgery at night), or anesthesia-related (anesthesia without benzodiazepines, use of muscle relaxants).Conclusion: Strategies for avoiding awareness phenomena under anesthesia include the training of staff to know about the problem and, specifically, the use of benzodiazepines, the avoidance of muscle relaxants if possible, and shielding the patient from excessive noise.EEG monitoring is effective but provides no guarantee against awareness.If awareness under anesthesia occurs despite these measures, the patient must be given expert, interdisciplinary treatment as soon after the event as possible in order to minimize its potential sequelae.",

      "title": "Dysphasia after stroke and legal capacity",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Although after stroke dysphasia or aphasia is not equal to incapacity, the legal capacity of patients can be doubted. The patients’ ability to fully comprehend the given information and make decisions may be impaired. Stroke is sudden, life threatening and likely to affect capacity even in the absence of dysphasia. There are currently no published guidelines in the management of legal issues for patients and professionals. Method A literature review in the Pubmed database has been made, using the key‐words: stroke, legal capacity, decision‐making Result Brain injury after stroke may impair appreciation of decisions’ consequences and/or communicating decisions effectively, while the capacity to reason remains. Stroke may affect various brain areas, i.e. prefrontal cortex involved in decision‐making (ventromedial prefrontal cortex damage may lead to impulsive decision‐making). A right‐brain stroke may cause poor executive function, lack of initiation or neglect. Left‐hemisphere strokes may lead to aphasia and reduced capacity evaluation. The dysphasic may understand more than he can express, or vice versa. Difficulties further compounding communication problems include: reading and writing; numeracy; inattention/concentration; fatigue; emotional control (lability); perseveration; intellectual functioning. Receptive aphasia can impair understanding medical options, while expressive aphasia may prevent communicating relative decisions. Patients may also be susceptible to undue influence regarding testamentary and financial capacity due to communication deficits and varying levels of dependence. Depression following stroke can further impair capacity. Conclusion The patient may have a communication rather than a capacity deficit. Judging a patient’s ability to weigh information is often the most difficult aspect of legal capacity assessment. There is little literature or high court jurisdiction regarding whether dysphasia after stroke impairs patients’ capacity. Evaluation of the prerequisites for legal capacity requires a multi‐professional cooperation.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty of assessing the effects of mind- altering drugs on human behavior, especially conduct in real-life situations, is discussed. Problems in classification of drugs are also noted; it is emphasized that assumed drug effects are, at best, statements of probability. In considering crimes associated with drug use, it is necessary to distinguish between crimes based on drug use itself, which include all offenses for illicit acquisition, possession, and use of dangerous drugs and narcotics, and dangerous behavior resulting from use. The evidence is clearest for alcohol, revealing a distinct relationship between alcohol use and health hazard, suicide, accidents, and violence. The evidence is less clear for heroin, since most users are delinquent prior to being identified as \"addicts\" so that continued criminality after heroin use cannot be \"caused\" by narcotics. That the kind of criminality engaged in is influenced by drug use does seem a reasonable conclusion. Evidence about the degree of risk for the use of other drugs (sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, volatile intoxicants, and the like) and crime is absent. Generally, it appears that most Americans use drugs without major ill- effects—including occasional illicit use. Those likely to be engaged in drug use and in crime are likely to be urban slum- dwelling males, with an overrepresentation of minority groups. Such behavior is apt to be part of a life pattern of deficit and disorder.",

      "abstract": "Fatty acids are a major fuel for the body and fatty acid oxidation is particularly important during fasting, sustained aerobic exercise & stress. The myocardium and resting skeletal muscle utilise long-chain fatty acids as a major source of energy. Inherited disorders of fatty acid oxidation seriously compromise the function of muscle and other highly energy-dependent tissues such as brain, nerve, heart, kidney & liver. Defects of fatty acid oxidation lead to a range of neuromyopathic disease in both adults and children. Such defects encompass a wide spectrum of clinical disease, presenting in the neonatal period or infancy with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, liver dysfunction and hyperammonaemia with neurosensory deficits secondary to the acute onset. In addition, there may be cardiac arrhythmias and/or progressive cardiomyopathy, which may give rise to secondary hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. In older children, adolescence or adults there is often exercise intolerance with episodic myalgia or rhabdomyolysis in association with prolonged aerobic exercise or other exacerbating factors. Some disorders are particularly associated with toxic metabolites that may contribute to encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, axonopathy and pigmentary retinopathy. Diagnosis is through clinical suspicion with appropriate investigations in blood and urine taken during crisis. Definitive diagnosis is usually by fibroblast assay. Treatment is generally through avoidance of fasting, frequent carbohydrate rich feeds and in long-chain defects MCT supplementation. Novel treatments include the use of D,L-3-hydroxybutyrate and the potential use of fibrates to increase mutant protein levels in mild disorders.",

Although there are non-pathological manifestations of dissociation, this chapter covers measures for the detection of pathological dissociation and for the diagnosis of the DSM-IV dissociative disorders (dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified). The instruments included in this section evaluate clinical and non-clinical dissociation (e.g., the Dissociative Experiences Scale [DES]) and help diagnose dissociative disorders according to DSM-IV criteria (e.g., the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule [DDIS]).

Uma disfuncao invisivel e que passa despercebida para o paciente e, por vezes, para os profissionais que o acompanham, e a perda da sensibilidade. A referida perda tem consequencias no desempenho motor pois sem o feed-back sensorial torna-se dificil realizar movimentos delicados ou coordenados. E a disfuncao sensorial pode agravar os problemas de negligencia do lado afetado, uma vez que o paciente nao sente o lado acometido, “abandonando” o uso da mao comprometida. Uma das grandes dificuldades da familia e cuidadores e com relacao as disfuncoes apresentadas pelo paciente e como realizar as atividades para que o mesmo alcance independencia nas tarefas cotidianas. As orientacoes dadas pela Terapia Ocupacional no momento da alta hospitalar quanto as atividades da vida diaria, para recuperacao sensorial e adequacao das atividades em geral, sao bem recebidas pelos familiares. Um acompanhamento sistematico, com novas orientacoes e demonstracoes e de grande valia para reduzir as dificuldades para desempenho das atividades da vida diaria por parte dos pacientes e para minimizar as demandas junto aos cuidadores. Os beneficiarios diretos sao os familiares e mais especificamente os cuidadores dos pacientes que, em geral, sao as esposas/companheiras dos pacientes que ja tem tarefas de cuidados domesticos. Foram beneficiados aproximadamente 30 pessoas e a reducao das demandas por parte dos pacientes foi crucial para qualidade de vida.",

Personality patterns are termed traits because they are longstanding and consistent, just like other traits such as eye color, hair texture, and height. State behavior refers to behaviors that come and go, such as a mood state and many DSM axis I conditions. Abnormal behavioral states are assumed to represent illness and underlying brain dysfunction or disease. Abnormal behavioral traits are assumed not to reflect brain dysfunction or disease, but rather a deviance that has developed during a person’s formative years.",

Frequently observed toxic symptoms are sinus tachycardia and altered mental status. Severe toxic symptoms include altered mental status, dysrhythmia, seizure, and secondary complications. Serious cardiotoxicity can lead to ventricular dysrhythmia and a classic TCA electrocardiogram. Gluteal myonecrosis is reported in postoperative alcoholic states, unconscious conditions where patients remain in one position over a long period of time, strenuous physical training, or in crushing injuries. We report a case of gluteal myonecrosis after treatment with several drugs including TCA resulted in intoxication. The patient was mentally drowsy and had been lying down for 20 hours upon discovery. The patient presented on arrival to the ER with cardiotoxicity secondary to TCA intoxication and was treated. Two weeks following the incident, she complained of pain in the gluteal area. Subsequent management and investigation revealed that her gluteal myonecrosis was a result of delayed complication from a prolonged recumbent position and hemolysis due to drug interactions. She eventually recovered without the need for surgery (fasciotomy).",

      "title": "Apathy, Anhedonia and Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Motivation – the capacity to experience enthusiasm for achieving a goal, which helps to initiate, guide and maintain behaviour – is a fundamental psychological process that serves to enable both survival and thriving in the face of challenge. Loss of motivation can have a debilitating impact on everyday function, resulting in difficulty working, studying and taking care of responsibilities at home; and, in extreme cases, a total loss of motivation results in the absence of any behaviour at all. Disrupted motivation can be expressed through a variety of clinical symptoms, including apathy, anhedonia and fatigue, which tend to cluster together. These motivational symptoms are very common, occurring across a broad range of neuropsychiatric conditions, for example depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, but as yet we have no specific treatments for them. This chapter provides an introduction into research into the neuroscientific and psychological mechanisms underlying motivation, which has yielded important information regarding the key brain circuity and cognitive operations involved. There are several key messages. (i) Motivation is a multifactorial construct, comprising several distinct cognitive operations, and dysfunction in any one of these has the potential to result in motivational symptoms.",

It may be caused by several different diseases, the most common being Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia. There are other potentially treatable causes, including depression, which must be excluded. Drug treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors may reduce the progression of dementia for a period, especially in Alzheimer’s disease. Antipsychotic drugs should be used with great care. The associated impairment and behavioural problems often requires social care, sometimes in institutions, and will place an increasing burden on medical services and society.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a range of psychomotor abnormalities. It was first described in 1875 by Kahlbaum (1) who reported 25 patients with a \"brain disease\" characterized by four of the following signs: long periods of immobility, mutism alternating with verbigeration, staring, withdrawal and refusal to eat or drink, negativism, posturing and grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, stereotypy, and waxy flexibility (see Table 1). Kahlbaum observed that these otherwise immobile patients could become very agitated or excited and were often found to have extremes of mood disturbance in the form of \"melancholy\" or \"mania.\" This phenomenon of marked, polar alterations in the predominant psychomotor state eventually led to division of the syndrome into retarded and excited types (2). The excited form has been much more difficult to characterize and distinguish from mania (3). In rare instances, patients with severe motor excitement develop fever, autonomic disturbances, stupor, and rhabdomyolysis and may succumb to cardiovascular collapse. This clinical state has been referred to as lethal or malignant catatonia (4,5) and the clinical and laboratory similarities to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has generated considerable interest and discussion (6,7).",

Causal pathologies are either cerebral or general. The most common is the stroke, especially if it is haemorrhagic. If the seizure is delayed in relation to stroke, it defines vascular epilepsy and is an indication for long-term antiepileptic therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases, primarily Alzheimer's disease, are associated with epilepsy, but the pathophysiological links between the two are poorly understood. The clinical presentation of seizures is often atypical and the existence of memory disorders complicates the diagnosis because they make it difficult to reconstruct the anamnesis. Cranial trauma and tumours are the other classic brain causes of epilepsy. The general causes include metabolic and hydroelectrolytic disorders (especially hypoglycaemia and hyponatremia), drugs (either by their toxicity or by a withdrawal syndrome), and uraemic encephalopathy of renal failure. Finally, alcohol is a common cause not to be neglected, including among institutionalised patients.",

It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

      "title": "Psychoactive Drug Misuse in Long-Term Care: Some Contributing Factors",
      "abstract": "Surveys have identified inappropriate psychoactive drug prescribing patterns as a major problem in the care of nursing home residents. Residents without a documented history of mental illness often receive drugs intended to treat psychiatric problems. One of the greatest areas of misuse of these drugs is in the treatment of agitation in elderly demented residents. For example, although this purpose is likely the most common reason antipsychotic drugs are used in the nursing home setting, no well designed study has yet demonstrated that these agents are effective for this problem. Elderly individuals are particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of psychoactive drugs. Due to the gradual or insidious onset of some adverse effects, psychoactive drug toxicity may often be underestimated. The most serious example of a clinically underrecognized adverse effect of psychoactive drugs is tardive dyskinesia. Misinterpretation of certain nursing home residents' behaviors may lead to medication with tranquilizing drugs when other approaches may be safer and more effective. Excessive use of psychoactive drugs is not only physically harmful, but also encourages an apathetic attitude toward implementation of more humane ways of dealing with behaviorally disturbed nursing home residents.",

Forms of conduct once simply regarded as part of the human condition, are rapidly being reinterpreted as types of mental illness. Individuals are no longer simply quiet or shy, they are reclassified as suffering from Generalised Social Phobia, or Selective Mutism, or Avoidant Personality Disorder. Others are no longer simply unpopular or obnoxious, they are reclassified as Borderline Personality Disorder, or Antisocial Personality Disorder. Still more are no longer lively or boisterous, they have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or Conduct Disorder, or Oppositional Defiance Disorder.",

      "abstract": "Palinacousis or auditory perseveration is a form of acquired auditory perceptual disorder that occurs rarely due to an acute intracranial process. The condition mimics psychotic hallucination, seizure, or other behavioral disorders, potentially causing management delay. We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage.A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial imaging revealed right parietal intracranial hemorrhage likely secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertension. Extensive workup and thorough clinical examination ruled out dementia, psychosis, seizure, or other behavioral disorders. The condition gradually improved without any specific intervention.Abnormality in auditory processing due to intracranial lesions affecting auditory cortical projections causes a variety of symptoms that mimic other conditions such as psychotic hallucinations, and ictal and postictal behavioral changes. Thorough characterization with detailed examination and workup may help in distinguishing one from the other. A rare form of palinacousis may occur after unilateral nondominant parietal lesion. The condition is self-limiting and requires no specific management. Ruling out seizure disorder or psychiatric condition may prevent unnecessary workup and treatment.",

      "title": "Neuroradiological manifestations of drug use: description of clinical cases",
      "abstract": "Introduction Drug use and misuse continue to create public health challenges in the world, leading to overdose deaths, infections, and other chronic health conditions. Illegal addictive drugs can lead to functional or structural impairment of the central nervous system (CNS). Because clinical findings alone are often nonspecific, and some patients are unlikely to admit substance abuse, the neuroimaging may play an important role in establishing the diagnosis and initiating treatment. Objectives We aim to provide an overview of the structural imaging findings on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging related to chronic and acute abuse of commonly addictive substances, including cannabis, alcohol, cocaine, and opioids. Methods Non systematic review of the literature on the subject and description of three clinical cases. Results Pathomecanisms of drugs misuse include excitotoxicity, which may lead to an acute or subacute leukoencephalopathy, and vascular complications, including vasoconstriction, vasculitis, or hypertension, which may lead to intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia. Alcohol abuse may lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, revealing in MR bilateral symmetrical hyperintense signals on T2-weighted; Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a very rare condition which may present hypodense lesions in the corpus callosum; and alcoholic cerebellar degeneration is a common type of acquired cerebellar ataxia and may present cerebellar volume loss localized to the anterior superior vermis. One of our clinical cases is a female, 39 years, and present cocaine induced multifocal leukoencephalopathy, associated with inflammatory/immune mediated mechanism. Other clinical case (female, 24 years) demonstrate spongiform leukoencephalotpathy from “chasing” heroin, with a characteristic presentation. Conclusions The main pathomechanisms related to the abuse of drugs are ischemia, hemorrhage, and leukoencephalopathy related to excitotoxicity of the drug or its derivatives. Clinical findings are nonspecific, highlighting the need to recognize these complications at both CT and MR imaging. Therefore, diagnostic imaging modalities can play a pivotal role in the recognition and timely management of drug-related complications in the CNS. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Many concussion patients who complain about problems with memory actually have an attention deficit. General measures: treat insomnia, stop alcohol, prescribe moderate cardiovascular exercise, and refer for cognitive rehabilitation (occupational and speech therapy). Consider treatment with a stimulant such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), amphetamine mixed salts (Adderall), and atomoxetine (Strattera), if appropriate, with careful monitoring for side effects. Contraindications include uncontrolled seizures, dangerous anxiety, active cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, active psychosis, drug abuse, irresponsible criminal behavior, dangerously underweight, and uncontrolled headaches. Recommend use is 6 days per week 51 weeks per year to reduce tolerance. Some patients find additional benefit from donepezil, rivastigmine, and regulated caffeine use. Approach options: “aggressive,” involving treatment with stimulants primarily based on history; “moderate,” involving treatment with stimulants only in patients with attention performance impairments documented with neuropsychological evaluation; and “conservative,” not including stimulants unless there is a well-documented history of preinjury attention deficit disorder.",

This process likely contributes to increased risk taking and lapses in sound decision making but also supports learning and being open to new experiences. A growing research base points to the view that drug use is a harmful activity for youth and that early-onset and frequent use of drugs may disrupt brain development. The “brain under construction” of a teenager is vulnerable to the effects of stress, and in combination with biological risk, adolescence is a period of onset of many mental illnesses. Several cognitive deficits have been linked to early use of alcohol or cannabis; the earlier age of onset of regular use, the worse the neurocognitive outcomes. Also, the risk for addiction for all licit and illicit drugs is greatly increased when a person starts to use a drug during their teen years.",

Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome. One umbrella category for neurologically related somatic symptoms, functional neurological disorder (FND), presents as involuntary neurological symptoms incompatible with another medical condition. Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. Being mindful of these challenges when treating patients presenting with functional symptoms in acute care settings can help to support and protect the patients and care team and appropriately control healthcare costs.",

      "abstract": "Subtle alterations in brain development caused by genes or early environmental hazards, such as obstetric complications, play a role in projecting some individuals on a trajectory toward schizophrenia. High-risk and cohort studies demonstrate that children destined to develop schizophrenia tend to have delayed milestones and subtle neuromotor and cognitive impairments (particularly in coordination and language). These neurocognitive problems lead to difficulties in interpersonal relations, and their progressive alienation makes these at-risk children more likely to harbor odd or paranoid ideas. This cascade of increasingly deviant development may then be compounded by brain maturational changes during adolescence with a resultant lability of the dopaminergic response to stress. As a result, the individual is more susceptible to the effects of the abuse of dopamine-releasing drugs, and to other risk factors such as migration or stressful life events; social isolation may be a common pathway underlying several of the social risk factors.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "A complaint of bloating or swelling of sufficient severity to lead to medical consultation is the lead symptom of a syndrome (the fluid retention syndrome) which includes affective, somatic and autonomic symptoms. These appear to have a primary origin in a neuroendocrine disturbance of limbic and hypothalamic function and form a substantial part of the work-load of a menopause clinic. The fluid retention syndrome, in turn, is one component of a spectrum of affective-somatic-autonomic disorders which comprise a significant part of the general practitioner's work load. Major risk factors for the fluid retention syndrome comprise a strong family history of swelling symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, affective illness, including major life events, weight gain and obesity. Short term exacerbations of swelling are precipitated by emotional stress, high carbohydrate meals, alcohol, prolonged standing and exercise, high ambient temperatures and rebound oedema following the withdrawal of diuretic therapy. Management involves recognition of the syndrome, a clear explanation of its nature to the patient, the control of weight-related fluid retention by reduction to a pre-morbid target weight and the avoidance of inappropriate drug therapy. In particular, diuretics should not be prescribed for fluid-retaining symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be prescribed for patients with the fluid retention syndrome if there is biochemical evidence of ovarian failure. The role of HRT in inducing rapid bloating independently of weight gain requires evaluation by a randomised controlled clinical trial. More effective management of the syndrome awaits further understanding of the neuroendocrine substrate for the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The syndromes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MiND), often prodromal to dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder), are characterized by acquired clinically significant changes in one or more cognitive domains despite preserved independence. Mild impairment has significant medicolegal consequences for an affected person and their care system. We review the more common etiologies of MiND and provide a systematic review of its medicolegal implications. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed English literature on medicolegal aspects of MCI or MiND using comprehensive search terms and expanding our review to include sources cited by these reports. Results: Impairment of memory, executive function, social cognition, judgment, insight or abstraction can alter an individual’s abilities in a variety of areas that include decision making, informed consent, designation of a surrogate decision-maker such as a health care proxy, understanding and management of financial affairs, execution of a will, or safe driving. Conclusion: Even mild cognitive impairment can have significant behavioral consequences. Clinicians can assist care partners and persons with MCI or MiND by alerting them to the medicolegal concerns that often accompany cognitive decline. Early recognition and discussion can help a care system manage medicolegal risk more effectively and promote thoughtful advance planning.",

      "title": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: how to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat it.",
      "abstract": "(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D.

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar]. Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness. Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation. The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicide Differential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made. Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar]. Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M.

      "title": "The Acute Encephalopathy of Kwashiorkor",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Children with kwashiorkor often become drowsy after a few days' treatment. This usually passes off, but may deepen into coma with eventual death. This encephalopathy is not due to severe brain disruption, infection, drug toxicity, hypoglycaemia, uraemia or cholaemia. It is associated with an anomalously high hydroxyproline index and a low serum sodium during treatment. No firm conclusions can be made concerning its aetiology, but movements of water and electrolytes across the blood‐brain barrier may play an important role. The effect of standardised stimuli, such as loads of sodium, water or protein, or rapidly acting diuretics on the children's eeg might be of value. RÉSUMÉ Les enfants atteints de kwashiorkor deviennent souvent somnolents après quelques jours de traitement. Le trouble disparait habituellement, mais peut parfois s'aggraver jusqu'au coma et même éventuellement la mort. Cette encéphalopathie n'est pas dûe à une lésion grave du cerveau, à une infection, à un effet toxique de médicament, à une hypoglycémie, urémie ou cholémie. Elle est associée à un index d'hydroxyproline anormalement élevé et à un taux de sodium sérique bas durant le traitement. Il est impossible de tirer des conclusions fermes quant à l'étiologie, mais les mouvements de l'eau et des électrolytes à travers la barrière hémo‐cérébrale pourraient jouer un rôle important. L'effet sur l' eeg de ces enfants d'épreuves standardisées, telles qu'épreuves de charges en sodium, en eau ou en protéine, ou encore l'usage de diurétiques à action rapide pourraient avoir de la valeur. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG An Kwashiorkor leidende Kinder werden oft einige Tage nach Einsetzen der Behandlung schläfrig. In den meisten Fällen sind diese Bewußtseinsänderungen reversible, doch kann sich der Zustand bis zura tödlichen Coma verschlechtern. Diese Encephalopathie wird nicht durch schwere anatomische Hirnveränderungen, durch Infektion, Arzneimittel, Hypoglykämie, Urämie orde Cholämie verursacht. Die Schläfrigkeit tritt in Verbindung mit einem erhöhten Hydroxyprolin‐Index und einem niedrigen Serum‐Natriumgehalt während der Behandlung auf. Es gibt bisher keine sicheren Hinweise für die Ätiologie, es ist aber möglich, daß Verteilungsstörungen von Wasser und Electrolyten an der Bluthirnschranke eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Dosierte Reizeffekte auf das Electroencephalogramm sowie Belastungen mit Natrium, Wasser oder Protein sowie schnellwirksame Diuretika könnten eventuell einen positiven Effekt haben. RESUMEN Niftos afectos de kwashiorkor se ponen muchas veces soñolientos después de algunos días de tratamiento. Generalmente se recuperan de este estado, pero a veces caen en un coma y por fin fallecen. Esta encefalopatía no es debida a disrupción grave del cerebro, infección, toxicidad de drogas, hipoglucemia, uremia, ni colemia. Es asociada a un índice exageradamente elevado de hidroxiprolina y a valores bajos de sodio en el suero durante el tratamiento. No es posible hacer conclusiones firmes sobre su etiología, pero movimientos de agua y de electrolitos a través de la barrera sangre‐cerebro pueden ser importantes.

      "abstract": "Durante el siglo XX se ha producido un cambio relacionado con las conductas adictivas. Nos referimos al impacto que han ocasionado las llamadas adicciones no quimicas o sin sustancia, tambien denominadas adicciones psicologicas. Estos procesos hacen alusion a la presentacion de comportamientos de tipo dependiente, y que van siendo reconocidos, poco a poco, en el ambito cientifico- sanitario. Prueba de ello es el debate que actualmente se libera en el seno del APA y del DSM-V, de proxima publicacion. Por tanto, se hace necesario identificar los patrones de uso de estas conductas, los factores de vulnerabilidad para la realizacion de las mismas, de modo abusivo o adictivo, asi como las diferentes formas de abordar terapeuticamente estos nuevos problemas, sin olvidar las estrategias de prevencion mas eficaces. Comportamientos tan sencillos y habituales como hablar por el movil, salir de compras o hacer ejercicio, por ejemplo, pueden convertirse en verdaderas adicciones para algunos, teniendo en cuenta, ademas, que su prevalencia es cada vez mayor y continua actualmente en aumento, siendo necesaria la busqueda de tratamientos eficaces para estas nuevas patologias psicologicas. Pretendemos llamar la atencion acerca de la posibilidad de que estas conductas, con frecuencia normales, puedan convertirse en patologicas en razon de la intensidad, frecuencia o cantidad de tiempo/dinero invertido, y en funcion del grado de interferencia en las relaciones familiares, sociales y laborales que afectan y dan la calidad moral da la persona que las sufre. Desde la perspectiva psicosomatica, con el apoyo del paradigma Bio - psico – socio - eco –espiritual, se consigue, sin duda, una mejor comprension y un abordaje mas eficaz de todos estos cuadros psicopatologicos.",

The drug related factors are either the intrinsic epileptogenicity of the specific agent or patient related factors such as convulsive predisposition, underlying neurologic dysfunction, and factors which affect the serum concentration and/or central neurologic system concentrations. Some anti epileptic drugs may aggravate an epileptic syndrome. In 10-15% of patients with epilepsy, better control of seizures can be achieved with combination therapy. These patients are at greater risk of suffering clinically serious interactions. Drug interactions occur at the pharmacokinetic level and at the pharmacodynamic level, involving synergistic or antagonistic effects. Finally many drugs can interfere with the antiepileptic drug metabolism. The inverse effect is also frequent. A better knowledge of the spectrum of drugs that cause seizures or interfere with antiepileptic drugs metabolism is important for evaluation of appropriate treatment options and for guiding the choice of rational therapeutic procedures.",

Older people show more somatic or cognitive complaints compared to younger depressives. Risk factors for depression in old age are (incident) physical disorders, sleep disorders or loss of spouse. Depression worsens course and prognosis of comorbid somatic disorders. A major consequence is the high suicide rate in the elderly. Depression is also a risk factor for other disorders like dementia or institutionalisation. The interplay between depression and dementia and other organic brain disorders is complex und still unresolved. Depression in the elderly is a challenge for our health system. Recognition and treatment rates are still too low. Integrative treatment plans for depression with comorbid physical disorders or in various settings should be developed. With the growing elderly population the available evidence for treatment urgently has to be increased. In current practice drug therapies--mostly inadequate--dominate. Psychotherapy should be promoted and the number of old age psychotherapists increased.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

For example, regulatory changes affecting the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems may have broad impact on adaptation to orthostatic stress. Common clinical manifestations of autonomic dysfunction in elderly patients include orthostatic hypotension (OH), postprandial hypotension, hypothermia, and heat stroke. These are rarely problematic in healthy elderly individuals under the usual demands of life, but may become clinically significant during exposure to a variety of external influences, such as medications, changes in fluid intake, or relatively hot or cold environmental temperatures. Other geriatric problems such as constipation, urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction may mimic autonomic insufficiency, but are usually caused by conditions outside of the autonomic nervous system. For example, sexual dysfunction in old age is more likely due to vascular disease, diabetes, depression, or medications, than it is to age-associated autonomic dysfunction....",

In this study, 50 violent offenders were interviewed with neuropsychological and psychometric measures, to determine the factors that underlie amnesia and the recovery of memory in these cases. The results showed that amnesia for a violent offense was associated with crimes of passion and dissociative symptoms at the time, but not with impaired neuropsychological functioning. Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

In some cases, the syndromes of depression and cognitive impairment may be related to the same underlying disorder (eg, vascular dementia, hypothyroidism), whereas in other cases, they may be relatively independent and simply coexist. Cognitive deficits in late-life depression span multiple domains; however, deficits in executive functions may be particularly important as their presence predicts poor clinical outcomes. Cognitive impairment, when mild, does not appear to progress to dementia in most cases, but variability in the course of elders with depression and cognitive impairment suggests the need for careful follow-up, particularly in cases where executive dysfunction is suspected. The Expert Consensus Guideline recommends antidepressant drug therapy combined with a psychosocial intervention as the treatment of choice for geriatric depression. New treatments including computerized cognitive remediation and problem-solving therapy may be particularly effective in treating both affective and cognitive symptoms.",

      "title": "Deterioro cognitivo leve y reserva cognitiva en una muestra representativa de la población española",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION: El envejecimiento de la poblacion constituye uno de los mayores desafios sociales de nuestro siglo. El impacto del envejecimiento de la poblacion se vera amplificado por un destacado aumento en la prevalencia de los trastornos neurodegenerativos y, muy particularmente, la demencia. La deteccion precoz de la demencia debe constituir una prioridad de la salud publica, no solo por su alta prevalencia, sino por su correlacion con alteraciones funcionales graves, necesidades de atencion a largo plazo, e importantes costos para la sociedad. Esto es especialmente relevante dados los muy limitados exitos terapeuticos actuales en el tratamiento de la demencia, que parecen indicar que el tiempo en que se suele realizar el diagnostico puede ser demasiado tardio para que las estrategias terapeuticas puedan ser efectivas. Es en este escenario donde surgio el termino deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL), entendido como un estado intermedio entre el envejecimiento normal y la demencia, que implica una alteracion de una o varias areas cognitivas que no es esperable para la edad del sujeto ni tampoco cumple los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia. Por otro lado, si bien la esperanza de vida de las personas se ha incrementado considerablemente en las ultimas decadas, se desconoce si estos anos de vida adicionales son vividos en un buen estado de salud y bienestar. Por esta razon, los investigadores han puesto el foco de estudio en las trayectorias y variables que promuevan un envejecimiento activo, y permitan maximizar la capacidad funcional y mantener la calidad de vida en esos anos adicionales. Diversos factores se han asociado a calidad de vida previamente, sin embargo, existen muy pocos estudios que hayan analizado si una mayor reserva cognitiva (RC) conduce a una mejor calidad de vida en personas con edades medias y avanzadas. El hecho de que factores potencialmente modificables a lo largo de la vida como la educacion, la ocupacion y el ocio protejan frente al deterioro cognitivo y funcional, plantearia la posibilidad de que la RC pueda aumentar indirectamente la calidad de vida de un individuo al permitir compensar un determinado deterioro o dano cerebral. OBJETIVOS: Los objetivos de la presente tesis se desglosan de la siguiente forma: a) Estimar la prevalencia de DCL en la poblacion espanola de 50 anos o mas segun el sexo, el grupo de edad (50-64 anos vs 65 o mas anos) y el subtipo de DCL; b) Examinar, de forma transversal, factores psicologicos, cardiovasculares y de estilos de vida asociados a DCL, analizando posibles diferencias en funcion del grupo de edad (50-64 anos vs 65 o mas anos); c) Estimar la tasa de incidencia de DCL en la poblacion espanola mayor de 50 anos segun el sexo, el grupo de edad (50-64 anos vs 65 o mas anos) y el subtipo de DCL, d) Determinar el efecto longitudinal de la depresion sobre el desarrollo de DCL tras un seguimiento a 3 anos, analizando posibles diferencias en funcion del subtipo de DCL; e) Examinar la asociacion entre RC y calidad de vida en la poblacion espanola mayor de 50 anos, analizando posibles diferencias en funcion del grupo de edad (50-64 anos vs 65 o mas anos); f) Explorar si la posible asociacion entre RC y calidad de vida esta mediada por el efecto del funcionamiento cognitivo, el nivel de discapacidad o la presencia de depresion. METODOS: Los datos provienen de los participantes del estudio COURAGE, un estudio longitudinal que ha recogido los determinantes mas importantes del envejecimiento en una muestra nacionalmente representativa de la poblacion adulta espanola. La muestra original esta compuesta por 4753 sujetos mayores de 18 anos, si bien los analisis realizados en la presente tesis se centran en aquellos de 50 o mas anos, y la n final depende de cada objetivo particular. El protocolo desarrollado recoge informacion sobre enfermedades cronicas, salud mental, calidad de vida, bienestar y medidas objetivas de la salud (incluyendo la funcion cognitiva), y determinantes de la salud (consumo de sustancias, actividad fisica, redes sociales, etc.). La muestra fue entrevistada por primera vez en 2011-2012 y posteriormente en 2014-2015. RESULTADOS Y CONCLUSIONES: 1. La prevalencia de DCL es de 9.6% en la poblacion espanola de mediana y avanzada edad, con tasas mas elevadas en edad avanzada y mujeres. La tasa incidencia de DCL es de 33.19 por 1000 personas-ano, con cifras mas altas en edad avanzada y mujeres. 2. La depresion, la diabetes, un bajo nivel de actividad fisica y alteraciones del sueno se relacionan significativamente con mayor presencia de DCL en la muestra total. Al estratificar por grupos de edad, la depresion, el ictus y la obesidad se asocian con DCL en los participantes de mediana edad (50+64 anos), mientras que un bajo nivel de actividad fisica y problemas de sueno se relacionan significativamente con DCL en el grupo de edad avanzada, lo que sugiere que los factores asociados a DCL podrian ser el reflejo de diversas etiologias. 3. La presencia de depresion incrementa el riesgo de desarrollar DCL a los tres anos de seguimiento. Esta asociacion no es significativamente diferente segun el subtipo de DCL (aDCL vs naDCL). 4. Mayores niveles de RC se asocian a una mejor calidad de vida autoreportada en la poblacion espanola de mediana y avanzada edad. Esta relacion queda parcialmente mediada por la depresion, el funcionamiento cognitivo y la discapacidad, siendo este ultimo factor el que muestra una mayor influencia (el 50% de la relacion entre RC y calidad de vida queda explicado por la discapacidad). En su conjunto, estos hallazgos contribuyen a aumentar el conocimiento sobre la caracterizacion del envejecimiento en una muestra representativa de la poblacion espanola. Puesto que se espera que la incidencia de demencia aumente drasticamente en los proximos anos, los profesionales de la salud se enfrentan al desafio de identificar, de forma precisa, a los individuos en las primeras etapas de la enfermedad, asi como los factores de riesgo asociados, como la depresion, que podrian retrasar o incluso prevenir, el inicio del deterioro cognitivo. Ademas, frente al proceso de envejecimiento, las intervenciones dirigidas a los factores modificables que componen la RC, que pueden ser entrenados y estimulados a lo largo de la vida, podrian llevar a un envejecimiento activo prolongando el funcionamiento autonomo de la persona y aumentando asi su calidad de vida.",

      "abstract": "With the exception of depression and cognitive changes, there has been relatively little attention paid to psychiatric disorders or to psychosocial and behavioral changes that may present after stroke. This article addresses that deficiency by reviewing psychiatric symptoms and syndromes and other psychosocial and behavioral problems that may present in the stroke survivor: mood disorders other than unipolar depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders, substance abuse, sexual dysfunction, sleep disturbance, organic mental disorders, and behavioral problems. The special concerns and functional impact these presentations have in the stroke population are discussed along with diagnostic and treatment options.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Das vorliegende Review beschäftigt sich mit kognitiven Störungen und Teilhabebeeinträchtigungen nach aneurysmatischen Subarachnoidalblutungen (aSAB). Diese können auch ohne den Nachweis einer substanziellen Hirnschädigung in der neuropsychologisch zu erwartenden Region auftreten. Als Ursache für diese Diskrepanz gelten neuroinflammatorische Prozesse und oxidativer Stress. Am häufigsten sind das verbale Gedächtnis, visuell-räumliche Fähigkeiten, das Gedächtnis für visuelle Inhalte, Aufmerksamkeit, Arbeitsgedächtnis, Exekutivfunktionen (Planung, Kontrolle, Problemlösung, Aufmerksamkeit, Entscheidungsfindung), die allgemeine kognitive Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit und die sprachliche Domäne betroffen. Es zeigt sich, dass das Vorhandensein kognitiver Beeinträchtigungen einen wesentlichen Risikofaktor darstellt, nicht mehr beruflich reintegriert werden zu können. Zusätzlich zu den kognitiven Symptomen treten nach einer aSAB auch gehäuft psychiatrische Symptome wie Angst, Depression und Fatigue auf. Diese wirken sich zusätzlich zu den körperlichen und kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen negativ auf die Teilhabe am beruflichen und sozialen Leben aus, was wiederum zu einer schlechteren Lebensqualität beiträgt.",

      "abstract": "Stroke merupakan gangguan fungsi saraf yang disebabkan oleh gangguan aliran darah dalam otak yang dapat timbul secara mendadak dalam beberapa detik atau secara cepat dalam beberapa jam dengan gejala atau tanda-tanda sesuai dengan daerah yang terganggu (Irfan, 2012). Sroke termasuk penyakit motorneuron atas yang mengakibatkan kehilangan kontrol volunter terhadap gerakan motorik, disfungsi motorik yang paling umum adalah kelemahan pada satu sisi karena lesi otak yang berlawanan, kelemahan otot merupakan dampak terbesar pada pasien stroke Pasien stroke dengan kelemahan akan mengalami keterbatasan mobilisasi. Klien yang mengalami keterbatasan dalam mobilisasi akan mengalami keterbatasan beberapa atau semua untuk melakukan rentang gerak dengan mandiri. Kelemahan fisik dan mental akan menghalangi seseorang aktivitas hidup sehari-hari. Secara umum, ketidakmampuan ada dua macam yaitu ketidakmampuan primer dan ketidakmampuan sekunder. Ketidakmampuan primer disebabkan oleh penyakit atau trauma (misal : paralisis gangguan atau cedera pada medula spinalis) sedangkan ketidakmampuan sekunder terjadi akibat dampak dari ketidakmampuan primer. Dari hasil penelitian didapatkan ada pengaruh antara terapi menggenggam bola terhadap kekuatan otot pasien stroke di RSSN Bukittinggi (p = 0,000).",

      "title": "Impact of Alcohol Use on Inhibitory Control (and Vice Versa) During Adolescence and Young Adulthood: A Review",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is usually the time when individuals first drink alcohol and this has been associated with relatively weak or immature inhibitory control. This review examines the changes on brain development and inhibitory function that take place during adolescence and youth as well as the relationship between inhibitory control and alcohol use at this early age.Narrative review of the chief studies related to (a) the development of inhibitory control during adolescence, (b) the deficits in the inhibitory ability in alcohol use disorders and (c) the effects of acute alcohol intake and binge drinking on inhibitory control in adolescents and young adults.Inhibitory control processes are developing during adolescence and youth. Poor inhibitory functions may predispose the individual to alcohol misuse. Likewise, acute and binge alcohol drinking may impair the inhibitory control and compromise the ability to prevent or stop behaviour related to alcohol use.Poor inhibitory control can be both the cause and the consequence of excessive alcohol use. Adolescence and young adulthood may be a particularly vulnerable period due to (a) the weak or immature inhibitory functioning typical of this stage may contribute to the inability of the individual to control alcohol use and (b) alcohol consumption per se may alter or interrupt the proper development of inhibitory control leading to a reduced ability to regulate alcohol intake. Further longitudinal research is needed to evaluate the interaction between inhibitory control dysfunction and alcohol use in both situations.",
