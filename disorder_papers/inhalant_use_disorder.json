      "abstract": "Low level of physical activity is often associated with other unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking or poor diet. When promoting good health and preventing illness on a population level, it might be a good idea to target several health behaviors in the same communication strategy. This systematic review looks at the effects of information and other communication initiatives on physical activity and on changes in one or more other lifestyle habit.The results of information and other communication initiatives show: Physical activity: increase in total amount of measured activity up to 6 months; little or no differences at longer follow up times. Intake of calories: unclear results up to 6 months, reduced intake between 13 and 24 months; unclear results at longer follow up times. Intake of fruit and vegetables: increased up to 6 months; little or no difference at longer follow up times. Use of computers and electronic games: small reduction measured up 12 months; little or no difference at longer follow up times. Self efficacy of diet, and self efficacy of diet and of physical activity: small increase up to 6 months, little or no difference for self efficacy of physical activity alone; no difference at longer follow up times. Body mass index, smoking and alcohol intake: unclear results.",

      "title": "Is the Outcome of Alcohol Dependence Treatment Related to Intelligence of Patients",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAlcohol is considered to be the leading cause of addiction in the world and its use over time does not diminish. Alcohol not only causes problems to people who are de- pendent on alcohol but also for a society as a whole because of its impact on health, welfare and the economy.1In Slovenia, for a decade or more, the officially registered consumption of pure alcohol per capita is around 11 liters. However, it is more realistic to estimate the pure alcohol consumption at around 15 liters because of the unchecked consumption of uncontrolled domestic production.2Harmful alcohol use is a transitional stage between a prudent drinker and a man who is alcohol dependent. Confirmation of the diagnosis of harmful alcohol use needs to meet one of the following criteria:3- repeated drinking prevents successful performance of the tasks at home or in the workplace;- the person drinks in circumstances where this may endanger himself or others;- recurring legal consequences, such as hardening of peace, driving under the influence of alcohol etc.;- repeated drinking despite problems in relationships caused by drinking.Longer harmful alcohol use may develop in the syndrome of alcohol dependence. Dependence is a medical condition in which a person, due to frequent, prolonged and excessive drinking becomes mentally or physically dependent on alcohol. The result is the typical behavior and thinking which is guided by a craving for alcohol and stick to drinking despite physical illness and adverse consequences in interpersonal relationships.3Treatment of alcohol dependenceTreatment may be roughly divided into three stages:- the preparatory phase,- the level of intensive care,- rehabilitation.In the preparatory phase a patient is deployed in a psychiatric clinic where psychiatrist performs ambulatory inspection and, if necessary, refers the person to check in to the clinical psychologist. The intensive treatment takes place in a mental institution or psychiatric hospital. »Length of stay« in the hospital is about 3 months. The second phase is followed by a third phase, which means the inclusion of the patients in the club for recovering alcoholics (in which their family members are also included) or inclusion in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).The goal of therapy is the abstinence. Patients who complete the treatment mostly return to the same environment in which they came up with excessive alcohol consumption, so it is important that the person after treatment is able to solve everyday problems without alcohol. Usually the patients are forced to treatment under pressure from family or employer and threatened with dismissal. During the treatment, patents become familiar with the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption and negative effects on their social life, cognitive ability and health. Modern methods of treatment allow a shift from inpatient to outpatient care but hospital care is often necessary, especially for people who can't establish abstinence in their own environment, have severe abstinence symptoms or mental illness or other medical complications, are deeply depressed or prone to suicide, or live in difficult social circumstances with weak support in their environment.3Intelligence in alcoholicsIntelligence is one of the major areas of psychological research. Most of authors understand intelligence as a general mental ability or general ability of effective thinking and problem solving, i.e. general intelligence factor.4'5General factor (g-factor) of intelligence is defined as a common denominator of all the components of our mental abilities. Spearman has an opinion that the achievements on tests of general intelligence are dependent on g-factor as well as the specific additional factors which he described as s-factor.4 Cattell introduced a division between fluid and crystallized intelligence.5Fluid abilities develop earlier and faster and are dependent on cognitive flexibility, adaptability and speed of information processing (e. …",

      "abstract": "Substance use refers to the intake of drugs, like alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, inhalants, tobacco, and other harmful substances that lead to the deterioration of oneself, society, or both. It comprises both physical dependence and psychological dependence. Physical dependence caused by excessive intake of a drug refers to a change in the physiological state in which withdrawal symptoms develop when drugs are discontinued whereas psychological dependence refers to the state of need to continue using the drug even without physical dependence. Substance use also known as drug abuse or drug addiction is usage of drugs up to a certain level that disrupts the individual return to its normal state or condition prior to the intake. It could range from mild, moderate or severe depending on the drug intake. Addiction can supposedly be a form of drug abuse in terms of severity. Addiction refers to the need to be associated with something (here a substance) ignoring the adverse effects it can cause. It can also refer to a strong inclination towards repeated use of a substance. The higher the addiction, the higher the risk of developing a substance use disorder (SUD).",

      "title": "Chili Drugs: Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), Gamma Hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Ketamine, and Agents Taken in Similar Patterns",
      "abstract": "Abstract Club drugs are typically taken by groups of people during raves. Raves are parties where the opportunity to dance to very loud, rhythmic music while under the influence of one or more drugs is the primary attraction. Needless to say, most users of club drugs under these conditions are young and single. Club drugs are usually taken periodically; several of them may be taken three to four times over the course of an 8-hour rave, and then they may not be taken again until the next opportunity to attend such a party. This is quite different from the pattern of opioid, nicotine, or alcohol abuse, where drug-seeking and drug-taking occur several times per day for months or years, or from the pattern of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse, where the drug may be taken as frequently as possible for several days of profound intoxication. In most cases, even periodic club drug use does not continue for more than a few years. For all but a few individuals, there is little indication that it is difficult to stop using these drugs. Some of the drugs, MDMA in particular, lose their ability to change the perceptions of some users in interesting ways, and these people effortlessly stop taking them. For these reasons, club drugs meet the criteria for abuse, but usually do not meet the criteria for addiction as these terms were defined in Chapter 1. Physiological dependence on some club drugs is possible, as noted below, but is rarely observed in people who take them only twice each week.",

      "title": "Depression and alcoholism",
      "abstract": "Drinking alcohol-containing beverages is a common habit in Western countries. In most Western societies, at least 90% of people consume alcohol at some time during their lives, and 30% or more of drinkers develop alcohol-related life problems.1 Severe alcohol-related life impairment, alcohol dependence, is observed at some time during their lives in ∼10% of men and 3–5% of women, with an additional 5–10% of each sex developing persistent but less intense problems that are diagnosed as abuse.1\n\nIndividuals with alcohol abuse are not dependent on alcohol, but have repeated legal, interpersonal, social, or occupational impairments related to alcohol consumption.1,,2 They frequently use alcohol in physically hazardous situations. If individuals with alcohol abuse continue to drink, they may go on to develop alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is characterized by tolerance (a need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve desired effect and/or markedly diminished effect with the continued use of the same amount of alcohol), and a withdrawal syndrome when alcohol is discontinued or intake is decreased. Alcohol-dependent individuals often spend a great deal of time using alcohol, and return to use despite evidence of physical and psychological problems. Alcohol abuse and dependence are commonly called alcoholism.\n\nDepression and alcoholism are associated with considerable morbidity, disability, and mortality, and co-occur more commonly than expected by chance.3–,8 The extent of comorbidity between depression and alcoholism was demonstrated by the results of several large epidemiological studies.3–,7 The National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a nationally representative survey in the US, found that compared with non-depressed respondents in the NCS, the lifetime odds of alcohol dependence were significantly elevated for both men (2.95) and women (4.05) with major depression.7 Conversely, NCS data demonstrated a two-fold increase …",

      "title": "Ingested poisons in adults",
      "abstract": "An ingested poison is considered any substance that's harmful to the body when ingested, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Any substance that's ingested can be poisonous if enough is consumed, even water. Poisons cause damage by altering cellular metabolism in a harmful or destructive way. They can act very quickly, within minutes in the case of heroin overdose, or over a period of time as with alcohol abuse. Most patients who've ingested a poison have minimal morbidity and fully recover within a short period of time. In this article, I'll discuss how to develop and utilize a general approach to the management of patients with suspected or confirmed poisoning. Unintentional or intentional? If a substance is ingested without intent to harm, it's assumed that it was an unintentional poisoning. This includes the consumption of drugs, medications, or other chemicals that are used in excessive amounts and result in an overdose. A poisoning is also considered unintentional when a substance is ingested accidentally and unknowingly, such as with children or older adults. When a substance is ingested with the intent to harm, it's considered an intentional poisoning, such as in a suicide attempt or assault on another person. When you can't make the distinction between the two because of circumstances, then the poisoning may be considered undetermined until proven otherwise. Substances most likely to be ingested include over-the-counter pain medicines, cleaning products, cosmetics, plants, prescription medications, and cough and cold preparations. Fatalities usually result from the ingestion of analgesics, sedative-hypnotics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, illegal drugs, cardiovascular medications, or alcohol.FigureTo evaluate a patient suspected of poisoning, you must discover what the likely poison is and when the ingestion occurred and assess the severity of the poisoning and the likelihood for toxicity. Nursing management is geared toward supportive care, preventing further absorption, and providing antidotes or promoting the elimination of the poison. Remember, the sequence, methods, and priorities of management are dictated by the poison and the severity of its presentation. The phases of poisoning are as follows: preclinical phase—some signs and symptoms may not be evident during this phase; the priority is decontamination toxic phase—signs and symptoms and lab changes are evident during this phase and guide treatment; the emphasis is on shortening the duration of poisoning and lessening the severity of toxicity resolution phase—this phase encompasses peak toxicity to recovery; the goal is to shorten the duration of toxicity. Initially speaking Your initial physical exam of the patient will focus on the ABCs—airway, breathing, and circulation—to stabilize him and prevent any further deterioration. Always ensure that his airway is patent; any doubt should prompt you to prepare for endotracheal intubation. Act quickly, but remain cool and observant. Signs and symptoms are important clues to identifying a poison, such as noticing there are burns on the patient's mouth. If the patient vomits, collect the vomitus and send it to the lab for analysis. Assess his vital signs, including pulse oximetry value and blood glucose level; assess and record his mental status and pupil size; obtain blood tests and urine samples as ordered; and make sure appropriate advanced cardiac life support measures are immediately available. Next, you'll want to confirm the history of the poisoning and correlate it with the information gathered from your initial survey. Sometimes you may need to talk with the paramedics, the patient's family or friends, or the police to gather sufficient information. Ask about the presence of pill bottles, medications, drug paraphernalia, empty bottles of alcohol, or a suicide note. If you suspect an overdose of medication, ask to see the pill bottles or the actual pills or ask for a description of the pills. If a substance can't be identified, call your local poison control center or check the computerized poison identification system or material safety data sheet. A computerized ID system gives you instant access to critical information about the management of exposure, such as clinical effects, range of toxicity, and treatment of specific and general categories of substances. A material safety data sheet provides comprehensive information regarding the physical properties, toxicity, physical effects, reactivity, proper storage and disposal, protective equipment, first aid, and containment process associated with a specific substance. Imaging tests may be warranted to determine the location, source, and likelihood of what was ingested. A chest X-ray may reveal undigested metals, radiopaque foreign bodies, or drug packets, vials, or supplies (called body packing, the internal concealment of illegal drugs such as heroin). Continue to assess the patient's vital signs, mental status, and pupil size repeatedly (from every 15 to 30 minutes to every hour). Check for the following: physiologic excitation (increased agitation, BP, respiratory rate, pulse, temperature, and pupil dilation) physiologic depression (coma; somnolence; diminished BP, respiratory rate, pulse, and temperature; and pupil constriction) odors (bodily or breath) acetone (fruity), caused by ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, chloroform, or salicylates bitter almond, caused by cyanide garlic, caused by arsenic, organophosphates, phosphorus, thallium, or selenium rotten eggs, caused by hydrogen sulfide wintergreen, caused by methyl salicylate. For more information about how to use assessment findings to help determine what type of poison is causing your patient's signs and symptoms, see Pinpointing poison's effects. Decontamination and antidotes After the patient is stabilized, some degree of decontamination should be initiated as soon as possible. Options include: activated charcoal to prevent further absorption (check for bowel obstruction, ileus, perforation, or significant gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding) whole bowel irrigation performed orally or via a nasogastric (NG) tube, usually in conjunction with sodium bicarbonate osmotic laxative solution; can be given after activated charcoal, especially if symptoms continue or if continued poisoning is suspected (check for bowel obstruction, ileus, perforation, or significant GI bleeding) cathartics, such as sorbitol, to decrease absorption by enhancing rectal evacuation of the poison; can be given after activated charcoal (check for bowel obstruction, perforation, ileus, electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, or renal insufficiency) administration of an antidote (see Common antidotes used in the ED). Table: Common antidotes used in the EDWith more severe and life-threatening cases, decontamination options include repeated doses of activated charcoal, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, hemofiltration, and exchange transfusion. Tailoring nursing interventions An important aspect of caring for a poisoned patient is understanding the course of management thus far and tailoring your nursing interventions accordingly. Ongoing interventions include: ensuring airway patency and assessing for the risk of aspiration, especially after any gastric decontamination process (make sure adequate suctioning equipment is readily available) checking vital signs and monitoring for hypotension or hypertension ensuring telemetry monitoring is intact and active (check for ventricular tachycardias or bradyarrhythmias with hypotension) initiating seizures precautions if necessary. After successful decontamination, a short period of observation will be warranted and a disposition determination will be based on the observed and predicted severity of toxicity. Mild presentations of toxicity may only require a short period of observation for 4 to 12 hours in the ED, but moderate to high levels of toxicity may require admission to the hospital intermediate care floor, observational units, or ICU on the basis of the patient's history and clinical data. Keep in mind that any concern for an underlying psychiatric condition should warrant a consultation. Discharge may also be hindered by predisposing factors, such as likelihood for assault or unsafe home environments, unresolved intent to harm oneself or others, inadequate support services at home, financial hardship, and concern over recurrences of unintentional poisoning (such as inadequate lighting at home, multiple medications, blindness, or physical disability). Calm, cool, and collected While the management of an adult who has ingested a poison can be a daunting and frightening experience, by remaining observant and knowing where to look and whom to ask for information, you can ensure a favorable outcome for your patient.

Jika efek ini terus terjadi, tubuh akan kejang-kejang, muncul halusinasi, perilaku lebih agresif, dan rasa sesak pada bagian dada. Jangka panjang dari dampak dehidrasi ini dapat menyebabkan kerusakan pada otak. Tidak hanya itu saja, dalam dosis berlebih juga bisa menyebabkan muntah, mual, rasa takut yang berlebih, serta gangguan kecemasan. Apabila pemakaian dalam jangka panjang, bisa mengakibatkan dampak yang lebih buruk seperti gangguan mental, depresi, serta kecemasan terus-menerus. Pemakai yang menggunakan obat-obatan tersebut dalam dosis yang berlebih, efeknya justru membuat tubuh terlalu rileks sehingga kesadaran berkurang drastis. Beberapa kasus si pemakai tidur secara terus-menerus dan tidak bangun-bangun. Hilangnya kesadaran tersebut membuat koordinasi tubuh terganggu, sering bingung, dan terjadi perubahan perilaku. Dampak narkoba yang cukup berisiko tinggi adalah hilangnya ingatan sehingga sulit mengenali lingkungan sekitar. Dampak narkoba yang paling buruk terjadi jika si pemakai menggunakan obat-obatan tersebut dalam dosis yang tinggi atau yang dikenal dengan overdosis. Pemakaian sabu-sabu, opium, dan kokain bisa menyebabkan tubuh kejang-kejang dan jika dibiarkan dapat menimbulkan kematian. Inilah akibat fatal yang harus dihadapi jika sampai kecanduan narkotika, nyawa menjadi taruhannya. Bahaya narkoba bukan hanya berdampak buruk bagi kondisi tubuh, penggunaan obat-obatan tersebut juga bisa mempengaruhi kualitas hidup misalnya susah berkonsentrasi saat bekerja, mengalami masalah keuangan, hingga harus berurusan dengan pihak kepolisian jika terbukti melanggar hukum. Pemakaian zat-zat narkotika hanya diperbolehkan untuk kepentingan medis sesuai dengan pengawasan dokter dan juga untuk keperluan penelitian. Selebihnya, obat-obatan tersebut tidak memberikan dampak positif bagi tubuh. Yang ada, kualitas hidup menjadi terganggu, relasi dengan keluarga kacau, kesehatan menurun, dan yang paling buruk adalah menyebabkan kematian. Karena itu, jangan coba-coba memakai barang berbahaya tersebut karena resikonya sangat tinggi bagi hidup dan kesehatan.",

      "title": "Alcohol Use Disorder",
      "abstract": "Millions of individuals use alcohol every day; however, not everyone experiences a problem due to such use. It is therefore helpful to conceptualize alcohol use as ranging on a continuum from nonproblematic social use (e.g., a glass of wine with dinner); to alcohol misuse (e.g., a one-time incident of binge drinking); to excessive use or abuse (e.g., frequent use of alcohol that results in a negative impact on the life of the individual and those around him or her, such as recurrent driving under the influence of alcohol); and finally, to physical dependence or addiction to alcohol (e.g., a chronic disorder that may require medical detoxification and/or formal treatment). While not used professionally, the commonly used term alcoholism has been used synonymously with alcohol addiction and refers to the compulsive use of alcoholic beverages. Both terms imply a progressive deterioration of the individual’s social, physical, and mental status combined with the inability to stop using alcohol even when wishing to do so. Although the professional literature on alcohol use problems is extensive and can be found in almost every country in the world, the inconsistent use of terminology is often confusing. There are tremendous overlaps among literature on topics such as alcohol-related problems, risky drinking, hazardous drinking, alcohol abuse and dependence, substance abuse, and alcohol addiction. The confusion has been compounded by the changes in the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2013), which eliminated the previous diagnostic classifications of “alcohol abuse” and “alcohol dependence” and replace them with the overall category of “Alcohol Use Disorders” (AUD), which itself is part of the broader new DSM-5 category of “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders.” A fuller discussion of the DSM changes can be seen in S. Lala A. Straussner’s 2013 article “The DSM–5 diagnostic criteria: What’s new?” Journal of Social Work Practice in the Addictions. Research studies in the United States indicate a general decrease in the proportions of individuals with “pure” alcohol use diagnosis and an increase among those using multiple substances. Consequently, the topic of alcohol-use disorders needs to be considered within the context of the literature on problematic use of a variety of other chemical substances as well as other addictions, such as gambling and smoking. It also needs to take into account co-occurring mental disorders; age, gender, and sexual identity of users; socioeconomic and psychological issues; family dynamics; and ethnocultural factors. Finally, research and treatment focusing on AUD must be viewed within the context of governmental policies, which vary over time and in different locations.",

Illicit \"snorting\" or freebase smoking has increased markedly in recent years. Decreased olfaction has been an often reported subjective complaint of cocaine abusers, but quantification of smell loss using sensitive psychophysical tests has not yet been done, leading to the present study. Eleven cocaine abusers were recruited from a drug treatment clinic. Olfaction was assessed using a butanol threshold test, the UPSIT, and a 7-item discrimination test. One patient tested anosmic, one had a mild discrimination problem, and one had a large septal perforation but was normosmic. From the present study, it appears that most cocaine abusers, even heavy users or those with intranasal damage, do not develop permanent olfactory dysfunction. It is not clear what factors may have resulted in complaints of olfactory loss in previous studies.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this essay was to find out why people who had used alcohol and narcotics for a long time, stoped using drugs. If there were any special occurrences, personal skills or surroundings that influenced sobernes. The main questions were: · Why stop using drugs? · How has the way to a drug free life turned out? · Were there any special occurrances or factors that started the drug free life? · Has the lack of permenent habitation effected the situation? I have intervjued five former drug addicts together with studying of literature, articles and former research. I have focused on my informers subjective picture of their reality and analysed the answers from a qualitative perspective. The conclusions has been that staying of drugs is a complicated process that involves identity, economi, physical and mental health, capacity of participation in society and support. Reasons to quit drugs has been an occurrance, loss of something inportant, disease or to reach the personal bottom. The importance of having somewhere to live nevertheless in the drug free life, but in general, drug free or not..",

      "abstract": "Background: Synthetic tobacco is a type of tobacco made from a mixture of chemicals.This mixture is then sprayed on pieces of leaves or tobacco cigarettes and then rolled like using marijuana by smoking.Its chemicals are deliberately artificially created to mimic the effects of marijuana or ecstasy.The effects of synthetic tobacco include excessive pleasure, hallucinations, confusion, anxiety, and dependence (addictive). Method:We selected several references from textbooks and journals until 2023 containing information about synthetic cannabinoids.Case report: An 18-year-old man used synthetic tobacco for one year and claimed to feel calm after consuming it, which caused a desire to continue consuming it every day until the last two weeks.The patient was known to consume this synthetic tobacco more often than usual, so the patient experienced hallucinations and continued to want to consume this type of tobacco.The patient experiences symptoms of auditory hallucinations.The patient also feels anxious, looks confused, and feels like a gorilla hit him because it made his body stiff, and he was unable to move. Conclusion:Some signs and symptoms overlap between cannabis and synthetic cannabis.Doctors who confirmed the use of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) need to be vigilant in providing supportive care and can perform supporting examinations to support diagnosis if needed.",

      "abstract": "Three cases of methamphetamine abuse by smoking were reported. The oral intake and the intravenous injection of the drug are usually adopted, and the smoking is recently found among the stimulant abusers in Japan. The stimulant is heated on a piece of aluminium foil with a lighter and its smoke is inhaled with a straw or a paper pipe. The intake means are identical to \"crystal or ice\" in Hawaii, although a special glass pipe or a cigarette is not used here. The effect of the drug obtained by smoking is more slack and mild than that by a intravenous injection, although the drug of the double dose is used in the smoking. Two cases changed the intake means from the injection to the smoking because of no guilty feeling and a lack of injection marks and evident proofs of illegal use. Therefore, abuse of methamphetamine by smoking is thought to increase in near future in Japan, and the delusion of arrest by policemen observed frequently in the stimulant abusers maybe decreases as a result of a decrease in the psychological stress of guilty.",

      "title": "Reducing the costs of alcohol in the workplace: the case for employer policies",
      "abstract": "More than 90% of the UK workforce drink alcohol and as many as 30% of male employees and 23% of female employees could be consuming quantities above ‘safe limits’. Survey results also indicate that the vast majority of dependent drinkers are in employment, Current evidence suggests that alcohol consumption, in or out of work time, can result in lower productivity, increased absenteeism and sickness absence, and increased accident rates. The annual value of industrial days lost though alcohol consumption in the UK since 1987 is estimated to be over £1.7 billion, excluding the value of lost productivity, accidents and injury. Alcohol acts as a depressant, impairing reasoning, memory, perception, balance and coordination skills even at very moderate levels of consumption. Physical and intellectual ability decline as more alcohol is consumed either at work or at leisure. In the longer run, continued consumption can lead to disease, emotional and social problems, chronic illness and even premature death. Because the majority of drinkers are in employment, these effects will have an impact in the workplace. Some adverse consequences at work are related to excessive alcohol misuse by a minority of employees, but most are associated with the moderate but inappropriate drinking behaviour of the majority. Existing evidence implies that alcohol is involved in at least one fifth of all UK industrial accidents. The probability of an accident increases six fold for the average man who has consumed two pints of beer, and risk-taking behaviour increases and decision making skills decrease even with low levels of consumption. One in ten men and one in twenty women report feelings the effects of a hangover at work and in one UK study, a quarter of all of the men interviewed reported regular lunchtime drinking. Up to 60% of USA corporations have introduced formal workplace policies of different types in order to reduce employment costs associated with alcohol consumption. However, less than 20% of UK firms have taken similar action. Workplace policies are designed to identify problem drinkers at an early stage and to provide treatment, avoiding the need for disciplinary procedures. Although many USA studies have shown workplace policies to be cost-effective, some studies report conflicting results using different definitions of successful outcome and policy goals. Many studies suffer from statistical defects and the poor definition of appropriate policy goals. The economic case for increasing the number and type of workplace policies in the UK cannot be confirmed without a consistent framework for evaluating cost-efficiency. Evidence of employment costs associated with alcohol consumption are examined in this paper and the need for further information identified. A framework for evaluating costs and benefits is outlined as a basis for future policy discussion, and the economic evaluation of alcohol workplace policies in the UK.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction and drug abuse, chronic or habitual use of any chemical substance to alter states of body or mind for other than medically warranted purposes. Addiction is more often now defined by the continuing, compulsive nature of the drug use despite physical and/or psychological harm to the user and society and includes both licit and illicit drugs, and the term \"substance abuse\" is now frequently used because of the broad range of substances (including alcohol and inhalants) that can fit the addictive profile. Psychological dependence is the subjective feeling that the user needs the drug to maintain a feeling of well-being; physical dependence is characterized by tolerance (the need for increasingly larger doses in order to achieve the initial effect) and withdrawal symptoms when the user is abstinent. There are a lot of effects of drug addiction to the economy, society, and family. Drug addiction affects individual's physical and mental health. Drug addicts are burden for a family and society. It is a great challenge for all nations of the world to prevent drug addiction. This article reviews the effects of drug addiction in details.

      "title": "Inhalant Abuse as an Adolescent Drug Problem: An",
      "abstract": "The inhalation of the vapors of chemical substances for the purpose of achieving an intoxicated state is currently quite popular within the adolescent popula- tion. However, this form of substance abuse often receives less attention than more well-known drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol. This paper is intended to be an introduction to the topic of inhalant abuse, including prevalence rates, the types of substances typically abused, their effects on the body, methods of inhalation, symptoms associated with this practice, the risks involved, and finally, the question of physical and psychological addiction. When the topic of substance abuse among adolescents is discussed, drugs such as marijuana, LSD, crack, and amphetamines tend to be- come focal points. One group of substances that is often overlooked or given only marginal attention is generally known as inhalants, a large number of products whose vapors can be inhaled in order to achieve an intoxicated state. The fact that these substances are abused to an equal (or even greater) extent than those drugs men- tioned above (Johnson, O'Malley, & Bachman, 1987; Oetting & Beau- vais, 1990), and yet are generally ignored by the public at large, may suggest that people are unaware of the existence of inhalant abuse, that they are unaware of the wide prevalence of this practice, and/or that they are simply unaware of the hazards involved in the abuse of inhalants.",

      "title": "Aging With or Aging Out of Drug Use? Older Adults’ Experiences of Aging with Long-Term Drug Use",
      "abstract": "Older adults with long-term drug use have long been overlooked in both drug research and aging research. More knowledge is needed about their experiences and needs. Drug use is often seen as a youth phenomenon and as something that with time leads to destructiveness and compulsion. A more nuanced picture of who uses drugs and what the use may look like over time is necessary. There is limited insight into what it means to age with drug use, based on individuals’ own stories and experiences. We conducted 27 semistructured interviews in Sweden with individuals aged 55 or older who reported current and long-term drug use. In this article, we demonstrate how the relationship with drugs evolves over time and how the interviewees contemplate stopping or continuing their use. Three themes were identified: (1) Aging out of drug use: Thoughts on drug cessation. Some expressed a desire to end their drug use. The reasons behind this varied, but there was a clear pattern related to older age. (2) Aging with drug use: Thoughts on continued use. Some had a desire to continue using drugs and expressed concern about how everyday life would be without them. (3) Age adapted drug use: A change in drug use. Several participants stated that their drug consumption had changed over time and with age. Drugs no longer dominated their lives as before but still served essential functions. The themes should not be seen as rigid categories, but as fluid narratives. Understanding this variation provides a deeper insight into people's often complex relationship with drugs.",

      "title": "Cannabis Toxicity and Adverse Biological Activity",
      "abstract": "Consideration of cannabis as a medicinal entity is an ongoing discussion that requires additional clinical and laboratory research. Marijuana smoking deposits 4x times more tar in the lungs as compared to tobacco smoke and amount of some pro-carcinogens are up to 2x times greater in marijuana tar. Determination of Dependence/Physical Harm relationship by investigators shows a proximity of cannabis to khat, LSD, ecstasy, alkyl nitrites, and methylphenidate. Non-users that are exposed to cannabis inhalant may suffer loss of coordination, dizziness, confusion, difficulty walking, blurred vision, and vomiting. Illicit drug use has been shown to be strongly associated with homicide events. Psychotropic effects from THC inhalant reaches a maximum after 15 to 30 minutes. Psychotropic effects from oral ingestion of THC reaches maximum level after 2 to 3 hours. Marijuana smoke contains higher levels of specific toxins than tobacco smoke. Ongoing research outcome challenges the concept that marijuana smoke is less harmful than tobacco smoke. Marijuana smoke causes lung damage quickly and could out pace tobacco smoke by as much as 20 years. Studies has shown cannabis usage worsens the course of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and that adolescents possess a greater risk from cannabis than older individuals. Cannabis abuse could be an independent risk factor for the further development of psychotic disorders. Further research and study is warranted concerning clinical application of cannabis.  2010 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA",

      "abstract": "Drug misuse is common, and users of illicit drugs tend to be young. Many have children. A serious drug misuse problem in the parents can be devastating for the lives of their children.1Addiction to opiates, most commonly heroin, is one of the forms of drug misuse that is potentially most damaging to the child's home environment. Recent figures produced by the European Commission suggest that about 0.2–0.3% of European adults fulfil diagnostic criteria for heroin addiction at any given time,2 and higher rates exist in inner city areas. Department of Health figures suggest that heroin use is the form of drug misuse most commonly presented to treatment services in the United Kingdom.3 \n\nThe financial pressure of obtaining large sums of money (typically £10–100 a day) to buy heroin can lock a person into a daily cycle of seeking out, buying, and using heroin, which can lead to poverty, criminal activity, and imprisonment.4 Chaotic lifestyles may preclude attention being given to basics such as nutrition and attending appointments, and may lead to the presence of unsafe persons in the home, unsuitable carers, and frequent parental absences. Dependent heroin users are also at greatly increased risk of death from overdose, infectious diseases, and other causes.4Addiction to stimulants such as amphetamines and crack cocaine may also produce adverse home circumstances, although anonymous testing of pregnant women suggests that there does not yet appear to be the misuse of these drugs in epidemic proportions in the United Kingdom that is reported in the United States.5 \n\nIt is difficult to obtain clear figures about the scale of parental drug use and the numbers of children affected. Each NHS region has a regional drug misuse database containing details of all new drug users presenting for treatment and those …",

Substance use is defined as taking a substance into the body for an intended purpose, such as behavioural or emotional change. According to, substance users are individuals who have rejected imposed cultural goals and the means to achieve those goals. Alcohol, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and tobacco/nicotine among many others have been the major substances used among adolescents and young adult population especially in Nigeria. According to use of substances may occur without having a significant impact on an individual’s functioning, but when tolerance is built and use increases, even at the expense of work or school, relationships, or one’s own health or safety, this can indicate a substance use disorder.",

They might use alcohol or other recreational drugs to fit in with their peers, stay alert, overcome shyness, relax or simply because they enjoy the feeling it gives them. Perhaps it is this latter element - the feeling of pleasure - that poses one of the greatest challenges to the development of successful drug strategies and health promotion messages. If we avoid the pleasurable aspect associated with the use of recreational drugs, is there a risk that interventions to reduce drug harm will lack credibility and be less effective?",

Recent experimental trends, such as microdosing, have helped promote the use of hallucinogens on campus, and students may be tempted to use these substances due to their beliefs about the drugs’ positive effects on mood. Although hallucinogens are not currently an established form of medical therapy, studies have shown that they have significant benefits as adjunctive treatments for psychological disorders. However, the recreational use of these drugs in college students often occurs in uncontrolled doses or with drug mixing, which is often dangerous. Furthermore, students with mental health disorders may have their symptoms masked by hallucinogenic drug use, which could delay treatment and have serious consequences. Long-term use of these drugs may also result in tolerance or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. This article attempts to review current information regarding hallucinogen use and how it applies to the college population.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, may be a disease that affects an individual's brain and behaviour and results in an inability to regulate the utilization of a legal or illegal drug or medication. Substances like alcohol, marijuana and nicotine are also considered drugs. When you're addicted, you'll continue using the drug despite the harm it causes . Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a narcotic in social situations, and, for a few people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, white plague begins with exposure to prescribed medications, or receiving medications from a lover or relative who has been prescribed the medication. The risk of addiction and the way fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, like opioid painkillers, have a better risk and cause addiction more quickly than others. As time passes, you'll need larger doses of the drug to urge high. Soon you'll need the drug just to feel good. As your drug use increases, you'll find that it's increasingly difficult to travel without the drug. Attempts to prevent drug use may cause intense cravings and cause you to feel physically ill (withdrawal symptoms). You may need help from your doctor, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program to beat your white plague and stay drug-free. Drug addiction isn’t about just heroin, cocaine, or other illegal drugs. You can get hooked in to alcohol, nicotine, opioid painkillers, and other legal substances. At first, you'll prefer to take a drug because you wish the way it causes you to feel. You may think you can control how much and how often you use it. But over time, drugs change how your brain works. These physical changes can last a long time. They make you lose self-control and may lead you to damaging behaviours.",

      "abstract": "Many cannabis users 'mature out' of their drug use, and factors of cannabis use cessation have been identified. However, very little in-depth knowledge is available about the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Criminological studies have gained interesting insights in desistance from crime, yet these perspectives are rarely used in drug research. This qualitative, three-year longitudinal study explored the processes involved in desistance from frequent cannabis use for young adults. Using a narrative approach, desisters (frequent users who successfully quit their cannabis use) and persisters (frequent users with a persistent desire and unsuccessful attempts to quit) were compared. In the course of the study, desisters mainly exhibited increasing agency and goal setting, established strategies to achieve these goals, and could envision another self. Desistance was generally induced by life events that became turning points. Persisters experienced largely similar events, but lacked goals and strategies and held external factors responsible for their life course and failed quit attempts. Identity change is at the core of desistance from frequent cannabis use, and the meaning-giving to life events and experiences is essential. Agency is a necessary ingredient for desistance, develops over time and through action, and leads to a new drug-free identity with desistance in turn increasing agency.",

      "abstract": "More and more paediatricians are confronted with teen drinking and the problems that result from it. A new trend is the so called “binge-drinking”. This means consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol in a very short period of time with the goal of getting drunk as fast as possible. Within 1 hour after ingestion, alcohol is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. Toxic effects of alcohol can occur from a plasma concentration of 0.5–1‰ (= 500–1000 mg/l) or an intake of 600 mg/kg alcohol. This is equal to ingestion of 120 ml liquor (alcohol concentration 30%) in an adolescent of 40kg. The effects are caused by a suppression of the central nervous system and they occur faster in younger people than in adults due to less extracellular volume. Also individual factors like gender, use of other medications or drugs and drinking habits play a role. All this factors can result in a broad spectrum of symptoms (relaxation, altered perception of the environment, prolonged reaction time, amnesia, nausea, vomiting and in more severe cases respiratory depression, coma and death). When a child with possible alcohol intoxication is admitted to the emergency department, general “APLS” guidelines (Advanced Pediatric Life Support) should be followed. After the “acute” event of the alcohol intoxication, multidisciplinary follow-up of the patient is very important. In Belgium, no objective data exist on the problem of binge drinking whilst among paediatricians there is great concern about it. Therefore, we will conduct a national survey on this topic.",

      "title": "Causes of Drug Use and Methods of Legal Treatment",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction or use dates back to ancient times, with its roots lying in the human use of certain plants containing substances that alter mental states, perception, and sensations for thousands of years. These substances were used either to experience pleasure, alleviate the pain of a particular patient, endure suffering, or forget a painful life and its burdens. Drugs play a significant role in encouraging individuals to commit various crimes due to their impact on the nervous and sensory systems. Furthermore, drug abuse has become one of the most pressing problems and challenges facing our society, posing severe threats to families and youth and warning of potential disintegration. Regardless of the form or type of drug, it remains one of the most dangerous social issues and plagues that harm our community due to its profoundly negative effects on individuals, families, and society at large.One of the causes behind the prevalence of drug use is the high unemployment rate and lack of job opportunities within Iraqi society, leading to idle individuals who, with excess free time, may turn to drug addiction. Additionally, poverty becomes a bias, with the influential factor being the creation of a strong and urgent desire that drives drug users to obtain substances by any means and gradually increase their dosage. Other significant causes of drug use or addiction include family environment, bad company, working conditions, general social influences, or the desire to escape from one's social or economic reality. In some cases, sudden wealth among certain families may also contribute to drug abuse. As a result, drug abuse has become a focal issue throughout Iraq due to its destructive impact on Iraqi society. It is a primary factor in numerous social, security, economic, and health problems, leading Iraqi society to invest considerable energy and financial resources in preventing its spread and mitigating its effects on individuals and the community. This has been addressed through various legal and other means. The significance of this study lies in understanding how drug users can reintegrate into society as normal individuals without suffering from physical or psychological disorders resulting from drug addiction. This can only be achieved through understanding and addressing treatment methods and attempts to eliminate the causes of drug use or addiction. Officials must exercise caution and consider this issue to ensure that drug users are free from drugs and their negative consequences",

Alcohol readily crosses the placenta and enters the fetus' bloodstream. Alcohol is metabolized and eliminated much more slowly in the fetus and in the newborn than in the mother. Recreational drugs such as heroin, methadone, cocaine, crack, and marijuana have been noted to have deleterious effects on the fetus and newborn when used by the mother during pregnancy. The exercise of pregnant women must be closely monitored because of the dramatic physiological changes induced by pregnancy. The immediate effect of exercise is that blood is diverted from the uterus to the legs. Drinking alcohol, using cocaine, and engaging in exercise programs are not isolated events randomly distributed across the population. Contradictions between animal and human studies may be due to the voluntary nature of exercise in humans, which may be less stressful than forced exercise or other stressors used in animal studies.",

      "title": "Growing Trend Of Drug Abuse And Misuse And Its Impact On Society A Case Study Of Hyderabad City",
      "abstract": "Drug abuse is the consumption of drug apart from medical need or use, in unnecessary or in excessive quantities.Drug misuse is the use of drugs for the purpose or conditions for which they are not suitable choice or even if they are suitable choice but used in improper dosage.The menace of drug misuse and abuse is increasing globally day by day and Hyderabad being one of the largest cities of Pakistan is experiencing this practice widely.Psychoactive drugs, sedatives, hypnotics, antibiotics, multivitamins, laxatives, heavy tonics, steroids, antacids, cough syrups and analgesics etc, are commonly misused and abused in our society.Among these psychoactive agents and antibiotics are the most frequently misused and abused drugs.Psychoactive agents have great potential for physiological and psychological addiction hence the users continuously use them to cope the situation of anxiety, insomnia, depression and pain. It has been observed that repeated use of such agents creates tolerance, which leads to frequent increase in dose of the drug.On other hand, misuse of antibiotics leads to microbial resistance ultimately leading to decreased efficiency of the drug in particular family or community.Self medication and over medication have become the norm.Self medication is risky and highly unsafe and at times dangerous too, it leads to misuse and abuse as well.Non-medically qualified people (Quacks / Store keepers) are not able to judge the correct use of medication or determine the dose, nor are they aware of the risks involved in drug misuse and abuse.It is because all the drugs which are available in market have great potential to be misused and abused.\r\nThe initially oobserved causes of drug abuse and misuse are lack of patient’s awareness regarding side effects or complications of drugs, improper patients’ counseling, prescriber’s lust for heavy OPD (because of which incomplete message regarding proper usage of drug is transferred to patients), wrong prescription (generated by unqualified people), prescriptions error, drug advertisement, busy pharmacies, easy availability of controlled drugs, dispensing error, pharmacies or medical stores being run without professional person (without registered Pharmacist), Improper follow-up of patients, lack of concentration of drug regulating agencies and unethical promotions of pharmaceutical companies etc.Lack of patient counseling has a significant role in drug misuse and may result in drug abuse or addiction.Prescription error is one the most important factor that leads to drug misuse and abuse.A prescribing error occurs as a result of a prescribing decision or during prescription writing process.Prescription writing skills / instructions should be according to the WHO guidelines which suggest giving the medicine to the patients in the proper manner by Pharmacist / dispenser / storing keeper.Many countries have adopted WHO guideline for the prescription in their health care system.The Pharmacist is the person professionally equipped with knowledge to understand all the drawbacks /complications of drug abuse and misuse and its harmful impacts on health of people.The objectives of this study are to explore the causes of drug misuse, abuse and their contributing factors in Hyderabad city.The survey study was conducted in different main targeted areas of Hyderabad city A questionnaire and analysis sheets were designed with the study objectives. W.H.O parameters (World Health Organization Guidelines / Standards) for prescriptions writings,Drug information hand book (Lexi-comp) and BNF (British National formulary) were used for evaluation of proper dose of dosage form and drug-drug interaction. Ms-Office 2007 and Statistical tools such as Mean, Standard Deviation, Cumulative Frequencies,Relative Frequencies, Chi square test, Z test, ANOVA, Regression Analysis, and Graphical Representation of data have been applied through the Statistical package SPSS17.0.Trend of sales at medical stores in Hyderabad city shows that sale with prescription is 41.6% and without prescription is 58.4%.It reflects easy availability ofvdrugs on large scale without prescription whereas on other side 49.4% of patients/customers were even not asked about availability of doctors’ prescription by medical store keeper.\r\nAmong the interviewed customers/patients male (62.4%) and female (37.6%) responded positively. It was observed that 29.1% patients/customers were between 31–45years ages. Maximum patients/customers without prescription (13.7%) were found in Pretabad, Hyderabad, on other hand maximum patients/customers with prescription (8.6%) were found in Saddar, Hyderabad, respectively.The available prescriptions (41.6%) were evaluated and categorized in four types.As Specialist prescriptions (56.4%), General practitioner prescriptions (19.8%),Hospital /Medical center prescriptions (15.7%) and prescriptions without name and address of doctor (8.1%); this includes non qualified persons/quacks as well. As the prescription error factor in drug misuse was considered the error was 30.6% in all prescriptions categories, whereas maximum errors were found in the prescriptions, which were without name and address of prescribers.Collectively 8.3% prescriptions were found very old and 11.8% were without date of generation of prescription.Trend of self medication is another factor of drug misuse identified on large scale in Hyderabad.According to data collected from patients/customers without prescription (58.4%), the decision of self medication, 55.8%, is influenced /suggested by self judgment, chemist, drug advertisement, friends, relatives,neighbors etc.and about 44.2% patients/customers were influenced by doctor.Majority of these customers/patients, 43.6%, were not clear regarding dose, frequency and duration of therapy.In 7.4% cases medicines were sold to 46 years age customers are involved mostly in drug misuse and abuse.Furthermore, 500 Patients/Respondents were interviewed in Out Patient’s Department (OPD) of a government hospital in Hyderabad to analyze the contribution of improper patient counseling factor in drug misuse and abuse.Out of 500 patients,\\159 (31.8%) were not counseled by any health professional, whereas 341 (68.2%) were counseled by the prescriber, store keeper/dispenser or both.Out of 159 uncounseled patients, the highest number of patients 76 (47.7%) were unaware regarding duration of therapy.On the other hand, among 341(68%) counseled patients, 218 (63.92%) were counseled by both prescriber and storekeeper/dispenser, 65(19.06%) by prescriber only and 58(17.0%) by store keeper / dispenser only.The underlying reasons for improper counseling may be lack of pharmacist in hospital settings, heavy OPDs and busy pharmacies. Since the calculated value Z = 9.7061 falls in the critical region, so we reject the null hypothesis, it shows P1 ≠ P2, at 0.05 level of significance and concludes on the basis of data, that the proportion of both gender (male and female) are different with respect to the drug misuse and abuse.\r\nAdditionally a total of 286 antibiotic containing prescriptions were randomly sampled from a government hospital.These prescriptions were categorized according to the antibiotic classes and errors were identified according to various standards W.H.O (World Health Organization) guidelines/standards for prescription writing.The extent of errors were calculated and the highest proportion of the prescriptions (89.86%, n=257) failed to demonstrate the patient’s weight and the least number of prescriptions (2.44%, n=07) contained the dosage form errors.The mean error per prescription was observed as 6.35 with S.D 3.138 and 95% confidence interval for μ is (5.98, 6.71).The major reasons were heavy patients’ influx, insufficient knowledge regarding prescription writing guidelines to prescribers and the lack of pharmacists. Continuous educational training programs regarding prescription writing skills, introduction of computerized prescription order entry system and by recognizing and appreciating the role of pharmacist in evaluating the prescriptions can substantially reduce these widespread errors.On other side 150 related peoples of health care systems (Doctors, Retailers/Store keepers and Pharmaceutical marketing personals) were interviewed to assess the role of these peoples in the eradications of drug abuse and misuse in our society.It was largely observed that there is lack of concentration, especially doctors and store keepers/retailers in the process of counseling with patients/customers regarding harmful effects of drug abuse and misuse on the health of patients/customers.Our results also found that majority of medical stores / pharmacies have no any criteria for dispensing the all types of medicines, which is contributing to easy availability of drugs and lack of concentration of drug regulating agencies at pharmacies/medical stores.This study will recommend the proposals for eradication of this social evil, which has been affecting the health of considerable portion of population in Hyderabad.The findings of this study will help Government to realize the importance of pharmacist in health care system and formulate the long-lasting strategy/policy to deal with problem of drug abuse and misuse and their contributing factors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Using alcohol or drugs after a period of recovery is called a lapse or a relapse. A lapse refers to the first episode of use, and may or may not lead to a relapse. A relapse refers to continued use of alcohol or drugs after the initial lapse. People with SUDs may lapse or relapse only once, several times, or many times. Although it is possible for anyone to get and stay sober, some people are at greater risk for relapse. It is best to view these people as struggling more than others who do better. Those who relapse are not bad but vulnerable people who have trouble controlling their use.",

Often (but not always) the liquid and its aerosol vapour contain nictorine,; in these cases, the devices are termed electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).– The use of vaping devices is generally described as a smoking cessation aid for use in the short term only,,–; that is, ENDS and other vaping products are neither recommended for people who do not smoke nor for long-term use in people who smoke and are trying to quit.,Nonetheless, the use of ENDS is increasing rapidly across the world,, particularly among adolescents and younger adults.,,,– Whereas the use of ENDS products in adults generally follows their use of combustible tobacco products (i.e., often used as a cessation aid), use of ENDS products in children, youth, and younger adults often begins before the use of combustible tobacco products, causing concern that ENDS and other vaping products may serve as a “gateway” to the use of combustible tobacco products — especially in younger populations.,,,There is currently limited evidence describing the health effects of ENDS and other vaping products — particularly given the wide variety of available ENDS products — including a lack of data describing associated morbidity and mortality. However, a growing body of literature describes the risk of e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury that can be caused by ENDS devices.,– In addition, there is the risk of toxicity and/or adverse reactions that can be caused by the aerosol vapour, particularly in children and youth., Concerns have also been raised about the insufficiency of current regulatory limitations in place in Canada that govern the distribution, marketing, and use of ENDS.Given the rising use of ENDS and other vaping products, as well as the uncertainty concerning their health effects, there is a need for evidence-based guidance to support vaping cessation. The purpose of this report is to identify and describe evidence-based guidelines to inform the use of pharmacological interventions to support vaping cessation.",

Solitary abuse of one single drug, either hashish or opium, is the common feature of drug abuse in Afghanistan. 3. Abuse of other patent drugs as well as multiple drug abuse by the same individual, increasingly common elsewhere, is quite rare. 4. Self-treatment is a major cause of drug abuse in Afghanistan while escape from boredom and lack of work and motivation is another. 5. Hashish as well as opium is commonly abused by people of a low socioeconomical standard. 6. Alcohol, a more recent introduction by the upper class, is becoming popular among city dwellers with major risks involved for the future. 7. Drug abuse in Afghanistan has so far not created problems comparable to those in the West, although there is no guarantee that in future it will not do so. Coercive measures aimed at depriving an individual of his drug of choice may involve the greater risk of drug substitution which will then be an even more difficult problem to manage. 8. Factors involved in prevention as well as cure of the drug-dependent population in Afghanistan have been discussed.",

      "title": "The Harms and Prevention of Drugs and Alcohol on Children",
      "abstract": "Children risk harming themselves when they consume drugs or alcohol, as these psychoactive substances are associated with numerous adverse effects on their physical and psychological health and well-being. Children may also be profoundly affected by the misuse of drugs or alcohol by the people responsible for their care, most often parents. This too can also seriously affect their health and well-being, and all aspects of family life can be severely affected by substance misuse. The potential harms to children are both short and long term, and may have irrevocable consequences, whether these arise from consumption by the children themselves or from the collateral harms caused by their carers’ consumption. The range of psychoactive substances used recreationally is extensive in type and strength and thus in relative potential harm. It includes opioids, cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco. Alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis are the substances most commonly used by both adults and children. Across the world, psychoactive substances other than alcohol and tobacco are widely illegal, although many so-called legal highs (Novel Psychoactive Substances) can be found in countries where legislation has not kept up with the pace of development of novel substances. Moreover, some legally prescribed drugs, such as benzodiazepines, may be used illegally without a prescription. None are without attendant risks. While alcohol and tobacco are widely legal, most countries regulate their production, purchase, and use, in part with a view to protecting children. A minimum age is usually specified for their legal purchase and, for tobacco, many developed countries now ban smoking in all enclosed public spaces to protect both the adults and children around the users. Broadly speaking, around three quarters of adults, outside “dry” countries, consume alcohol, so most children grow up in an environment where alcohol use by parents is normalized. Around a quarter of adults smoke tobacco, so proportionately fewer children are similarly exposed to parental use. Figures for adult use of illicit drugs vary, but around 1% of children probably grow up with parental drug use. This article addresses the use and known harms to children from legal and illegal substances. The readings included provide a selection of the available literature. For the purposes of these readings, “children” is interpreted to address individuals aged up to 18 years of age, including fetuses in utero, and the known effects of alcohol and drugs on this age group. However, the citations used may define “children” in other ways and may include age ranges that extend beyond 18.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness that alcohol and drug abuse and smoking are not only harmful for the consumer but will also, when taken by a pregnant woman, adversely affect her unborn child. The consequence of the abuse will result from a combination of specific toxic effects of abusing substances and a nonspecific effect from the often very unstable environment of an alcohol- or drug-dependent mother. Poor prenatal care is a common finding in alcohol and drug abuse leading to a high incidence of complications during pregnancy and delivery including premature labor and small-for-gestational-age babies. An increased perinatal mortality has been reported following all types of abuse including tobacco use, probably as a consequence of poor prenatal care as well as of a toxic effect on the fetus. Withdrawal symptoms after birth are most prominent in opiate addiction. The already intrauterinely damaged child will if it stays with its parents often continue to be exposed to several abverse environmental factors. However, symptoms such as mental retardation following alcohol abuse and hyperactivity and emotional disturbances following drug exposure during intrauterine life have also been found in children who have been taken from the parents and placed in foster homes immediately after birth. This means that children of abusing parents both in their custody and in foster home will have to be regarded as risk children that should be subjected to careful medical and psychological follow-up.",

Substance abuse and addiction have grave consequences on our existing social systems, effecting crime rates, hospitalizations, child abuse, and child neglect, and are rapidly consuming limited public funds. The intravenous drug abuser represents the fastest growing vector of HIV virus. Addiction is most commonly caused by physical and psychological changes that occur in the body and brain on behalf of drug and alcohol abuse. In today’s age of stress, a fast lifestyle, blatant media consumption and instant gratification, picking up habits like alcoholism and smoking is very easy. However, the addictive nature of these substances is strong, and it is fairly common to become dependent. The difference between substance abuse and addiction is very slight. Substance abuse means using an illegal substance or using a legal substance in the wrong way. Addiction begins as abuse, or using a substance like marijuana or cocaine.

This suggests the possible emergence of a de novo pattern of substance use and suggests the emergence of an unmet treatment need, cessation.

Even when nonfatal, overdoses have a high potential for lasting health consequences. In the United States, the majority of drug overdose deaths are classified as unintentional/accidental. Drug overdoses can involve a variety of substances, ranging from prescription or over-the-counter medications to illicitly-manufactured drugs, and many overdoses involve multiple substances. In the United States, opioids, especially synthetic opioids such as illicitly-manufactured fentanyl, are most commonly involved in overdose deaths, followed by stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine. Drug overdoses disproportionately impact populations experiencing social and/or economic marginalization, and racial disparities in drug overdose are growing in the United States. Overall, drug overdose represents a topic of relevance for social workers engaged in research, policy, clinical, or community practice alike, across medical, behavioral health, legal, social service, educational, and child welfare systems.",

It discusses the relationships between alcohol use and personnel security, the prevalence of alcohol use and abuse, indicators of alcohol dependence and abuse, the relationships of alcohol problems to other forms of problem behavior, and treatment effectiveness and relapse rates. About 10% of adult Americans have a serious alcohol problem. Excessive alcohol consumption may impair judgement and increase the risk of accidental, careless or even deliberate disclosure of classified information. Motivation for using alcohol or any other drug is one of the most potent predictors of future use or problems with that drug. If the motivation is experimentation, peer pressure, or adolescent rebelliousness, this does not necessarily lead to future abuse. To the extent that alcohol is used as a means of coping with life's problems, such as stress or low self-esteem, then one can expect that the alcohol consumption itself may eventually become a source of future problems. Solitary drinking is far more predictive of future problems than social drinking. So is drinking prior to social events(to relax), as compared with alcohol use at social events.",

      "abstract": "Amphetamines are among the most dangerous of currently abused psychoactive drugs. They cause dependence, behavioral toxicity, and physical damage. Despite their extensive medical use, the evidence suggests they are ineffective or minimally effective in most of the conditions for which they are prescribed. Their widespread use in medical practice is more likely the result of the euphoria and the dependence they induce than of any significant clinical results. This paradox, presented by the legality of amphetamine use, compounds the difficulty of treating youthful drug abusers and educating potential abusers. The following recommendations are urged: prescription of these drugs should, with few exceptions, cease; and production should be sharply curtailed and probably be limited to one or two pharmaceutical companies.",

Constipation that is not secondary to underlying disease or caused by factors such as side-effects of drugs or laxative abuse is known as simple constipation. Its causes include insufficient fluid and fibre in the diet, failure to respond to the urge to defaecate, and lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise or mobility, stress, and long-haul air travel. These can often be resolved without recourse to medication, but short-term use of a laxative may be helpful in restoring normal bowel function.",

In all areas of family, vocation, health, and legal difficulties, the alcoholics reported a much higher rate of problems. The alcoholics in high frequencies reported the attractions of drink to be relaxation, forgetting, taste, and mind enhancement; while the controls reported little attraction in any area, but taste most frequently.

Prominent key words for the categories under which respective studies were carried out are \"controlled\" or \"recreational\" drug use and drugs in \"bourgeois milieus\". Socially integrated drug use was defined as weekly cannabis herb and/or resin consumption during the last half year prior to the interview and/or at least monthly consumption of ecstasy and/or cocaine and/or amphetamines during the same time. A large majority of the socially integrated drug users had taken cannabis in the month prior to the interview, herb much than resin. Drug use of socially integrated persons is experimental or temporary; lifetime prevalence therefore is usually higher than current prevalence. General population studies consistently show that many drug users have used more than one illegal drug in their life, and that experimental use is high.",

      "title": "Therapeutic implications of drug 'holidays'",
      "abstract": "While a patient may appear to be fully compliant with respect to quantity of medication ingested, the timing of doses can vary considerably. This may introduce protracted intervals between doses, particularly if dosing frequency is greater than once daily. This commonly presents in the form of drug holidays, where dosing is omitted for 1 or more days, followed by a resumption of full-strength dosing, possibly resulting in excessive drug effects when dosing suddenly resumes, rebound effects when dosing is suddenly stopped and a period without effective drug action. Poor compliance has not only been associated with poorer treatment outcome, but also with financial consequences. It has been suggested that hospitalization due to non-compliance accounts for 11.7% of all healthcare expenditure in the U.S.A. Differences between drugs, in terms of both their concentration-time profiles and their duration of action, will lead to some agents being more effective than others in the face of interruptions in dosage. A drug with an intrinsically long duration of action, such as the calcium antagonist amlodipine, will provide better therapeutic coverage than those with a shorter duration of action and therefore minimize effects generated by an intermittent pattern of dosing.",

      "abstract": "While they do not necessarily present the same health risk, such other problems as compulsive shopping and eating have similarly serious implications for both physical and emotional health. All of these behaviors share a common theme reflecting difficulty with impulse control. In some cases, identifying patients with impulse control problems is straightforward; the pack of cigarettes or nicotine stains are easily visible, or the patient's weight can be measured in the office. Other problems, such as alcohol abuse or compulsive shopping, are less observable. To further compound the difficulty with identification is the fact that physicians may not ask routinely about the existence of such problems. Whether a practitioner inquires about the existence of these or other impulse control problems may be related to the difficulty one faces when the problem is finally identified. Addictive behaviors and impulse control disorders are notoriously difficult to treat. High relapse rates and the frustration of both patient and health care provider when efforts to change fail are a testimonial to the tenacity of these behaviors. Recent research highlighting how to meet patients at their level of readiness to change a risk-related behavior offers a perspective on what clinicians can do to assist their patients in approaching and ultimately changing these behaviors. The stages of change model will be described as a method for conceptualizing how behavior change can be facilitated in patients with these various problems. In addition, issues relevant to making a referral will be discussed.",

Misusing drugs applies to legal substances, such as alcohol, or illegal substances, like cannabis or cocaine. In the popular imagination, people who misuse substances are often seen to be the agents of their own problems and are believed to be ambivalent about changing their behaviour. For many people who are dependent on substances, the greatest harm is not to others, but to themselves. The impact on the body of excessive alcohol includes cirrhosis of the liver, cardiovascular problems, the destruction of brain cells, increased risk of cancer and diabetes, malnutrition, and sexual problems. Many people use substances to enhance pleasurable experiences; others come to rely on them as a mechanism for coping with life’s challenges, often from a young age, and substance use can lend a temporary boost in self-esteem or social confidence. Drug use becomes misuse when someone becomes dependent or the use becomes problematic or harmful to themselves or others. Many people use drugs on a regular basis while maintaining their employment and continuing to effectively parent their children.",

      "abstract": "BAB 1PENDAHULUANA.Latar BelakangNarkoba merupakan singkatan dari Narkotika, Psikotropika dan zat adiktif lainnya BNN (2006). Narkoba pada awalnya digunakan untuk keperluan medis, pemakaiannya akan menjadi aman dan efektif apabila digunakan pada dosis tertentu, bentuk – bentuk tertentu dan juga pada waktu yang tepat. Narkoba menjadi disalahgunakan apabila digunakan untuk tujuan non medis seperti: mabuk, menurunkan berat badan dan menambah massa otot Anonymous (2006). Menurut Joewana dan Martono (2006) dibalik dampak negatifnya, penggunaan narkoba mampu untuk menimbulkan kesenangan dan juga perasaan –perasaan bahagia yang semu. Jika tidak, seseorang tidak akan mengambil resiko yang begitu besar untuk kehilangan pekerjaan, pendidikan, kesehatan dan lingkungan sosialnya. Efek yang ditimbulkan dari pemakaian narkoba adalah: hilangnya rasa kesepian, hilangnya perasaan – perasaan negatif, halusinasi, euforia berlebihan, mampu menggendalikan situasi, terbebas dari kejaran waktu, meningkatkan semangat dan rasa percaya diri. Apabila narkoba dikonsumsi secara terus menerus dan berlebihan maka pemakai akan menjadi bergantung / adiksi pada zat tersebut. Ketergantungan narkoba ini akan menimbulkan efek – efek negatif pada fisik dan juga psikologis jika pemakaiannya dihentikan, contohnya seperti: rasa nyeri pada badan, kejang – kejang, gelisah, sulit tidur, takut air, cemas, mudah tersinggung, melakukan kekerasan dan cenderung untuk bunuh diri Joewana &amp;amp; Martono (2006). Efek yang paling berbahaya dalam penyalahgunaan narkoba adalah menurunnya sistem kekebalan tubuh yang akan meningkatkan kemungkinan terjangkit virus HIV, hepatitis C bahkan sampai menyebabkan kematian (Anonymous, 2005). Pada saat ini penyalahgunaan narkoba pada kalangan remaja Indonesia menunjukan peningkatan. Berdasarkan survei nasional yang dilakukan oleh Badan Narkotika Nasional (BNN) yang berkerja sama dengan Pusat Penelitian Kesehatan Universitas Indonesia, pada tahun 2011 terdapat 2,2 persen atau sekitar 4 juta penduduk Indonesia yang menyalahgunakan narkoba. Dari jumlah tersebut 22 persen atau sekitar 880 ribu orang merupakan remaja yang masih berstatus sebagai pelajar dan mahasiswa(Anonymous, 2013). Dari data survei penyalahgunaan narkoba yang dilakukan BNN dan Universitas Indonesia pada tahun 2011 menyebutkan bahwa lokasi seperti Jawa Barat, Jawa Tengah, Aceh dan Kalimantan tengah angkanya relatif stabil bahkan khusus untuk daerah DKI Jakarta cenderung mengalami peningkatan. Responden yang mengikuti survei ini berimbang antara pria dengan wanita dengan kisaran umur antara 15 tahun sampai dengan 21 tahun yang masih berada dalam kelompok usia remaja. Hasil dari survei ini juga menyebutkan bahwa semakin tinggi tingkat pendidikan dan umur dari responden maka semakin tinggi juga penyalahgunaan terhadap narkoba. Angka penyalahgunaan lebih tinggi di kota dibandingkan dengan kabupaten dan lebih tinggi juga pada sekolah / perguruan tinggi swasta dibandingkan dengan yang lainnya (Nugroho, 2012). B.

      "abstract": "Cocaine is a powerful euphoriant and it relieves, though only transiently, depression, dread and dysphoria. New patterns of cocaine abuse, such as the inhalation of vaporized cocaine base, the intravenous injection of cocaine hydrochloride and the smoking of coca paste, produce a brief elation that quickly gives way either to a return to the baseline mood or to displeasure, resulting in a strong desire to return to the momentary ecstatic experience, a cycle that leads to compulsive use. The enormous profits made from illicit traffic in cocaine lead to corruption, violence and political destabilization. The individual costs of cocaine abuse include loss of personal fortunes, jobs and families. The safety of cocaine use is a myth. There are a number of ways in which cocaine can be lethal. The high doses of cocaine abused today induce physical dependence, but this is less a contributory factor than the intense psychological craving to perpetuate cocaine use. There is no specific way to treat dysfunctional cocaine use; instead the treatment plan must deal with the individual's specific situation. Except for a reduction of cocaine supply at the source, preventive measures are only feasible in the context of abstinence from all abusable drugs.",

      "abstract": "Regular consumers of caffeine had higher muscle tension after three or more hours of abstinence than low caffeine consumers. This difference was absent after double-blind administration of caffeine citrate or placebo. In a discriminative reaction time test, caffeine treatment improved performance. Among subjects receiving placebo, anxiety was highly correlated with prior caffeine use, suggesting that even a brief abstinence may produce anxiety in the regular user.",

      "title": "Alcoholic abstinence in elderly subjects with misuse of alcohol",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder does not disappear with aging, neither the associated induced-suffering. While the prevalence of alcohol use disorder still remains around 10% in the subjects over 65 year old age, and daily encountered by hospital or nursing-home caregivers. Alcohol misuse is often overlooked in elderly people, which then obtain lesser care than younger adults although the care prognosis remains as good as or better than before the age of 65, alcoholic abstinence gets always a place among care offers to elders suffering of alcohol use disorders and dependence. However abstinence is a complex notion gathering various representations or meanings, and induces necessary psychological changes. Alcoholic abstinence seems thus to be feared by families or caregivers, because of lack of knowledge about the addictive dimension of the disorder. On behalf of ultimate freedom, and allowing a last pleasure, alcohol use disorders and its associated suffering can be neglected because abstinence is considered as aggressive and harmful. However, modalities of reduction of alcohol consumption as well as access control or regulated supply of alcoholic beverages, keep having a place in graduate care offers. Beyond the choice of decreasing or suppress drinking alcohol beverages, which only are terms or conditions of improvement, the main point remains the improvement of well-fare, quality of life and elders' health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND This brief discusses the signs and symptoms of alcohol and drug use and provides recommendations to assess substance use among youth in your program. It is not uncommon for adolescents to experiment with different substances such as alcohol or cigarettes, but this can lead to heavy and continued use, which is dangerous and may put their health at risk. Additionally, individuals who drink and smoke are more likely to participate in other risky behaviors, including using other drugs or driving after drinking. Adolescents may turn to substance use when they are under stress at home or at school, or when their friends are smoking or drinking. TOBACCO USE Tobacco can be used in the form of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or smokeless tobacco. Using tobacco at a young age increases the risk of addiction and later health problems. E About one-quarter of high school students reported having smoked a cigarette before the age of 13, and more than one-third of high school students reported smoking cigarettes in the past 30 days. 1 E Tobacco use has been associated with many health problems, including heart disease and cancer, 2 and is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. 3",

The images are sometimes stark and sad, but distant: groups of young men, hanging out on the corner in poorer sections of the city, selling bags of cocaine or heroin to all comers, rich and poor, brown, black, and white, male and female, most young but some not so young. Or the unkempt man of indeterminate age who panhandles to buy cheap alcohol and then sleeps off the effects huddled in a doorway off the street. Other images may come closer to home: youngsters who gather for all-night parties, dancing, taking drugs, and getting high with their friends; high school students who smoke marijuana every day before gym class; the popular, hard-working neighbor who drinks a six-pack of beer every night, or two martinis and three glasses of wine, and goes to bed as drunk as the homeless man on the street. Or the friend, brother, or spouse who has tried for years to stop smoking but has consistently failed. What these people have in common is that, to a greater or lesser extent, their behavior is controlled by a chemical substance.",

      "title": "THE PSYCHODYNAMICS OF THE \"DRY DRUNK\"",
      "abstract": "Our study of the responses of the 52 respondents to the questionnaire on the dry drunk leads us to the following conclusions: 1. The dry drunk is experienced by the majority of alcoholics who have maintained sobriety over a long period. 2. The occupation of an alcoholic has no statistical significance in maintaining sobriety. 3. A number of alcoholics will drink from 10 to 20 years before they begin to maintain sobriety. 4. Dry drunks generally occur within the first year of sobriety ( occasionally during the early months). 5. This symptom occurs irregularly and with diminishing intensity as the period of sobriety lengthens. 6. The dry drunk is characterized by a feeling of deep depression and frustration and by indecision regarding taking a drink. 7. \"Inner life\" is largely responsible for precipitating a dry drunk. 8. The dry drunk often is preceded by the same feelings. 9. The principal feelings after a dry drunk are relief and thankfulness at not drinking during this period of craving. 10. Drugs are not used to combat the moods and feelings of a dry drunk nor to produce similar feelings. 11. Alcoholics are irritable, restless, and impatient during a dry drunk. 12. After a dry drunk one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior return to normal. 13. A. A. members are the persons most helpful during a dry drunk while spouses, other members of the family, and former drinking companions are the least helpful. 14. Dry drunks may be prevented by contacts with A. A. and efforts to keep the mind off the drinking problem. 15. Dry drunks are generally related to one's mood swings 16. The financial status generally improves when sobriety is maintained over an extended period. 17. The dry drunks described by our respondents have a number of the same characteristics as the \" late withdrawal symptoms\" described by Wellman. We feel that this study has been useful in clarifying our thinking on the dry drunk, in indicating sources of help for persons who are experiencing or may suffer dry drunks, and in pointing out areas for further study. We are impressed with the thoughtful, painstaking way in which the questionnaires were answered and with the willingness of the respondents to elaborate in detail on their experiences.",

      "title": "Diet and drug interactions",
      "abstract": "When we learn from a patient, clinician, or medical record that a drug has been discontinued, it is logical to ask why. The drug may no longer be needed; it may not have produced the desired effect; it may have produced an adverse reaction; a better drug may be available to replace the original drug. The patient may have discontinued the drug because he or she could not see why it was necessary; or the patient may have discontinued the drug because of unpleasant side effects. A drug may not work because its absorption is reduced by physical or chemical interaction with another drug or a food component. It may also not work because the patient's metabolism is speeded up or in hibited to an extent such that the desired duration of drug action is not obtained. Such an effect may be related to a change in diet. Side effects may be related to consumption of specific foods or bev erages or to an overall change in nutritional status. Drug-food and drug-alcohol incompatibility reactions are frequent but are avoidable if a patient is warned of their possible occurrence. Drugs may also produce nutritional deficiencies, especially in a patient whose diet is marginal in those nutrients depleted by the particular drug. Careful prescribing practices together with appropriate nutrient supplements will serve to reduce the risk of these incompatibilities.",

Presentation of an aversive conditioned stimulus suppressed drug seeking in rats with limited cocaine self-administration experience, but no longer did so after an extended cocaine-taking history. In contrast, after equivalent extended sucrose experience, sucrose seeking was still suppressed by an aversive conditioned stimulus. Persistent cocaine seeking in the presence of signals of environmental adversity after a prolonged cocaine-taking history was not due to impaired fear conditioning, nor to an increase in the incentive value of cocaine, and may reflect the establishment of compulsive behavior.",

Life threatening oral habits can be either tobacco involving habits or non-tobacco involving habits. Most of the life-threatening diseases occurring due to oral habits have aetiology of tobacco usage with few instances of non-tobacco induced. Tobacco whether consumed as smoked form or smokeless form, affects the human body in one way or the other. These habits developed by the body can be peer pressure induced, stress induced, can be due to social stigma or can even be a habit that once started as an adventure has now converted into a compulsion. Favourably there are various therapies available for managing tobacco abuse that can ultimately curb the deadly situation arising after tobacco use, hence decreasing the rate of occurrence of various preventable diseases as well as increasing the life expectancy of the masses. This review article focuses on the various tobacco and non-tobacco induced oral habits that can be life threatening for the human body, consequences of these habits, their treatment and management.",

Factors affecting consumptionConsumption of alcohol depends on several variables.Sex-Although men are twice as likely to have alcohol related problems, the gap between the sexes is narrowing.Occupation-Alcohol misuse is more common in jobs related to catering, brewing, and distilling.In others, such as doctors, sailors, and demolition workers, high consumption is perceived as the social norm.Homelessness-About a third of homeless people have alcohol problems.Race-British Afro-Caribbeans and south Asians have lower average consumption and lower hospital admission rates for alcohol related problems than white people.However, pockets of high consumption exist, as has been reported among Sikh men (particularly of spirits).About a fifth of Chinese and Japanese people cannot drink alcohol because of an inherited lack of the liver enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.",

      "title": "Health aspects of cannabis: revisited",
      "abstract": "Literature pertaining to the effects of cannabis use and health which has been published during the past 11 years has been reviewed. Many older concerns about adverse effects on health (chromosomal damage, 'cannabinol psychosis', endocrine abnormalities, cardiac events, impaired immunity) no longer seem to elicit much interest. Continuing concerns about the adverse cognitive effects of chronic use indicate that these can be demonstrated by proper testing; some studies suggest that they may be long-lasting. Although cannabis does not produce a specific psychosis, the possibility exists that it may exacerbate schizophrenia in persons predisposed to that disorder. However, evidence from retrospective surveys must always be questioned. Tolerance and dependence have occurred in man, confirming previous findings in many other species. Addiction tends to be mild and is probably less severe than with other social drugs. Driving under the influence of cannabis is impaired acutely; how long such impairments last is still unknown. More exacting tasks, such as flying an airplane, may be impaired for as long as 24 hours. While there is no doubt that marijuana smoke contains carcinogens, an increase in cancer among users has thus far been anecdotal. Because of the long latent period between cancer induction and initiation of cigarette smoking, the full story is yet to be told. Marijuana use during pregnancy is not advised although the consequences are usually not greater than those of smoking cigarettes, and far less than those from alcohol use. Whether smoked marijuana should become a therapeutic agent requires a cost-benefit analysis of the potential benefits versus the adverse effects of such use as we now know them.",

TreatmentDespite the availability of effective treatments, few people with bulimia nervosa seek help.One study found that only 1 in 10 people with the condition are in treatment. 1 Treatments that are likely to workAntidepressants Antidepressants can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.There is not enough evidence on how long the benefits last or for comparing the effects of different classes of antidepressants.Antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy are equally effective for bulimia nervosa, though dropout rates are higher with antidepressants, probably due to their side effects.For information on drug doses, see www.besttreatments.org/bulimianervosa. Cognitive behaviour therapyAs with antidepressants, cognitive behaviour therapy can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.It may be preferable to medication in patients who are sensitive to, or wish to avoid, side effects of medication.Cognitive behaviour therapy and other psychological treatments seem to be equally good at treating binge eating, although cognitive behaviour therapy is better at improving depression scores.There is some evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy has long term benefits in treating bulimia, but there is insufficient evidence about patients' characteristics that predict response.",

In both conditions, a non-deprived baseline was followed by performance tests 2, 6 and 24 h later, while subjective feelings were assessed every 2 h. Compared to normal smoking, abstinence led to reduced heart rate, worse task performance, feelings of depression, stress, irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, and urges to smoke. Letter cancellation and number vigilance task performance were significantly poorer after 2 and 6 h of abstinence. Subjective feeling states were significantly worse after 4 h of abstinence, and became increasingly impaired over the rest of the day. However many abstinence symptoms (except heart rate), were reduced in severity at the 24-h session, held on the morning of the following day. This suggests that many of the psychological effects of smoking abstinence, may build-up afresh each day.",

The development of chronic tolerance to ethanol leads to greater and greater intake of ethanol, subsequent tissue damage, increased likelihood of more severe dependence, and the possibility of life-threatening withdrawal. The development of tolerance in the short term may encourage individuals to drink more per occasion in an attempt to recover or maintain the “glow” of the effects of alcohol experienced after the first drink. Whether or not this is important to the development of alcoholism is a matter of debate, but the existence of this acute tolerance has been known for many years. The mechanistic relationship of this acute tolerance to the chronic tolerance seen after weeks, months, or years of drinking remains to be elucidated.",

      "abstract": "Use of the electronic cigarette or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) is increasing globally. Its vapour delivers nicotine without the 6000 odd chemicals released during cigarette smoking and the associated harm. Experts are divided on whether ENDS promise reduction in tobacco use or threaten tobacco control. This review presents up-to-date evidence. Two trials showed an increase in cessation, but not a reduction in cigarette use. Eight cohort studies showed no increase in cessation, and two cohort studies and a recent trial showed an increased reduction in cigarette use. A US population study showed association between ENDS use and smoking cessation. Nicotine addiction and potential harm to non-smokers who use ENDS are key concerns. Nicotine affects lung and brain development. An increase in accidental poisoning, though mild, is reported in children. No significant short term health effects are reported. When heated, ENDS may emit potential toxic and carcinogenic substances such as aldehydes, acrolein, flavouring agents etc. at very low levels - but their long term impact is not known. ENDS bring potential benefits to smokers, but there are concerns about their potential for nicotine addiction, gateway effect and renormalisation of smoking. However, in the UK and the US, a rise in ENDS use is associated with a fall in the prevalence of smoking. Countries differ in their approach to ENDS. India seems to be edging towards a total ban. India should collect local data and conduct research to monitor the impact and make informed, evidence based decisions, where needed.",

Si en la infancia un individuo usa productos que contienen nicotina, será más fuerte su adicción y más difícil dejar de fumar. Independientemente de la presencia o ausencia de nicotina, la exposición al aerosol de e-cig en la niñez, adolescencia y edad adulta temprana no está exenta de riesgos y puede provocar toxicidad pulmonar.

      "abstract": "Research shows that problem behaviors manifested early tend to persist into later life. Problem drinking does not necessarily commit the young adolescent to a life course of this behavior, but it does alter the probabilities. Conversely, early abstinence is a strong predictor of later healthful behavior. An important observation is that alcohol and other drug use tends to decrease along with smoking decreases. Young adolescents tend to believe that most of their peers engage in a particular type of behavior whether that is the actual case or not. There is a tendency across populations of adolescents to overestimate such behaviors by a factor of six or eight. In one study, school children estimated that about two-thirds of their peers smoked while the actual figure was about one-tenth. Adolescents tend to have weak orientation to the future, especially in regard to consequences of risk-taking behavior. College-bound adolescents tend to have a longer view of the future than those who do not pursue college, but in general adolescents think, \"It can't happen to me,\" or, \"It's so far off that I just can't think about it.\" They are focused on the here and now. Many youngsters when they think about it have a dismal view of the future. They are doubtful about their own ability to influence events in ways that build toward a rewarding life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Among populations involved in drug abuse and predatory crime, a temporal sequence from drug abuse to predatory criminality is not typical; on the contrary, predatory criminality more commonly occurs before drug abuse. Drug-abusing offenders who display increasingly deviant behavior over time may eventually cross over a threshold to heroin addiction or frequent polydrug abuse. The intensity of their criminal behavior typically escalates substantially. If these high-rate offenders subsequently decrease the amount of drugs they use, they typically also lessen their rate of criminal activity. Among offenders who use multiple types of drugs, individual predatory crime commission frequencies are typically two or three times higher among offenders when they use multiple types of drugs than they are for the same offenders when they are in drug treatment or abstain from drug abuse.",

Elderly patients are particularly at risk because more than 30% of all the prescription drugs are taken by this population. Failure to identify and properly manage drug-nutrient interactions can lead to serious consequences. For instance, drug-nutrient interactions can result in reduced absorption of certain oral antibiotics and may lead to suboptimal antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection. This predisposes the patient to treatment failure. Induction or inhibition of enzymes in the gut by nutrients may lead to a significant change in oral bioavailability of drugs or vice versa. For example, grapefruit juice is a selective intestinal CYP3A4 inhibitor. The overall exposure of some drugs can be increased by more than fivefold when taken with grapefruit juice and increase the risk of adverse effects. The use of certain drugs may affect GI tract function and may lead to a loss of bodily electrolytes and fluid. Limiting drug prescriptions to essential medications for as short a period as possible and periodic re-evaluations of the treatment chosen are essential to minimize adverse drug-nutrient interactions.",

Through the effects of environmental smoke or smoking during pregnancy, adolescent smokers affect not only their own health, but that of friends, family members, and even their own fetuses and children.

Several background and demographic characteristics are correlated with drug use; higher rates of use are found among males, older students, and students who frequently miss classes. No correlation is observed between drug use and class standing, sibling position, social relationships, or family drug use patterns. Tobacco use was found to be low among these medical students but was highly correlated with nonmedical drug use. Drug use patterns appear to have developed in high school and college, and to persist, albeit at a diminished rate, during medical school. The findings provide little support for the belief that marijuana or cocaine use substitutes for alcohol use; higher consumption of virtually any recreational drug is predictive of higher use of other recreational drugs.",

      "abstract": "Risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD) is more common in late adolescence and early adulthood (approximately between the ages of 16 and 30) than in any other period in life. This is also the age when young people in Switzerland and many other European countries are legally allowed to buy and drink alcohol, but they usually do not yet have adult responsibilities. This paper reviews evidence from the international literature and provides examples of studies conducted in Switzerland demonstrating that (a) RSOD is by far most prevalent on Saturday evenings followed by Friday evenings, usually because young people go out and do not have any work or study responsibilities the next day; (b) RSOD results from drinking in private before going out (\"predrinking\") and accelerating the pace of drinking (i.e. increasing the number of drinks consumed per hour); (c) RSOD is often not accidental but purposeful,. to seek excitement, to have fun and to feel the effects of alcohol; (d) RSOD occurs predominantly outside the home, mostly in bars, pubs, discos or at special events and festivals; (e) RSOD often results in intended and unintended injuries and other acute consequences, which are leading risk factors for mortality and morbidity in this age group. Effective prevention strategies should include attempts to reduce opportunities to engage in heavy drinking as well as strategies to reduce its harmful consequences.",

Dies kann eine relevante Gefährdung im Straßenverkehr zur Folge haben. Eine Gefahr besteht insbesondere bei gleichzeitigem Konsum von Alkohol, was die Cannabiswirkung erheblich verstärkt. Nach chronischem Konsum werden signifikant häufiger psychotische Störungen manifest, und es besteht die Gefahr der Entwicklung einer psychischen und körperlichen Abhängigkeit. Jugendliches Alter und vorbestehende psychische Störungen erhöhen das Risiko für diese unerwünschten Wirkungen. Das chronische Rauchen von Marihuana ist mit einer erhöhten Toxizität für den Respirationstrakt und einem erhöhten Krebsrisiko verbunden. Es gibt Hinweise auf eine Störung des Immunsystems sowie auf teratogene Effekte durch chronischen Cannabiskonsum.",

TreatmentDespite the availability of effective treatments, few people with bulimia nervosa seek help.One study found that only 1 in 10 people with the condition are in treatment. 1 Treatments that are likely to workAntidepressants Antidepressants can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.There is not enough evidence on how long the benefits last or for comparing the effects of different classes of antidepressants.Antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy are equally effective for bulimia nervosa, though dropout rates are higher with antidepressants, probably due to their side effects.For information on drug doses, see www.besttreatments.org/bulimianervosa. Cognitive behaviour therapyAs with antidepressants, cognitive behaviour therapy can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.It may be preferable to medication in patients who are sensitive to, or wish to avoid, side effects of medication.Cognitive behaviour therapy and other psychological treatments seem to be equally good at treating binge eating, although cognitive behaviour therapy is better at improving depression scores.There is some evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy has long term benefits in treating bulimia, but there is insufficient evidence about patients' characteristics that predict response.",

      "abstract": "The long-term use of smokeless tobacco has led to severe health consequences in countries like India, Pakistan and Sudan, whereas the products used in Scandinavia and USA are less hazardous. Both the type of product and the general health of the population determine the outcome. All tobacco products contain carcinogenic substances and substantial quantities of nicotine. Nicotine has, apart from its psychoactive properties, abundant vasoregulatory effects through the mediation of cholinergic as well as adrenergic stimuli. Studies of the effects of snuff or snus use in developed countries have shown a moderate risk for cancer, cardiovascular mortality and metabolic diseases, such as type II diabetes. Also, snus use during pregnancy has been found to be a health risk for the newborn baby. The evidence, therefore, suggests that although snuff and snus are less hazardous than smoked tobacco, the most deadly of all consumer products, there is indeed reason to be cautious about the use of smokeless tobacco.",

Other health problems may be tied only indirectly to administration of a particular drug, but may be more related to the process of drug-taking, to the environment where drug-taking is likely to occur, to the behavior related to obtaining and taking drugs, or to the fact that chronic drug abusers are less likely than others to seek medical attention.",

A review of the factors that influence compliance with smoking cessation methods may therefore suggest considerations relevant for the treatment of asthma. Many factors influence whether a smoker will decide to seek help and thus become a patient. However, once this hurdle is overcome a different set of factors influence compliance and whether the treatment is successful. Most successful quitters use individual methods rather than organized smoking cessation programmes. The most important predictive factors for whether a smoker will be successful in quitting smoking are socioeconomic rather than disease specific and this is the case whether health support services are available or not. Smokers who use nicotine replacement products are approximately twice as likely to be successful in quitting than nonusers. While the rate of nicotine absorption from these products is important, it is not the primary predictor of successful quitting. Other important factors include: self-control of nicotine dose, the skills required to use the product, and the side-effects. However, the relative importance of these factors is not well understood. An individual's perception of the appropriateness of a particular treatment and which treatment they think that they will prefer are also important in successful smoking cessation.",

A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance affects the activity of a drug, i.e. the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce a new effect that neither produces on its own. These interactions may occur out of accidental misuse or due to lack of knowledge about the active ingredients involved in the relevant substances. Regarding food-drug interactions physicians and pharmacists recognize that some foods and drugs, when taken simultaneously, can alter the body's ability to utilize a particular food or drug, or cause serious side effects. Clinically significant drug interactions, which pose potential harm to the patient, may result from changes in pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic properties. Some may be taken advantage of, to the benefit of patients, but more commonly drug interactions result in adverse drug events. Therefore it is advisable for patients to follow the physician and doctors instructions to obtain maximum benefits with least food-drug interactions. The literature survey was conducted by extracting data from different review and original articles on general or specific drug interactions with food. This review gives information about various interactions between different foods and drugs and will help physicians and pharmacists prescribe drugs cautiously with only suitable food supplement to get maximum benefit for the patient.",

Yet, despite the many successes of a burgeoning parents' movement, stimulated by the active leadership and support of the President and Mrs Reagan, drug use persists as a significant threat to the health and well-being of American youth. Physicians are in a powerful position to deliver health promotion messages to patients and their parents and have an obligation to do so whenever possible. Messages delivered on a routine basis can be influential in promoting smoking, alcohol, and drug abstinence. These messages should begin early and continue throughout childhood to reinforce and strengthen the development of healthy attitudes and behaviors. The pediatrician must never be reluctant to express his or her own views regarding the health consequences of drug and alcohol use to patients or their parents. Informed pediatricians represent formidable opposition to individuals who argue that \"experimental\" or \"recreational\" use of illicit substances during the developmental years is inevitable, normal, or harmless.",

      "title": "Alcohol use and preventing alcohol-related problems among young adults in the military",
      "abstract": "Heavy alcohol use is a significant problem in the military. Personnel often use alcohol in an attempt to cope with stress, boredom, loneliness, and the lack of other recreational activities. The easy availability of alcohol, ritualized drinking opportunities, and inconsistent policies contribute to a work culture that facilitates heavy and binge drinking in this population. Prevention strategies such as alcohol use policies combined with campaigns focusing on alcohol deglamorization, personal responsibility, and health promotion currently are being implemented to help reduce heavy alcohol use, but further research is needed to evaluate the effects of these efforts. Understanding the characteristics of military culture that encourage or allow heavy and binge drinking practices also will help in designing effective prevention approaches. KEY WORDS: military; military personnel; young adult; heavy drinking; binge drinking; causes of AODU (alcohol and other drug use); AODU susceptibility; work-related AOD issue; cultural patterns of drinking; AOD availability; workplace-based prevention; prevention of problematic AODU; targeted prevention; prevention campaign; alcoholic beverage distribution laws; expectancy; personal responsibility; health promotion ********** Relative to other substance use, heavy drinking (i.e., consuming five or more drinks per typical drinking occasion at least once a week) appears to be a particularly persistent problem in the military. Although illicit drug use and cigarette smoking both decreased significantly over the period from 1980 to 2002, heavy alcohol use did not show the same decline. In fact, heavy alcohol use increased significantly from 1998 to 2002 for the first time since 1988 (Bray et al. 2003). In 2002, 27 percent of young adults (i.e., 18- to 25-year-olds) in the military reported heavy drinking, compared with only 8.9 percent of 26- to 55-year-olds (Bray et al. 2003). Heavy drinking also is prevalent among those entering the military. A study tracking high school students into adulthood found that those who entered the military were more likely than other young adults to have been heavy drinkers in high school (Bachman et al. 1999). When controlling for marital status, living arrangements, pregnancy, and parenthood, military service itself seemed to contribute to the increases in drinking. A study of young adults entering the U.S. Navy in 1998 examined the degree to which their drinking patterns changed from pre-entry through the first 3 years of service (Ames et al. 2004). Before entering the military, approximately 26 percent of recruits (average age 19) reported frequent heavy drinking (i.e., consuming at least five drinks [for men] and at least four drinks [for women] per typical drinking occasion at least once a week throughout the previous year) (Ames et al. 2002a). At followup 2 years later, the overall prevalence of frequent heavy drinking (23 percent) within the study's cohort remained largely unchanged (Ames et al. 2004). The study found that 2 years into their military enlistment, heavy drinkers could be classified in near-equal numbers as (1) those who were pre-enlistment heavy drinkers and continued the same drinking pattern, and (2) those who were not pre-enlistment heavy drinkers but began heavy drinking after completing their training (Ames et al. 2004). These findings suggest that young adults in the military are at risk for alcohol-related problems, making them important candidates for alcohol-related prevention programs. This article reviews the prevalence of alcohol use among young adults in all four branches of the military, comparing their drinking rates with those of young adult civilians, whether or not they are enrolled full-time in college. Risk factors for heavy drinking among young adults in the military are discussed, along with strategies for reducing hazardous drinking among these young people. RATES OF ALCOHOL USE AMONG YOUNG MILITARY PERSONNEL Rates of heavy alcohol use among 18- to 25-year-old military personnel differ significantly by service branch and by gender, as shown in the accompanying table. …",

Snake venom addiction is one such shocking practice that is witnessed throughout the world; however, it is underreported and not frequently talked about. We report one such case from rural central India where a 28-year-old male snake charmer by occupation presented to the emergency department following intoxication with alcohol and snake venom orally. Upon investigation, it turned out to be a case of snake venom addiction which was started by the patient in order to decrease his alcohol addiction through snake bites initially followed by practice of snake venom ingestion.",

      "title": "Addiction: Rational and Otherwise",
      "abstract": "Addiction is a slippery, hard-to-define concept. The one element of addiction that is commonly agreed upon is that addiction involves “reinforcement”: consumption of the addictive good or activity today increases the desire to consume the good in the future. By this reckoning alone, caffeine, cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, opiates, gambling, sex, exercise, chess, listening to music, watching television, playing video games, eBay, eating Chinese food, reading, and religious observance are addictive for many people. Public policy responds mainly to those potentially addictive substances or behaviors that tend to bring on severe adverse effects: whereas some people read too much, the negative consequences of “readaholism” are insufficiently widespread or dangerous to make book addiction a pressing social concern. But the detrimental effects arising from excessive indulgence in alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and gambling, among other vices, foster efforts at social (and sometimes governmental) influence or control.",

O tabagismo constitui um problema de Saude Publica, que e capaz de gerar impacto. Compoem a fumaca produzida pelos cigarros cerca de 4.700 substâncias prejudiciais a saude. Os componentes misturados presentes nos cigarros incluem metais pesados, acidos e solventes orgânicos, entre outros, que produzem fumaca que quando inalada pode levar a problemas de saude. No cigarro existe a presenca da nicotina, alcatrao, do plutonio, monoxido de carbono, nitrosaminas, cadmio, arsenio, o cianeto de hidrogenio e os policiclicos. A dependencia quimica pelo consumo dos cigarros provem da nicotina, que e uma droga psicoativa. A nicotina constitui o principal empecilho da pratica do tabagismo, uma vez que a mesma provoca muitos problemas, incluindo alguns em âmbito odontologico, tais como: adesao aos dentes e capacidade de adentrar na cavidade bucal nos tecidos moles. O tabagismo pode promover manifestacoes sistemicas e bucais indesejaveis. A nivel odontologico pode ocorrer maior acumulo de biofilme dentario; câncer bucal; halitose; decrescimo na resposta imunologica e inflamatoria; imunossupressao; doencas periodontais; maior profundidade em bolsas periodontais; recessao gengival; perda de insercao periodontal; perdas dentarias; reabsorcao do rebordo alveolar; perda ossea alveolar aumentada; hipossalivacao; restauracoes dentarias e proteses dentarias pigmentadas e manchamento em lingua, dentes e na mucosa em decorrencia. O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar como o tabagismo pode afligir a saude oral dos usuarios. Realizou-se estudo de revisao bibliografica com levantamento nas bases de dados: PubMED, Google Academico envolvendo busca por estudos e artigos que versavam acerca das implicacoes odontologicas ocasionadas pelo tabagismo. O tabagismo deve ser abandonado e para promover auxilio e orientacoes aos tabagistas todo profissional de saude contactante, incluindo o cirurgiao dentista deve alertar esses pacientes sobre os possiveis maleficios sistemicos que podem ser ocasionados pela droga. O cirurgiao dentista pode enfatizar tambem danos que podem ser gerados a saude bucal. A cessacao do consumo dos cigarros auxilia na melhora da qualidade de vida e promove melhora no estado de saude sistemica e bucal apresentado.",

      "title": "Alcohol, still the forgotten drug",
      "abstract": "I was interested to read the paper by Staiger and colleagues 1. Although we persist in referring to drug and alcohol problems by reference to single substances, this can be misleading. It is now more than 10 years since I wrote an editorial in this journal about something that has long been known by all who work with people with substance use disorders: ‘Few drug takers confine themselves to using a single substance. Cigarettes and alcohol often go together. Heroin users may also take drugs such as cocaine and benzodiazepines, and heavy drinkers often also use illicit drugs. Virtually all heroin addicts are also cigarette smokers’ 2. The point of my editorial was that although the reality of multiple substance use is well known, it is seldom given the attention that it deserves. The reasons for this are many. Not the least of these is that matters become complicated when multiple substances are considered. For instance, if someone regularly uses two (or more) drugs, do they have one or two (or more) drug problems? If they are dependent upon two (or more drugs), do they have a more severe dependence problem than if they took only one drug? Is severity of dependence upon each drug additive? Or interactive? Or synergistic? ‘Our favourite drug’, alcohol, is widely used and widely misused. Within the extended menu of substances used by drug takers, alcohol has a special place and deserves greater attention than it generally receives. Staiger et al. draw our attention back to the misuse of alcohol by drug addicts and to the dearth of studies about how alcohol misuse may interact with other drug problems. Heavy drinking among patients in methadone programmes has been recognized as a problem since such programmes were established 3. Heavy drinking among drug misusers is also associated with serious health risks. Hepatitis C infection is common among injection drug users (IDUs), and infected people who drink heavily are at greatly increased risk of serious liver disease. Drug overdose is one of the most frequent causes of death among drug misusers, and heavy drinking among opiate misusers greatly increases the risk of overdose: many so-called heroin overdoses should be attributed more accurately to the combined use of alcohol with opiates 4. Heavy drinking was relatively common among dependent heroin users in the National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS): approximately a quarter were drinking heavily at treatment intake, and the same proportion continued to drink heavily throughout the 5-year follow-up 5. Although some problematic drinkers reduced their frequency and quantity of drinking, many made little change in their drinking behaviour; even with the reductions in quantity of alcohol among the problematic drinkers, typical daily amounts of alcohol at follow-up were between 10 and 19 units (approximately half a bottle of spirits) 6. The interrelationship between drinking and drug use remains poorly understood. Staiger et al. report several studies showing that alcohol use increases relapse to drug use. Our own research suggested that changes in heroin use and drinking outcomes may be largely independent, although heroin misusers who had poor drinking outcomes were more likely to also be using cocaine, amphetamines and benzodiazepines 6. One interesting but little-discussed aspect of the substance use behaviours of drug addicts is that although many are heavy drinkers, a relatively high proportion are abstinent from alcohol. More than a third of the NTORS sample had not used alcohol at all during the 3 months before treatment, and the proportion who were alcohol-abstainers remained constant throughout the 5-year study 5. This abstinence rate is much higher than for the general population. It is not only the drinking behaviour of heroin addicts that is neglected. There is surprisingly little interest in the broader issue of multiple substance misuse. Although there are problems with a substance-specific approach to drug use disorders, it is important to remember that different drugs have different attractions for different users. For example, the relatively high rates of alcohol abstinence among heroin addicts may not be found among other groups of drug misusers. A common pattern of multiple substance misuse involves the concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol. The combined use of alcohol and cocaine produces increased and prolonged euphoria compared to either substance on its own 7, and for some cocaine users the concurrent use of alcohol is an integral part of their pattern of drug-taking. This effect may also be influenced by the type of cocaine being used. Cocaine powder users report more frequent heavy drinking than crack users, and whereas cocaine powder users tended to use cocaine and alcohol concurrently, crack users tended to use alcohol at the end of crack-using sessions 8, 9. Drug users with concurrent polydrug use problems may require special consideration and treatment planning. Alcohol use and, in particular, excessive drinking, is often neglected in the treatment of drug users. Drug users and clinical staff may focus either deliberately or unintentionally upon what is perceived to be the main illicit problem drug and under-rate the use of other substances. The extent and severity of heavy drinking among drug misusers points to the need to develop programmes and interventions that are designed specifically to tackle alcohol-related problems in this client group.

      "title": "CHAPTER 1. Exposure to Lead and Cognitive Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Lead's neurotoxicity has been recognized for centuries. In spite of this knowledge, in the twentieth century, lead-based products— from gasoline to paint to other consumer products—pervaded the consumer and industrial landscape. The upshot was a dramatic increase in humans’ exposures to lead. In the United States, powerful commercial interests, abetted by willing or negligent government officials, overwhelmed the protests of public health advocates, who warned about the harm caused by lead exposure. Thus the removal of lead from these products occurred very slowly. By the 1990s, when lead had been removed from most consumer gasoline and paint, many individuals had experienced protracted exposures, some over the entire course of their lives. The cognitive impairment resulting from high-dose occupational exposure is well-established, and exposure at much lower doses in children can impair their intellectual development. Yet accumulating evidence indicates that long-term exposures at low doses and/or past exposures (that have since ended) may have effects that reverberate in the cognition of older age. Moreover, although lead exposures have declined in many parts of the world, pockets of exposure remain. These continued exposures and an aging global population mean that it is critical to continue to reduce exposures and better understand, and mitigate, the effects of lead exposure on cognitive aging. In this chapter, we review the critical events that resulted in widespread exposures to lead, the mechanisms underlying lead's deleterious effects on cognition, and findings from research on cumulative lead exposure and cognitive function in older age.",

      "title": "Sickness absence as an alcohol‐related problem",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use is related to sickness absence in two somewhat different ways. First, chronic heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of a large number of somatic or psychiatric illnesses, and through these illnesses continued heavy drinking may lead to sickness absence. Secondly, episodic heavy drinking and intoxication may lead to accidents, or to plain hangover, or to continuing drinking bouts which may be the grounds for sickness absence [1]. Alcoholic beverages can be used in many different ways. They can, for instance, be used as intoxicants, as beverages with meals, as thirst quenchers, as a means to celebrate several kinds of festive occasions or as a social lubricant in different situations. Different alcoholic beverages suit these different uses. Depending on the most important functions accorded to alcohol, drinking habits will vary across cultures. All alcoholic drinks, and especially wine, are used in many countries as a beverage with meals. When wine is used commonly with meals, per capita alcohol consumption is quite high. However, drinking with meals means that alcohol use is spread over many or all days of the week and the amount of alcohol consumed at one sitting usually stays reasonably low. Therefore, in wine-preferring countries such as those in the Mediterranean region, alcohol-related sickness absence should reflect mainly chronic heavy drinking. All alcoholic beverages can also be used purposively as intoxicants. In this case alcohol consumption is usually taking place in leisure time, weekends and evenings. In countries where these beverages have been used mainly as intoxicants, as in the Nordic countries, per capita alcohol consumption has traditionally been quite low. In those countries alcohol-related sickness absences are based mainly on episodic heavy drinking. During recent decades total alcohol consumption has been on the increase in the Nordic countries. In Iceland, Norway and Sweden, alcohol consumption is still lower than in the Mediterranean countries, but in Denmark and Finland total alcohol consumption (unrecorded alcohol included) is, at the moment, on the same level as in France, and higher than in Italy. This convergent trend in consumption levels is also the result of the decrease in wine consumption in the Mediterranean countries. Around the Mediterranean wine is still today used mainly as a beverage with meals, but the decrease in wine consumption has meant that other uses of alcohol have gained in relative importance, and especially among young drinkers who have begun to use alcohol to become drunk. In the Mediterranean countries a decrease in wine consumption has usually meant that wine has been substituted with water as a beverage with meals. Many people living in the Mediterranean area feel that this kind of development is a substitution of one beverage (alcohol) by another drink with meals (not including alcohol). In statistics this shows as a decrease in per capita alcohol consumption. In the Nordic countries water is also increasing its share as a beverage with meals. This, however, is not reflected in alcohol consumption statistics, as the substitution in this instance is taking place mainly from milk to water. One way to describe major trends in alcohol consumption during the last decades in western Europe could be to say that water has taken over as the traditional drink with meals. Consequently, alcoholic beverages have, during the last decades, lost their role as beverages with meals and become increasingly the beverage consumed during leisure, in many cases leading to intoxication. Consequently, compared to earlier decades alcohol-related sickness absences should nowadays be related more to heavy episodic drinking than to heavy chronic drinking. When some physical or psychiatric illness related to heavy drinking is the cause for sickness absence, in many cases it is possible to link the rates of absenteeism to alcohol consumption. Many alcohol-related somatic or psychiatric illnesses such as alcoholism, alcohol-related intoxication or alcohol-related liver diseases are already, by definition, linked to drinking in the codes of the International Classification of Diseases. When episodic heavy drinking is the cause for sickness absence it is much more difficult to relate the problem to alcohol consumption. In most cases, intoxication or any other cause leading to accident is not mentioned in the medical certificate. Even in cases where it could be mentioned, it is in the interests of the client that the accident is not combined officially with alcohol use because this could lead, for instance, to loss of insurance benefits. Furthermore, hangover or a continuing drinking bout is not a legitimate cause for being absent from work. As Thor Norström [1] has shown in his analysis of the Swedish experience, total alcohol consumption level is associated with sickness absence among men. His conclusion is that sickness absence can be added to the list of harm indicators related to alcohol consumption. Alcohol-related sickness absences and wider aspects of alcohol-related productivity losses, tie alcohol consumption regularly to economic efficiency. It may, however, be somewhat difficult to measure and document the real extent of alcohol-related sickness absenteeism in anysociety, especially as alcohol-related sickness absences are nowadays related increasingly to episodic heavy drinking rather than to prolonged heavy drinking.",

Nontherapeutic use of psychoactive drugs poses an important danger to individual persons and society. What are the quantitative estimates of these risks? Are they acceptable?Because the basic mechanism of the toxic effect of alcohol or other drugs is unknown, deciding on acceptable risks is difficult. Based on current information, the recreational abuse of inhalants, hallucinogens, stimulants, narcotics and sedative-hypnotic drugs poses unacceptable individual and societal risks. Groups at special risk should not consume alcohol or any drug unless they are under medical supervision. The threshold for increased morbidity from the regular use of alcohol in adults is in the range of three to five drinks per day; this rises sharply after six drinks per day. The apparent \"safe\" level of alcohol consumption appears to be one to two drinks per day. Further basic studies are required to refine these risk estimates.",

      "title": "Social and Psychological Factors Underlying Inhalant Abuse",
      "abstract": "There are three distinct types of inhalant users: young inhalant users, adolescent polydrug users, and inhalant-dependent adults. Young inhalant users have a modal age of 12 to 13. They use inhalants and may also use alcohol and marijuana. They are likely to have more emotional problems than nondrug users or young marijuana users. These problems, particularly when they involve feelings of anger and alienation, increase the chances that they will identify with other youth who have similar feelings. When this happens, young people form peer clusters; they find a best friend or form a small gang that has a high potential for getting involved with drugs. Most of these peer clusters use inhalants only a few times a month, although some may become obsessed with inhalant use to the exclusion of nearly all other activities. The data showing that young inhalant users have more emotional problems than either nondrug users or young marijuana users suggest that treatment should involve therapy as well as drug avoidance approaches. Every youth caught using inhalants, however, should not automatically be sent for therapy. Sometimes a youth caught using a drug is not really drug involved and overreaction can be damaging. In addition, the emotional problems of all young inhalant users are not identical. A higher average level of emotional problems only means that some of the young inhalant users have those problems, not all of them. Older adolescents, including those who used inhalants earlier, are not likely to use inhalants. Since young inhalant users seem to be troubled youth, have shown an early penchant for drug use, and have drug-using associates, it seem unlikely that they quit using drugs. They probably move on to other drugs, leaving inhalants behind. The older adolescents who do use inhalants are adolescent polydrug users, with a modal age of around 15 to 16. They take many different drugs, and some of them use inhalants as well. The adolescents who use inhalants are probably using a wider range of drugs than other adolescents and are probably getting high more often. Furthermore, they are likely to be more deviant and may be involved in more aggression and more crime. Inhalant-dependent adults usually have a long history of alcohol and other drug involvement. At some point, inhalants have become their preferred drug. By that time, they are usually in their midtwenties to early thirties. They have serious problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

They may at some point have tried to stop using and, after somewhat longer or shorter periods of abstinence, have started using again. Not every drug user develops an addiction: addicts’ lives revolve around compulsive drug-seeking and use; they lose control over their own decision-making and end up relapsing. This occurs because addiction is a brain disease that can modify its structure and functioning, affecting the areas of the brain responsible for controlling our behaviour. Addiction is a public health problem affecting a high percentage of the population and leads to health, family, and work-related problems.",

Tobacco smoking is commonly associated with substance abuse, alcohol use disorders, excessive caffeine intake and pathological gambling among other addictions. Smoking reduction and cessation programmes´ objectives benefit from interventions targeting co-addictions. Objectives Difficulties arising from smoking reduction and cessation in the context of co-use of cannabis prompt literature review and reflection of a smoking cessation programme team. Methods Pubmed and Google Scholar literature search using terms smoking cessation / tobacco cessation and cannabis. Results Co-use of tobacco and cannabis is: 1) very common, 2) associated with greater prevalence of morbidity and social problems, 3) associated with greater dependence of the other substances, 4) negatively influences quit outcomes of either, 5) increases the risk of relapse. Co-users are more likely to perceive the harmful effects of tobacco, have greater motivation and are more likely to quit tobacco than cannabis, which may be perceived as low risk. Treatment of either tobacco smoking or cannabis use may lead to compensatory increase in use of the other substance. There is a significant lack of literature on co-use treatment strategies. Conclusions Co-use of tobacco and cannabis makes cessation and relapse prevention of either addiction more difficult and should be taken into account in smoking reduction and cessation programmes and in cannabis treatment interventions. Treatment targetting both tobacco and cannabis use, either simultaneously or sequentially, is likely more successful than interventions targeting only either one. Much remais to be studied on how to treat co-use of tobacco and cannabis.",

A person is usually not called \"smoker\" if s/he has smoked for a week or a month in a lifetime; in general, a smoker has been smoking for many years. Furthermore, a smoker has free access to cigarettes and can smoke whenever she/he wants, provided there are no social/legal restraints. Subsequently, in an animal model of tobacco addiction, it will be desirable to expose the animal to free access nicotine for 24 hours/day for many weeks, starting at different stages of development. Oral nicotine self-administration studies in rodents present some important advantages and mimic human smoking nicely. For example, animals are not food deprived, are exposed to nicotine choice for up to 24 hours a day for extended periods, environmental cues and learning does not interfere with self-administration of nicotine. Oral alcohol selfadministration has been used in rodents for over five decades and has contributed significantly to the understanding of alcohol addiction. We provide a review of literature and compare oral alcohol and nicotine intake in rodents. Methodological issues, post ingestional and systemic effects, discrimination and the important influences of taste, genetic vulnerability, sex and age on intake are discussed. The review ends with recommendations for future research on oral self-administration of nicotine.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Over the past few centuries, the importance of fitness has gained prominence. Coupled with this is the idea of thinness or the need to be slender and lean as an ideal body type. Thinness and fitness are not the same but are conflated in most messages about being fit. Many individuals, especially adolescents, have been influenced by the ongoing diet culture and social media. They have an ideal body or physique and are increasingly concerned about their weight, shape, size, and body image. As an attempt to lose weight and reach their goals, individuals go to extremes and try to starve themselves and/or excessively exercise, self-induce vomiting, or misuse products like laxatives, diuretics and enemas. Starvation or other psychological discomforts can cause one to binge-eat then purge and feel satisfied for a short period of time, but it eventually leads to selfloathing. This can severely affect the individual both physically and psychologically. As this cycle continues, an eating disorder is developed. Anorexia nervosa and Bulimia nervosa are the most widely recognized, and common eating disorders. Although there is little known about the pathophysiology of eating disorders, the evidence of eating disorders in the context of fitness and thinness, the potential genetic heritability, and developmentally specific age-of-onset shed some light on the aetiology of eating disorders. Research on various reactions of a brain neuropeptide called ⍺-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone (⍺-MSH), the gut microbiota and brain axis and, the monoamines- dopamine and serotonin aid in the understanding of the pathomechanisms behind eating disorders. This review aims to discuss the characteristics, risk factors, effects and the other features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. It also elaborates on the pathophysiology of eating disorders",

Although higher AS use rates are reported by elite and competitive athletes, a significant number of recreational athletes appear to be using AS. The scientific literature is inconsistent and at times at odds with the conventional wisdom and empirical experiences of the athletic community regarding the ergogenic effects of AS. However, individuals experienced in weight training, with an adequate diet, and who continue training during AS administration seem to consistently increase their strength and lean mass over what would have been expected from training alone. Previous research documenting deleterious but transient and mostly asymptomatic acute changes in physiology, risk factors and behavior has been inconclusive regarding the long term health impact. The abuse of AS constitutes a special challenge to society. AS are not euphorigenic or mood altering immediately following administration, as are other illicit drugs; the appetite for AS has been created predominantly by our societal fixations on winning and physical appearance. Consequently any successful intervention in this area must go beyond education, law enforcement and drug testing, and attempt to change a social environment which currently encourages the use of AS.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Addiction and drug abuse are pervasive in society, and can result in illness, legal and financial trouble, and even death for dependent users. Licit substances, including alcohol, are widely available, easily obtainable, and relatively inexpensive. More than 75% of Americans have used alcohol at least once in their lifetime, and more than half of adults are current drinkers. Unlike most other drugs, alcohol may be health-promoting in low to moderate doses. Excessive alcohol intake can cause serious immediate and long-term consequences to the drinker and to others. There is substantial anecdotal, clinical, and some experimental evidence that environmental factors, especially stress and social environment, affect alcohol self-administration. Stress often is associated with increased alcohol consumption. Social enrichment decreases drug self-administration, but there is mixed evidence regarding social enrichment and alcohol intake. These relationships lack experimental examination and the mechanisms underlying these relationships are not clear. The purpose of this research project was to examine experimentally the individual and combined effects of stress and social enrichment on alcohol self-administration (in two bottle choice and operant self-administration paradigms) and alcohols effects on dopaminergic and serotonergic responses in the brain (nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortex) and on psychological constructs (anxiety via open field center time and depression via forced swim test) in male Wistar rats. The major hypotheses were: (1) stress would increase alcohol consumption and increase alcohols effects on the stress response; (2) alcohol would decrease the biological and attenuate the psychological stress response; and (3) social enrichment would decrease alcohol consumption, attenuate the stress response, and attenuate alcohols effects on the stress response.",

      "abstract": "Background:When someone develops an alcohol use disorder (AUD), their addiction conditioning does not go away simply by refraining from drinking for some weeks or months.On the contrary, due to the deprivation effect, if one day they try to have just one alcoholic drink they will feel a strong and imperative biological necessity to keep drinking very fast, not being able to stop, which will lead to immediate negative consequences.The good news is that opiod receptor antagonists, such as naltrexone and nalmefene, have shown efficacy for reducing the deprivation effect, and for reducing alcohol consumption, in people who suffer from low-severity alcohol use disorders.Alcohol use disorders may turn into a persistent and relapsing disease.Many patients stop drinking easily, even without treatment, when they are overwhelmed by their \"problems\" associated with heavy drinking.Afterwards they may remain in remission for weeks or months.However, relapses may be devastating either for patients or for their families.The hypothesis of this study is that the self-monitoring treatment program with nalmefene may obtain a fast, significant, and continued reduction in alcohol consumption, without negative consequences in lowseverity AUD patients.",

      "abstract": "Looking for opportunities to squeeze more physical activity into your busy lifestyle? The second edition of The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that regular physical activity is one of the most important things that we can do to improve our health, prevent chronic disease, improve brain health, improve sleep quality, and reduce the risk of anxiety and depression. Let’s look at the guidelines and some practical ways you can apply them to your life. ✓ Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Any physical activity can aid in offsetting the risks of chronic disease. Replacing sitting with anything active is likely to produce some health benefits. - Intentionally store regularly used household items out of the way. Snacks, for example, can be stored downstairs, paper towels are a walk to the garage. - Not having ice cream in the house means that if you want it, you have to make a trip to go out and enjoy that single serving. - Try an activity tracker. Most smart phones offer some form of tracking (steps or movement). Being conscious of how much you move or do not move is the first step in achieving progress. - Walk or use mass transit instead of driving. You will be surprised how much activity you gain and how much money you will save. - Head to a mall or grab a cart and go food shopping instead of ordering online. ✓ Any activity counts. Physical activity means just that — move your body. - Focus on what you do. Often we focus on what we do not do and that leads to negative thought cycles. Start with a plan of how you will add movement into each day. - Replace sitting with standing when possible. - If you cannot stand, move while you sit. You can march while seated, for example. - Make a virtual activity call with a friend. Decide on a time to chat while you both walk. - Listen to audio books or podcasts while you walk, ride a stationary bike, or do chores. - Choose the stairs. Make this a pact with loved ones or colleagues. ✓ Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefit. Surprise yourself with what you can accomplish in 30 seconds. - Try a standing desk. - Take your colleague for a walk to brainstorm instead of sitting in a conference room. - Be a movement champion — make standing and moving during meetings a workplace mission. Adding in simple, short duration movements to your day will count toward your activity goal, for example, push-ups against a wall or kitchen counter, squatting to a chair and standing up, and knee lifts between phone calls. ✓ For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. Intensity is relative to each individual. Generally, if you can carry on a conversation during activity, it is considered moderate; if you need to catch your breath between sentences, it is more vigorous; if you can only gasp a few breathy words, it is very intense. - The easiest way to conquer this recommendation is to choose activities you enjoy and make them a part of your weekly schedule. - Social support is a key ingredient to movement success. Engage a friend or loved one in your activities. Make activity dates. Many activity trackers offer challenges you can do with friends. - Try a new activity — golf, swimming, dancing, yoga, bird watching, or aquatic exercise. - Make it a family activity. A brisk walk before or after dinner or a game of hide and seek with little ones can add up to a fun habit. - Binge-watching TV? Put a stationary bike, personal rebounder (mini-trampoline), rower, treadmill, or other equipment in front of your screen. You also can march in place while watching your favorite shows. ✓ Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week. - A scheduled 45-minute walk each day plus extra opportunities to move and you can meet this easily. - Realize those times when you are doing more activity and try and replicate it. ✓ Adults also should do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups on two or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits. Adding in strength activities adds so much value to how you feel and how well you function each day. Lifting your kids, pets, groceries, or aiding loved ones is a major part of life, and having the ability to continue to perform those functions builds confidence and independence and will count toward your weekly movement goals. - Use your big box shopping time to practice some heavy lifting. For example, a carton of 24 (16.9 oz) water bottles weighs about 28 lbs. Carry those around the store or around your house and you will quickly realize how important strength is. - Having a strength program prescribed by an ACSM certified personal trainer is ideal. Meet with the trainer regularly for motivation and form checks or intermittently for program updates. - Join a community center or gym and learn a quick circuit of exercises you can do in 30 minutes. - Try resistance bands at home to add weight/load to exercises. - The basics are still great. Push-ups, squats, lunges, planks, and triceps dips are great examples of body weight exercises that build strength. - If you ever tried to pull a stubborn weed or move a shrub, you understand that heavy gardening builds strength. Every moving minute counts toward making deposits in your activity account. Get moving for life.Sidebar: Stay Active on Vacation On a cruise? Never take the elevator. Visiting a new city? Take a walking tour. Communing with the outdoors? Try trail walking. Sports buff? Try a golf vacation, ski vacation, or learning to surf or paddle board. Zoos, water parks, and similar attractions require lots of movement — and make a lot of great memories.",

En el momento actual se encuentra independizado realizando estudios superiores. Su único soporte social es su pareja. Ingresa por amenazas autolíticas ante la imposibilidad de consumir tóxicos. Intervención El paciente presenta, desde el inicio de su seguimiento, una evolución tórpida derivada principalmente del consumo y de las conductas de búsqueda de sustancias psicoactivas. A los 15 años inicia el uso de tóxicos con cannabis y dextrometorfano, a los 17 años ya consumía semanalmente heroína y cocaína fumadas, dicho consumo se ha mantenido hasta la actualidad. Presenta múltiples ingresos por intentos autolíticos. Ha tenido conflictos legales llegando incluso a cumplir condenas de privación de libertad. El patrón de consumo es rígido, asociado a un interés restringido por el uso de sustancias y la experimentación de estados alterados de conciencia. Al explorar sus intereses el paciente cita las sustancias psicoactivas, la lingüística y la política china. Resultados y conclusiones: Las características clínicas más llamativas del Trastorno de Espectro Autista son la dificultad en la interacción social así como los intereses restringidos y las conductas repetitivas y esterotipadas. Suscita dudas sobre qué papel tiene el consumo de tóxicos en este caso, como síntoma (intereses restringidos que condicionan la actividad diaria), también se puede entender como una comorbilidad que ensombrece el pronóstico y evolución.

      "abstract": "consumo de cannabis se ha contemplado con notable sensacion de inocuidad incluso en ambientes cientificos. Se ha Uegado a contraponer su falta de efectos nocivos a los del tabaco. No es ajeno el contexto de rebeldia pero no de marginacion en que se desarrolla su consumo y que muchas personas que Io han tomado Io han dejado o ha pasado a ser aislado. Se considera, por tanto, algo pasajero, accidental, sin consecuencias y propio de una determinada fase de Ia vida o de algun momento episodico. Se ha planteado asimismo el papel dei cannabis en el tratamiento de algunas enfermedades o para minimizar los efectos indeseables de algunos tratamientos. Todo ello lleva a la necesidad de informacion sobre Ia sustancia y su entorno. Sus indicaciones, interacciones y efectos indeseables. No es facil, sin embargo Io que podria ser Ia elaboracion de un prospecto de utilizacion. Entre otros motivos porque falia la premisa de condiciones higienicas de fabricacion, manipulacion control de contaminantes y la notificacion de los problemas del consumo. El cannabis habitualmente se fuma. Sus efectos dependen de la amplitud y numero de caladas y de Ia concentracion de delta-9-tetrahidrocannabinol o THC en el cigarro. El efecto maximo se alcanza entre los tres y diez minutos y persiste de forma decreciente hasta Ias dos o tres horas. Por via oral, en forma de aceites, pasteles o infusiones, Ia absorcion es lenta e irregular. Es inactivado por los acidos dei estomago y su transformacion por el higado. El inicio de los efectos tiene lugar entre media hora y dos horas despues dei consumo y persiste unas seis horas. Se considera que Ia via oral es dos o tres veces menos potente que Ia via pulmonar. Tras el consumo de un cigarrillo puede detectarse productos de degradacion de Ia sustancia en orina durante una semana. En consumidores habitudes pueden detectarse en orina mas alla de un mes despues del ultimo consumo. El cannabis produce euforia o placer a traves de la dopamina y los opioides endogenos: bienestar, relajacion, risa facil, locuacidad, pero tambien ansiedad y pânico. Altera Ia memoria a corto plazo y la concentracion. Ocasiona enrojecimiento de Ias conjuntivas, reduccion de Ia presion intraocular, sequedad de boca. Por su efecto mitigador de vomitos se ha considerado de utilidad para hacer frente a nauseas debidos ai tratamiento medico de algunos tipos de câncer. Reduce el dolor, provoca somnolencia y puede dificultar Ia conduccion de automoviles. Incrementa Ia actividad motora, pero puede dar falta de coordinacion, dificultad en la articulacion de la palabra, temblores, debilidad y espasmos musculares. Aumenta el apetito, Ia frecuencia cardiaca, Ia presion arterial, Ia sensibilidad termica y la percepcion visual, auditiva y tactil. Da lugar a alteraciones en el espacio y tiempo y alucinaciones visuales y auditivas. Puede ocasionar alteraciones de Ia inmunidad, disminucion de Ias hormonas sexuales, aumento de la prolactina con secrecion de leche a traves de los pezones. Aumenta los riesgos obstetricos y de tumor de testiculo. Los recien nacidos de madres consumidoras de cannabis pueden tener bajo peso. La sustancia activa, el THC, atraviesa la barrera placentaria y llega hasta el feto. Tambien se acumula en la leche materna, en cantidades ocho veces superiores a su deposito en sangre.",

A longer-acting drug was desired by 22% and 60% would like to use an orally effective anticholinergic drug. Though quite a number of minor side effects are high-lighted, the majority do not consider these serious enough to stop routine use.

      "title": "To Your Health: Sensible Self-Care Can Help CPAs Maintain Stamina in the Run-Up to Those Filing Deadlines",
      "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY * Long busy-season hours give CPA's so little time for exercise or regular meals that stress can build. This can weaken a person's immune system and make him or her more prone to illness. The overload also can diminish employee performance and lead to low morale, absenteeism and high turnover among staff members. * CPAs CAN TAKE SIMPLE STEPS--both at home and at work--to develop healthful habits that mitigate stress, sustain energy and make staying fit throughout busy season an attainable goal. * TO SUPPORT STAMINA AND CONCENTRATION, a CPA with a heavy workload needs to eat when his or her body signals hunger and keep healthful, high-protein snacks in the office. * A CPA WHO CAN'T GET TO A GYM or hasn't used one can relieve stress by doing small amounts of exercise such as 10 minutes at home in the morning and another 10 minutes after work. Simple, accessible activities such as a brisk walk, a bike ride or boxing/dance moves to upbeat music will work. * IN THE OFFICE, CPAs CAN USE SHORT BREAKS for stretches, push-ups, sit-ups, toe touches and other exercises that don't require equipment. They also can take the stairs instead of the elevator or walk to lunch or to a client meeting. * A PROFESSIONAL TRAINER CAN PUT TOGETHER an exercise plan to help CPAs get the most out of their time and keep workouts safe and balanced. Once learned, routines can be done at work or at home. Long hours, especially from January to April, take their toll on CPAs. Busy season leaves so little time for exercise or regular, balanced meals that what we eat when we get a break may make us more lethargic than energetic. On top of that, the nonstop deadline pressure triggers stress, affecting everyone in the firm--from partners to staff--mentally, emotionally and physically. Such stress can lead to biochemical imbalances that weaken our immune systems, make us more prone to illness and confer a hidden--and high--cost of working in our profession. In the office environment, it contributes to diminished employee performance, low morale, conflicts, absenteeism and high turnover. Staying fit throughout busy season is attainable for everyone, however. Here are some helpful strategies I learned during my six years in the trenches at KPMG LLP. FUEL FOR THOUGHT Some things CPAs can do to mitigate stress are easier than you might think. For example, eating the right foods (particularly those high in protein) strengthens your immune system, lowers blood pressure and stabilizes your energy levels. To develop good nutritional habits that support stamina and concentration, try to * Eat when you're hungry. This may seem obvious, but it isn't common practice. Many busy people go to work in the morning without breakfast or work through lunch because they believe they don't have time for a meal. Eating when you're hungry--not starved--helps to lessen stress and control weight gain. * Keep it simple. Breakfast and lunch don't have to be elaborate to maintain energy. The proteins and carbohydrates in protein bars, fruit, cheese, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs or peanut butter on toast are sufficient. Foods that are complete proteins, such as nuts, meat or eggs, have all the amino acids your body needs to construct new proteins. Studies say they tend to stave off hunger longer. * Don't wait too long between meals. This leads to unpleasant hunger, characterized by headaches, fatigue, lack of concentration and irritability. If you wait until you feel starved, you'll overeat at the next meal. Eat at regular intervals. Set an alarm or use a kitchen timer to signal when it's time for a food break if you're likely to become immersed in your work. * Stop eating before you feel stuffed. Learn to recognize when you're no longer truly hungry. The stomach is about the size of a large baked potato, so a body has met its needs long before a stretched feeling in the stomach signals stop. …",

      "title": "Commitment Devices",
      "abstract": "Unhealthy behaviors are responsible for a high percentage of health care costs and poor health outcomes. In large companies, unhealthy behaviors by employees are considered an important challenge to affordable benefits coverage. Employers increasingly leverage incentives to encourage changes in employees’ health-related behaviors. In this viewpoint, the authors discuss the potential and the limitations of commitment devices, as distinct from incentives, to influence health behaviors. Many people intend to improve their health behaviors in the future, but when the future arrives, they fail to follow through. Many will precommit their “future selves” to follow-through by purchasing gym memberships or scheduling workouts with friends; persons with alcoholism take disulfiram in the morning so drinking alcohol in the evening will make them ill. The commitment devices increase the probability of individuals’ compliance with voluntarily imposed restrictions until they have accomplished their goals or their voluntarily imposed penalties for not reaching their goals. A common form of commitment device, also called a deposit or commitment contract, involves people voluntarily depositing money into accounts they can access again only if they accomplish a goal. These devices can help people lose weight, improve their diets, exercise more, and quit smoking. Such commitment devices have 2 basic features: people voluntarily use them and the devices link consequences to an individual’s failure to achieve preset goals. Commitment devices can be associated with various consequences. Immutable consequences cannot be reversed by future choices. They can have monetary aspects in which people risk losing their own money if, by a predetermined date, an independent assessor reports that they did not reach their goals. Commitment devices involving mutable consequences constrain future behaviors but allow people future latitude to mitigate the consequences. One form is temptation bundling or allowing people to restrict their access to instantly gratifying experiences only to occasions in which they engage in goal-consistent behaviors. Commitment devices are powerful tools for changing health behaviors, but they are underused. Maximizing the population health benefits of commitment devices requires increasing the numbers of people who use them and increasing their effectiveness. Health professionals can educate patients about the gap between intention and action. Making enrollment and participation as simple as possible by eliminating unnecessary complexity could also facilitate greater use of commitment devices. To improve population health, such devices need to be more effective. Often, health-relevant goals require changing long-term behavior even after an initial objective has been achieved. Research should investigate whether and how commitment devices can be effective tools to assist with long-term behavior change. Commitment devices can provide positive feedback as soon as people begin using them. One promising direction for future research involves leveraging the influence of existing social networks. Commitment devices that involve these networks by creating social consequences for failing to achieve goals can be implemented inexpensively. Patients are more successful at achieving their health goals when they have access to commitment devices. Strategies for achieving higher rates of ongoing engagement and sustained behavior change are needed for the devices to have widespread influence and benefit.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Aging, a wearing‐out process which affects everything inanimate and animate, is accelerated by abuse or decelerated by care. The psychologic reactions of aging persons vary considerably. The concept of growing older is much more satisfactory and pleasant than the concept of being old, since the former is applicable to everyone regardless of age whereas the latter carries a finite significance as deterioration progresses. Chronologic age is much less important than biologic age. The desideratum is not longevity but rather a long, useful and meaningful life. Although heredity is of importance in longevity, it is a factor over which at present we have no control. However, we can influence the aging process according to whether we care for or abuse the body. The principal factors in accelerated aging, in order of importance, are: 1) tobacco use (particularly cigarette smoking), 2) lack of exercise, and 3) obesity. Conversely, abstinence from tobacco, exercise within tolerance, and avoidance of obesity not only decelerate aging but result in a better quality of life.",

O individuo sob o efeito das sensacoes da substância quimica nunca esta satisfeito com a quantidade consumida, fazendo-o encontrar inumeros motivos aumentar o consumo da droga. A dependencia quimica e responsavel por problemas serios: desemprego, acidentes de trabalho, prostituicao, violencia familiar e criminalidade. Nao existe uma forma de prevenir a dependencia quimica, a melhor estrategia e nao ter o primeiro contato. E uma questao que vem aumentando no pais, em todas as faixas etarias, principalmente os jovens, isso angustia os familiares e preocupa os educadores, pois e nessa fase da vida que os adolescentes sentem-se mais atraidos ao uso da droga para a autoafirmacao no meio em esta inserido.  As formas de tratamento envolvem a interrupcao da droga, seja gradativamente ou rapidamente para alcancar a desintoxicacao. A utilizacao de farmacos e feito com medicamentos ou atraves de racionamento e moderacao buscando nao forcar uma abstinencia total da droga; o tratamento com psicoterapias pode ser realizado com ajuda em grupo ou individual. O tratamento aos usuarios de drogas e um processo longo e doloroso tanto ao usuario quanto a familia que acompanha. A enfermagem desempenha um papel importante durante a reabilitacao de usuarios de cocaina, mais tambem trabalhando com a familia passando informacoes sobre a dependencia e seu tratamento, orientando, encorajando e auxiliando nos momentos de recaida, desespero e angustia.  O objetivo do estudo e esclarecer a sociedade academica as informacoes necessarias para que todos conhecam o papel da enfermagem diante de casos de dependentes quimicos reabilitados e como deve ser tratadas.  A metodologia utilizada foi uma revisao bibliografica de livros e artigos academicos, excelente ferramenta fornecendo ao pesquisador a bagagem teorica de conhecimentos e o treinamento cientifico que habilitam a producao de trabalhos originais. A partir dessa pesquisa pode-se entender como e importante o papel do enfermeiro junto ao tratamento da dependencia quimica como tambem os efeitos da droga no organismo. Indices apontam que o dependente de tais substâncias geralmente possui baixa escolaridade, problemas psicossociais, na sua maioria desempregados e com passagem policial.  A enfermagem tem o papel de educador, para isso torna-se necessario a mesma nao manter nenhum tipo de preconceito para durante assistencia, assegurando-a sua realizacao de forma integra, eficaz e eficiente.",

      "abstract": "BAB 1PENDAHULUANA.Latar BelakangNarkoba merupakan singkatan dari Narkotika, Psikotropika dan zat adiktif lainnya BNN (2006). Narkoba pada awalnya digunakan untuk keperluan medis, pemakaiannya akan menjadi aman dan efektif apabila digunakan pada dosis tertentu, bentuk – bentuk tertentu dan juga pada waktu yang tepat. Narkoba menjadi disalahgunakan apabila digunakan untuk tujuan non medis seperti: mabuk, menurunkan berat badan dan menambah massa otot Anonymous (2006). Menurut Joewana dan Martono (2006) dibalik dampak negatifnya, penggunaan narkoba mampu untuk menimbulkan kesenangan dan juga perasaan –perasaan bahagia yang semu. Jika tidak, seseorang tidak akan mengambil resiko yang begitu besar untuk kehilangan pekerjaan, pendidikan, kesehatan dan lingkungan sosialnya. Efek yang ditimbulkan dari pemakaian narkoba adalah: hilangnya rasa kesepian, hilangnya perasaan – perasaan negatif, halusinasi, euforia berlebihan, mampu menggendalikan situasi, terbebas dari kejaran waktu, meningkatkan semangat dan rasa percaya diri. Apabila narkoba dikonsumsi secara terus menerus dan berlebihan maka pemakai akan menjadi bergantung / adiksi pada zat tersebut. Ketergantungan narkoba ini akan menimbulkan efek – efek negatif pada fisik dan juga psikologis jika pemakaiannya dihentikan, contohnya seperti: rasa nyeri pada badan, kejang – kejang, gelisah, sulit tidur, takut air, cemas, mudah tersinggung, melakukan kekerasan dan cenderung untuk bunuh diri Joewana &amp;amp; Martono (2006). Efek yang paling berbahaya dalam penyalahgunaan narkoba adalah menurunnya sistem kekebalan tubuh yang akan meningkatkan kemungkinan terjangkit virus HIV, hepatitis C bahkan sampai menyebabkan kematian (Anonymous, 2005). Pada saat ini penyalahgunaan narkoba pada kalangan remaja Indonesia menunjukan peningkatan. Berdasarkan survei nasional yang dilakukan oleh Badan Narkotika Nasional (BNN) yang berkerja sama dengan Pusat Penelitian Kesehatan Universitas Indonesia, pada tahun 2011 terdapat 2,2 persen atau sekitar 4 juta penduduk Indonesia yang menyalahgunakan narkoba. Dari jumlah tersebut 22 persen atau sekitar 880 ribu orang merupakan remaja yang masih berstatus sebagai pelajar dan mahasiswa(Anonymous, 2013). Dari data survei penyalahgunaan narkoba yang dilakukan BNN dan Universitas Indonesia pada tahun 2011 menyebutkan bahwa lokasi seperti Jawa Barat, Jawa Tengah, Aceh dan Kalimantan tengah angkanya relatif stabil bahkan khusus untuk daerah DKI Jakarta cenderung mengalami peningkatan. Responden yang mengikuti survei ini berimbang antara pria dengan wanita dengan kisaran umur antara 15 tahun sampai dengan 21 tahun yang masih berada dalam kelompok usia remaja. Hasil dari survei ini juga menyebutkan bahwa semakin tinggi tingkat pendidikan dan umur dari responden maka semakin tinggi juga penyalahgunaan terhadap narkoba. Angka penyalahgunaan lebih tinggi di kota dibandingkan dengan kabupaten dan lebih tinggi juga pada sekolah / perguruan tinggi swasta dibandingkan dengan yang lainnya (Nugroho, 2012). B.

The government’s efforts to steer the public, especially young people, away from abusing drugs have unfortunately been undermined by misleading information about the commonly abused drugs: a notable example being ‘taking Ecstasy can help you keep slim’! Those unfounded myths are due to misunderstanding or lack of knowledge on the part of the drug users.

      "abstract": "Abstract Some abstinent smokers develop withdrawal symptoms when they stop using nicotine gum or when placebo is substituted; thus, physical dependence on nicotine gum does occur. Some smokers also use nicotine gum beyond the recommended period; thus, behavioral dependence on the gum occurs. Many (7–41 %) smokers misuse nicotine gum by smoking cigarettes and chewing the gum concurrently. Among smokers who stop using the gum, many (35–90 %) do not stop gum use by the recommended 3 months, and a substantial percentage (13–38 %) persist in gum use for 1 year. Among quitters, long-term use of nicotine gum appears to be greater than that of placebo gum. If rapidity of onset and frequency of use are determinants of dependence potential, then nasal sprays and aerosols but not nicotine patches should have dependence potential. There are no reports of misuse of the gum by non-smokers; thus, the gum appears to have little if any abuse liability.",

Despite having increased her daily intake of fibre and water, she is still only passing two stools a week. Her general practitioner excludes red flag features (box) and finds no abnormality on examination, apart from a loaded rectum. He suggests she try using laxatives to increase her stool frequency, but she is reluctant as she has heard they are not very effective and can have adverse effects.\n\n#### Red flag features in chronic constipation12\n\nLaxatives are foods or drugs that, when ingested, act directly on the gut (or gut contents) to increase stool frequency or ease stool passage. They differ from motility agents such as prucalopride, which exert a promotility effect after systemic absorption. Laxatives are used to treat chronic constipation, usually defined as the presence of difficult or infrequent passage of stool, often accompanied by straining or a sensation of incomplete evacuation, with symptoms present for more than three months.\n\nChronic constipation is common in the general population. A recent meta-analysis of population based observational studies reported a pooled prevalence of 14% worldwide, with a significantly higher prevalence in women and people of lower socioeconomic status.3 However, symptoms often fluctuate, and recent community data suggest that persistent symptoms over 10 to 20 years affect only 3% of the population.4 Population based studies also show that constipation affects quality of life, is associated with several comorbidities (including haemorrhoids and anal fissure),5 and may be associated with a modest reduction in survival.6\n\nLaxatives may act by several mechanisms, including bulking the stool volume, softening the stool consistency, increasing the stool volume …",

      "title": "Life before birth: are the dice tossed for the rest of our lives?",
      "abstract": "Without any exception, every human being has spent at least a considerable amount of time in the womb and has gone through the stressful process of being born. However, the quantity and quality of our life before birth varies tremendously between people. That is, some individuals survive birth after only 22 weeks of pregnancy [1] and others have the luxury of being born after spending more than 40 weeks in utero. Perhaps more importantly than the duration are the conditions of our stay: Do we receive enough and healthy nutrition? Are we exposed to toxics like tobacco, alcohol or drugs? Is the oxygen supply sufficient? Are we being subjected to high levels of stress hormones? Are we getting infected by bacteria or viruses? And then…birth. By some considered as the most stressful life event we will ever have to endure. A certain amount of stress is actually necessary for survival: The high level of hormones released during birth, which are also involved in the stress response, are believed to make the newborn more alert promoting the bonding process and, by extension, the child’s physical survival [2]. However, while a certain amount of stress is necessary for survival, extreme and/or prolonged stress can affect health adversely [3]. For example, it has been shown that people who had underwent an extremely stressful birth (defined as vaginal delivery with fetal suffering or forceps use, urgent cesarean section indicated by fetal suffering or twin birth with death of the other fetus) were 5 times more likely to have developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in the year following a stressful life event compared to OCD patients without an extremely stressful birth [4]. In other words, the former group had more often a stress-event-related onset of OCD compared to the latter group, indexing the possibility that a very stressful birth creates a life-long enhanced vulnerability to stress and an enhanced risk of developing anxiety related symptoms, such as OCD. Animal studies also suggest that a single aversive life event may be capable of permanently affecting the individual’s sensitivity towards experiences in life after birth [5].\r\n\r\nThe importance of a prosperous prenatal environment and birth process for future health has long been recognized. Conversely, exposure to early adversity during a sensitive period of development is thought to lead to structural, physiological and metabolic changes in the fetus that increase susceptibility to later disease [6]. For instance, antenatal maternal and infant malnutrition [7, 8], antenatal maternal stress [9], low birth weight, younger maternal age and increasing birth order [10–13] have all, amongst others, been linked to poorer mental health. Particularly in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the role of adverse prenatal and perinatal factors is well-documented. Compelling evidence exists for associations between an increased risk for ASD on the one hand and maternal infections during pregnancy, increased parental age, fetal hypoxia, prematurity, and low birth weight on the other hand [14–16]. More broadly viewed, as reported by Guedeney et al. in this issue and previously by others [17–19], associations have been found between pre- and perinatal risks and sustained social withdrawal behavior (more prevalent than ASD but considered a red flag for developing clinical disorders such as ASD, attachment disorders and depression) [20–22]. In any case, life before birth is related to mental health outcomes in life after birth.\r\n\r\nHowever, it remains to be determined to what extent these factors are true risk mediators (causally involved) or rather risk indicators (linked to an increased risk but not contributing causally to the adverse outcome). Two main reasons why prenatal risks may act as risk indicators, are that these factors are associated with postnatal risks (such as social adversity and parent mental health problems) and that they relate to unmeasured confounders, such as maternally transmitted inherited factors [6]. Studies commonly deal with these two possibilities by adjusting for measured confounders. For instance, it was recently shown that when social class, family structure and religion were corrected for, prenatal circumstances were not or only marginally associated with mental health outcomes in adolescence and young adulthood [23]. Further support for the hypothesis that perinatal factors may often act as indicators instead of mediators of poor mental health was reported in a series of elegantly designed studies by Thapar and colleagues [24–26]. Using genetically informative designs, in which mothers were either genetically related or unrelated to their child as a result of assisted reproductive technologies, they showed that relationships between smoking during pregnancy and ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms, and also between breastfeeding and lower levels of conduct problems, were only present in the genetically related group and not in the genetically unrelated group [24–26]. These studies teased apart the intrauterine and genetic influences normally intertwined in explaining the fetal origins of chronic diseases and suggest pre- and perinatal risk factors may sometimes act as a proxy for the underlying genetic risk transmitted to offspring.\r\n\r\nHowever, elegant as these studies may be in examining the role of prenatal risks in isolation from a genetic background, the reality of life is that the vast majority of people are conceived in the natural way and spend their life before and after birth with their biological parents. Therefore, genetic and environmental factors correlate and interact in various complex ways, causing substantial differences between people in their exposure and susceptibility to both positive and negative environmental influences [27, 28]. This differential susceptibility may be labeled as “prenatal programming of postnatal plasticity” [29] and one of the mechanisms underlying this may be epigenetics. Epigenetics can be broadly defined as those heritable changes not dependant on the genomic sequence and encompasses a variety of mechanisms to dynamically modify the expression of the genome [30]. There appear to be “discrete epigenetic checkpoints” [30] during which the genome is extra sensitive to modifications by environmental factors. This illustrates that in real life there is no effect of prenatal risk in isolation from a genetic background or vice versa.\r\n\r\nSo, in life before birth, are the dice tossed for the rest of our lives? The influence of the prenatal environment on mental health later in life is unequivocally present. Often the dice are unfairly being tossed, with some children receiving the best of odds and others the worst. However, what the best odds are is not predetermined, but may vary according to the environment in which the child grows up. In some cases, the last shall be the first.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A substance problem is any negative outcome from prescription drug misuse, illegal drug use, or binge drinking. These problems often lead to substance use disorders (SUDs). Any substance use can cause problems. The real issues are a person’s reasons for using, and whether that substance use is part of a substance use disorder. Family members often think of the drug as being the problem when it is really the person’s pattern of use and reasons for using that are the problems. Drugs come and go and are replaced by new ones all the time. SUDs and addiction are people problems that involve drugs.",

A good deal of confusion that exists in the literature on this subject is due, as Terry and Pellens1have pointed out, to variation in individual susceptibility and the amount of daily dosage and to the failure to distinguish between drug balance and early Opium addicts, when once hooked, as they so aptly express their plight, need a certain daily dosage to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. In certain types of users, this dosage may remain constant in small quantities for years.

Participants used palm-top computers to record their first lapse, and their reaction to it, within minutes of the event, and were followed for 3 months to assess subsequent smoking. Indicators of the Abstinence Violation Effect--self-efficacy, attributions, and affective reactions to the lapse--generally failed to predict progression to relapse, but participants who felt like giving up after the first lapse progressed more rapidly to a second lapse. Participants who attempted restorative coping were less likely to progress to another lapse on the same day. Those whose lapses were triggered by stress progressed more quickly, whereas those triggered by eating and drinking or accompanied by alcohol consumption progressed more slowly. More nicotine-dependent participants progressed more rapidly toward relapse, but neither the amount smoked in the first lapse nor its subjective reinforcement predicted progression.",

      "abstract": "For patients who have difficulty swallowing, a common solution is to crush tablets or open capsules. What are the consequences of this practice? We reviewed the main evidence available using the standard Prescrire methodology. The clinical consequences for the patient of crushing tablets or opening capsules can be serious: alteration of the drug's absorption can result in sometimes fatal overdose, or conversely underdosing, rendering the treatment ineffective. When it disrupts a drug's sustained-release properties, the active ingredient is no longer released and absorbed gradually, resulting in overdose. When a gastro-resistant layer is destroyed by crushing, underdosing is likely. The active ingredient released may degrade on contact with light, moisture or the food with which it is mixed for administration. The person who crushes the tablets or opens the capsules is exposed to drug particles, which may be carcinogenic, teratogenic or fetotoxic. They are sometimes allergenic. In practice, there are many drugs that should never be crushed or opened. Before crushing a tablet or opening a capsule, it is better to consider and research the impact it will have on the drug's effects. It is sometimes preferable to use a different dosage form, or a different active ingredient.",

      "title": "Vaping culture: An emerging epidemic and its impact",
      "abstract": "Madam, Over the past decade, vaping––defined as the inhalation of aerosolized nicotine produced by electronic cigarettes (“e-cigarettes”) has become prevalent among teenagers and adolescents. The modern designs, social acceptance, and wide variety of flavours have made vaping increasingly convenient, accessible, and appealing to young people. Combined with a lack of awareness about their long-term side effects, this has contributed to their growing allure compared to traditional cigarettes (1). In Pakistan, 6.2% of individuals use e-cigarettes. Originally marketed as a less harmful alternative to smoking and a cessation aid, Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) also gained popularity because some smoking cessation pills are carcinogenic (2). Although e-liquids pose a lower threat than conventional cigarettes, they still carry significant health risks that require attention. Particularly concerning is their impact on the respiratory system with association with conditions such as aggravated asthma, bronchitis, altering pulmonary function, and cognitive impairment. Users are likely to be exposed to heavy metals from the device, which may be carcinogenic or toxic to the heart and lungs. Additionally, ingredients present in the e-liquids, such as propylene glycol, can irritate the respiratory tract. Beyond physical health, vaping has also been linked to mental health problems in adolescents, including anxiety, depression, and ADHD (3). Nicotine exposure can disrupt brain development, increasing the potential of developing nicotine addiction, along with the gateway hypothesis, which suggests that e-liquids might lead to the use of more harmful substances like cigarettes and cannabis, thus undermining the very practice it was intended to avoid. This highlights the misleading nature of the product’s advertising (4). To protect future generations from the dangers of this growing trend, preventive measures are essential. Despite limited research on prevention, key public health policies should be introduced. These include allocating resources for additional research, prohibiting marketing aimed at younger demographics, and establishing an ID system to restrict purchases to individuals 18 and older. Products should be sold only through licensed retailers, and an additional tax on e-cigarettes should be implemented, along with required warning labels on each device, to discourage sales. Public awareness campaigns should educate the public, and educational programs should aim to alter the perception of vaping among students, emphasizing its negative consequences. These efforts should collectively work toward shifting the social perception of vaping from normalized to disapproved, akin to smoking (2).",

      "abstract": "adulterants, substance use disorder, opioids: Drug users may not get what they bargained for when buying pills, powder, or other forms of drugs from a street dealer. Contaminants and adulterants are found in the vast majority of drugs bought on the street, and cocaine, heroin, and other opioids are rarely pure drugs. Even pharmaceutical-grade pills are often bogus, even if packaged to appear to be from a legitimate source. Illicitly manufactured drugs commonly contain additional pharmacologically active components used to increase the bulk of the product, simulate a street drug's effects, or to enhance the potency of the primary product. There are no controls or quality measurers used in these adulterants, they can be chemicals or products from around the home or garage, and the additives themselves can be toxic.FigurePrescription opioids account for about a third of all deaths from opioid use, and they sometimes have numerous adulterants that are doled out to unsuspecting users. Pure cocaine and heroin are rarely available on the street these days, with many additives and contaminants used to increase the amount of the substance sold and to produce symptoms similar to those of the pure drug. Likewise, unadulterated opioids are rarely available to drug users, and it is quite amazing how many nonopioid contaminants can be found in these substances. The number of overdose deaths increased from 23,500 in 2002 to 70,200 in 2017, and opioid deaths increased fourfold, from 11,900 in 2002 to 47,600 in 2017. (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2018;67[5152]:1419; https://bit.ly/3eiTdOK; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. December 2018.) Many of these deaths were related to the user unknowingly using adulterated or tainted street drugs. The Emerging Role of Toxic Adulterants in Street Drugs in the U.S. Illicit Opioid Crisis Singh VM, Browne T, Montgomery J Public Health Rep. 2020;135(1):6 https://bit.ly/2SR0Zbn The rate of opioid overdose deaths rose from 42,000 in 2016 to 47,600 in 2017, a 13 percent increase in just one year. Deaths from cocaine and the number of overdose deaths related to prescription opioids, however, have remained relatively constant. A total of 28,400 of the estimated 38,000 opioid deaths in 2018 involved non-methadone synthetic opioids; the most common was illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Fentanyl as an adulterant was largely responsible for the increased number of deaths, but the presence and danger of multiple toxic adulterants are also important issues in opioid-related deaths. Importantly, the number of deaths from prescription opioids was and still is declining. About 60 percent of opioid-related deaths now are due to non-methadone synthetic opioid adulterants. This is a marked 45 percent increase from the previous year, highlighting the fact that manufactured opioids have become the main driver of the nation's opioid crisis. Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are produced in clandestine laboratories rather than commercial pharmaceutical laboratories. Synthetic opioids have been detected in about 60 percent of opioid-related deaths. Ninety percent of those who died from opioids in Florida had nonopioid toxic components in their system at autopsy. Illicit fentanyl is clearly complicating and amplifying the death rate from opioids. It is sold on the street as a powder and mixed with heroin and other less potent opioids. Fentanyl and other added lethal adulterants often go undetected and unreported because current toxicology laboratories are unable to identify them. Suspected but unidentified adulterants can lead to renal and liver problems, blood disorders, infectious diseases, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest. An additional pharmacologically active substance was found in 97 percent of street drug samples in Vermont and in 89 percent of those in Kentucky. As many as nine additional components were identified in these samples. It would not be uncommon to find as many as 11 additional components in the systems of those who died of drug overdose at autopsy. Obviously, failure to recognize or identify toxic adulterants will hinder timely and appropriate treatment and could even interfere with life-saving measures. The presence of multiple pharmacologically active components in street drugs is simply amazing. The table demonstrates the amazing number of components found in street drugs seized as cocaine in Kentucky and Vermont in 2017. Determination of Cutting Agents in Seized Cocaine Sample Using GC-MS, GC-TMS and LC-MS/MS Fiorentin TR, Fogarty M, et al. Forensic Sci Int. 2019;295:199 The authors of this study attempted to quantify cocaine and cutting agents in 116 samples of cocaine using sophisticated laboratory methods. The analysis was done at the NMS Laboratories in Willow Grove, PA, probably the most advanced toxicology laboratory in the country. NMS uses gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and other state-of-the-art tests not generally available to clinicians. The testing was done specifically to evaluate for cocaine, levamisole, benzocaine, phenacetin hydroxyzine, theophylline, acetaminophen, and caffeine. Cocaine was the only compound in only 17 percent of samples billed as cocaine. The most common cutting drug was levamisole, found in 80 percent of all samples. The percentage of levamisole in the samples was occasionally as high as 75 percent. This is one of many articles showing that street drugs are nowhere near what is advertised. Many agents are added to give a CNS effect or produce an effect that the user would identify as that of the sought-after illicit compound. Complications from adulterants can be significant. Cardiac arrest and other cardiac complications have been well described from quinine and quinidine used to cut heroin sold to IV drug users. (J Gen Intern Med 2012;27[12]:1722; https://bit.ly/3r9fNi2.) Levamisole has increasingly been found in street cocaine as an adulterant (Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2010;88[3]:408), and this may have led to the withdrawal of the drug from the U.S. market. Levamisole was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an immunomodulator, a chemotherapy adjuvant, and an anthelmintic medication. Toxicology laboratories will not routinely assay for levamisole. The purpose of adulterating street cocaine with levamisole is not known. It has been speculated that it is added to potentiate the effects of cocaine. There have also been reports of the metabolism of levamisole to aminorex in racehorses. Aminorex and related compounds, specifically 4-methylaminorex, or “ice,” have high abuse potential because of their amphetamine-like pharmacological activity, but the intended role of levamisole in street cocaine remains unclear. Cardiac Complications of Unwitting Co-injection of Quinine/Quinidine with Heroin in an IV Drug User Phillips KA, Hirsch GA, et al. J Gen Intern Med. 2012;27(12):1722 https://bit.ly/3r9fNi2 This article emphasizes the omnipresence of unusual products used to cut street drugs and some of the bizarre complications encountered by the unwary drug user. Clinicians in an ideal world would be able to quickly identify contaminants and be equipped to deal with the accompanying complications, but this is clearly not possible given the many adulterants used by drug dealers. The clinicians in this case identified the presence of quinine/quinidine in a street drug sold as heroin. The purity of heroin sold in Baltimore in 2019 ranged from an amazingly low zero to 36 percent, according to the Baltimore office of the DEA. Adulterants included acetaminophen, caffeine, diphenhydramine, methorphan, alprazolam, quetiapine, chloroquine, diltiazem, cocaine, procaine, lidocaine, quinine/quinidine, phenacetin, and thiamine. The authors reported the case of an asymptomatic 31-year-old man participating in a drug research study who was found to have an accelerated atrioventricular junctional rhythm on an ECG performed before the study. This patient had a complicated medical history, including IV heroin dependence, hepatitis C, and tobacco dependence. He was taking methadone (100 mg/day) but had no symptoms on initial evaluation. His vital signs and initial laboratory tests were normal, and a drug screen was positive for methadone. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed minimal abnormalities, including an ejection fraction of 50%-55%, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and trace pulmonary and mitral regurgitation. The most common cause of accelerated junctional rhythm is digitalis toxicity, but it can be caused by a number of other medications and conditions. A GC/MS analysis of the patient's urine identified codeine/morphine, methadone, acetaminophen, and quinine/quinidine. Methadone is associated with bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, faintness, and syncope. Note that a urine GM/MS toxicology test cannot differentiate between quinidine and quinine, but that differentiation is not clinically required for the emergency physician. The accelerated atrioventricular junctional rhythm reported in this case has not been associated with methadone. Quinine/quinidine was the second most common adulterant in heroin in Baltimore and was found in 64 percent of samples in 2009-1010. Quinine/quinidine as an adulterant produces a bitter heroin-like taste, and the hypotensive rush produced can mimic a heroin rush. Both characteristics are used by drug buyers to identify heroin on the street by tasting a small drug sample, an activity often seen on TV shows. An amazing number of adulterants have been found in street drug samples throughout the country. Levamisole was found in 62 percent of cocaine-positive urine samples in 2009. Why levamisole would be used as a cutting agent for cocaine is confusing. It can cause agranulocytosis, ear lobe necrosis, and laboratory findings of antiphospholipid syndrome. (Find additional discussion about the toxicology of levamisole in EMN. 2019;41[10]:16; http://bit.ly/2osdXN6 and EMN. 2014;36[5]:1; https://bit.ly/3B59FfB.) - Common Adulterants and Contaminants in Opioids and Cocaine Street Samples Acetaminophen Quetiapine Aminopyrine Cocaine Diltiazem Heroin Diphenhydramine Papaverine Dipyrone Acetyl codeine Levamisole Noscapine Phenacetin Tramadol Caffeine Ketamine Quinine Lidocaine Phenacetin Fentanyl Eighty-three percent of street drug samples collected in Vermont contained five or more components, and 15 percent contained nine or more. Eighty-nine percent of samples collected in Kentucky contained one additional pharmacologically active component, and 32 percent had five or more additional components.Source: Public Health Rep. 2020;135(1):6; https://bit.ly/2SR0Zbn. No significant clinical complications were noted, and this patient did not stop using heroin, but he did decrease his use. An ECG repeated three days later showed sinus bradycardia with a period of atrioventricular dissociation plus slight junctional acceleration, which occurred at a slower rate than in earlier ECGs. A cardiologist confirmed that this change reflected an improvement in the rate and rhythm. The patient's decreased heroin use presumably resulted in decreased unwitting co-injection of quinine/quinidine, accompanied by a dose-related improvement in ECG parameters. This case illustrated an accelerated junctional rhythm that may have resulted from a drug or drugs unwittingly injected during intravenous heroin use. Drug adulterants may produce arrhythmias or other medical complications, as well as toxicity from unsuspected drug-drug interactions. Quinidine alone has more than 135 major interactions. (See common ones in the table.) When treating patients who use illicit drugs, physicians should look beyond the known drugs of abuse for adulterants and diluents to determine possible etiologies of cardiac and other medical complications. Clinicians should also be aware that standard urine toxicology tests do not detect diluents and adulterants, and that tests such as a urine GC/MS should be performed if the clinical picture warrants it. Obviously, given the tremendous number of adulterants and substitutions found in street drugs, it is impossible for the clinician to identify all such interventions to street drugs. It seems like few street drugs are exactly as advertised, and clandestine activities by drug dealers will only increase. Exactly how far the clinician should go in pursuing these issues is a puzzle.

Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States; almost 20 million Americans currently consume cannabis. People who use cannabis may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after use. Synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Cessation after regular use may result in drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness. Metabolites of THC can be detected in the urine up to 1 month after last use; some medications can cause false-positive tests. Serious medical complications of cannabis use are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users and acute cognitive and motor impairment. Synthetic cannabinoid use is associated with significant neuropsychological effects. Psychosocial modalities appear to help those who wish to stop or reduce use. There are no medications that have been shown to be effective.",

Namun di sisi lain dapat menimbulkan ketergantungan yang sangat merugikan apabila digunakan tanpa adanya pengendalian,pengawasan yang ketat dan seksama. Penyalahgunaan narkotika adalah suatu bentuk penggunaan narkoba tanpa hak dan melawan hokum, namun masih ada pihak yang menyembunyikan pemakai narkoba terutama yang sering dilakukan oleh pihak keluarga, dengan berbagai alasan mereka tidak ada keinginan melaporkan keluarganya melakukan penyalagunaan narkoba tersebut.&#x0D; Adapun upaya yang dapat dilakukan jika mengetahui ada saudara/anggota keluarga yang menjadi penyalahguna/korban penyalahguna narkotika yang akhirnya kecanduan menggunakan narkotika, seorang pecandu narkotika wajib melaporkan dirinya sendiri maupun melalui keluarga agar direhabilitasi pada lembaga rehabilitasi/rumah sakit yang ditunjuk oleh pemerintah setelah melalui proses assessment, sehingga mereka dapat dipulihkan atau disembuhkan dari ketergantungan akan narkotika",

      "title": "Influences of social stress in the rewarding effects of mdma and alcohol",
      "abstract": "La adiccion a las drogas es un importante problema en nuestra sociedad con graves consecuencias juridicas, medicas y sociales para los consumidores. Se trata de un trastorno caracterizado por la perdida de control sobre el uso de la droga, su busqueda compulsiva y la aparicion de un estado emocional negativo en ausencia de la misma. El alcohol es la droga legal mas consumida tanto por adultos como por adolescentes. Por otra parte, entre las sustancias ilegales, los datos epidemiologicos apuntan que el extasis o MDMA es una sustancia ampliamente consumida entre los adolescentes y adultos jovenes sobre todo en fiestas “rave” donde los consumidores pasan horas, incluso dias, haciendo uso de esta sustancia. La adolescencia constituye un periodo de alta vulnerabilidad debido a la inmadurez cerebral, siendo muy perjudicial en esta fase de la vida el consumo de drogas y la exposicion a situaciones ambientales negativas. En concreto, se ha demostrado que el estres social puede provocar el inicio, escalada y la reinstauracion en el consumo de drogas en modelos animales. Por ello, el objetivo del presente trabajo ha sido estudiar los factores implicados en las propiedades reforzantes de MDMA (1.25 y 10 mg/kg) y alcohol (1.25 y 2.5 g/kg), principalmente el efecto del estres social agudo y repetido en ratones macho adolescentes y adultos jovenes. Una de las tecnicas metodologicas mas utilizadas ha sido la induccion de estres por derrota social mediante encuentros agonisticos (agudos o repetidos). Para evaluar si el estres social modifica el valor reforzante de la MDMA o el alcohol se ha utilizado principalmente el paradigma de condicionamiento de lugar pero tambien se ha evaluado el consumo voluntario de alcohol (“two-bottle choice”). Este procedimiento y el de autoadministracion (“second order”) se han utilizado para estudiar los efectos de los antagonistas opiaceos mu (naltrexona y GSK 1521498) en el consumo de alcohol en ratas. Asimismo otras tecnicas conductuales han sido utilizadas para medir procesos como ansiedad, memoria, aprendizaje, interaccion social o actividad motora entre otros tras la administracion de derrota, MDMA o su combinacion. Los datos obtenidos indican que la exposicion al estres social (tanto agudo como a largo plazo) incrementa los efectos reforzantes de MDMA y alcohol y produce diferentes alteraciones conductuales, por ejemplo una reduccion de la conducta social, que pueden estar relacionadas con el incremento en los efectos reforzantes. Asimismo, la combinacion de estres y MDMA induce un importante deterioro de la memoria y el estado emocional. Los antagonistas glutamatergicos (memantine y CNQX) y la inhibicion de la sintesis de oxido nitrico (7-nitroindazole) bloquean los efectos reforzantes de la MDMA y tambien parecen estar implicados en los efectos del estres. El antagonismo de los receptores opiaceos mu disminuye la busqueda y consumo de alcohol. El avance en el conocimiento de los sistemas de neurotransmision implicados en los efectos reforzantes de la MDMA y el alcohol y en la influencia del estres sobre estos efectos puede contribuir al desarrollo de estrategias farmacologicas para el tratamiento de la adiccion a la estas drogas.",

      "abstract": "A questionnaire, administered to random samples of students on the Yale and Wesleyan campuses, revealed that one of every five students on each campus had used hallucinogenic drugs at least once in his lifetime. Marijuana was by far the most popular. There was no appreciable difference between the two campuses as to whether students had ever used it or, if so, when they first tried it, but the students from Wesleyan used it more heavily and more recently. Wesleyan students were more likely to have used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at some point and showed some tendency to have used it more recently, but did not differ significantly as to total cumulative use or the time they first tried it. For all hallucinogens, all users reported experiencing pleasant effects much more frequently than unpleasant effects. A majority of all nonusers reported knowing someone who had used hallucinogens, and a sizeable minority reported having seriously considered trying it.",

The health effects of low versus moderate to high chronic tobacco consumption in comparison with no smoking; 2. The health effects reducing chronic high, moderate or low smoking while maintaining some use versus quitting. This document provides some answers to the following questions: Q1. Is chronic low tobacco smoking (loose leaf tobacco, cigarettes) associated with: a) an accrued mortality and morbidity versus no smoking; b) a lesser risk of mortality and morbidity versus chronic moderate or high consumption? Q2.1. Is decreased chronic consumption associated with reduced mortality of morbidity versus stable consumption? Q2.2. Is the mortality and morbidity risk associated with reduced consumption similar to that of quitting? This literature review, based on original articles from powerful cohort studies with long follow-up periods, shows the following results: Q1a. Even low chronic consumption (0 15 cpd) may benefit from a slight risk reduction if they decrease consumption, probably due to an excessive risk from the outset. However, there is insufficient proof to say whether the reduced incidence of lung cancer is associated with reduced rates of all- cause mortality.",

      "abstract": "In India, tobacco is used in a variety of forms such as smoking, chewing, local applications, drinking and gargling, leading to detrimental health effects such as increased incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and cancer, in addition to detrimental reproductive outcomes, dental and oral diseases. Tobacco use, in any form, is more popular in lower socio -economic groups. Betel -quid chewing-a mixture of areca nut, slaked lime, catechu, other spices and condiments rapped in a betel leaf-is a popular, socially accepted, ancient custom and the introduction of tobacco reinforced this practice. Chewing products are kept all day and sometimes even all night in the buccal sulcus or pouch; usually in the anterior part of the mouth in populations from North India, and in the posterior part among South Indians, colouring the mouth in red. The vast majority of people using tobacco today began doing so when they were adolescents. Prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors (less than 18 years) and increasing the price of tobacco products through higher taxes, banning tobacco advertising and ensuringsmoke -free environments are crucial.Globally, at least 1 in 10 adolescents aged 13-15 years uses tobacco, although there are areas where this figure is much higher.",

Sie werden millionenfach in Deutschland missbraucht, um von den Alltagsproblemen abzulenken. Seit Jahrzehnten ist bekannt, dass die Mitglieder aus den unteren sozialen Schichten der Gesellschaft mit geringeren beruflichen Qualifizierungen davon zu einem größeren Teil betroffen sind als Menschen mit höheren Schul- und Hochschulabschlüssen. Besondere Zielgruppen für Tabak und Alkohol sind zeitweilig oder langzeitig Arbeitslose sowie allein lebende Menschen. Wenn es um das Rauchen geht, werden Kinder und Frauen davon mehr betroffen als Männer. Die Vereinsamung des Menschen, oft einhergehend mit dem Auftreten depressiver Reaktionen oder von Depressionen, begünstigt den Griff zur Zigarette. Sozial schwache Menschen geben bis zu 20 % ihres Einkommens für Tabakwaren aus. In zahlreichen Industrieländern wird der Zeitpunkt des Rauchbeginns in immer frühere Lebensjahre verlegt, wodurch vermeidbare Erkrankungen in immer früheren Lebensjahren zu beobachten sind. Das bedeutet, dass vermeidbare Erkrankungen über immer längere Zeiträume medizinisch versorgt werden müssen. In den kommenden Jahren müssen wirksame Präventionsprogramme gegen das Rauchen insbesondere für die sozioökonomisch schlecht gestellten Bevölkerungsteile entwickelt werden, um die Finanzierbarkeit der Gesundheitssysteme in den kommenden Jahrzehnten überhaupt noch zu ermöglichen.",

High doses of some single nutrients may improve immunity in relatively short time periods (weeks to months), but persistence of these effects is not currently known. High doses of other micronutrients may adversely affect immunity. Some micronutrients may interfere with the beneficial effects of other micronutrients on immunity; this effect depends on relative doses. Low- to moderate-dose multivitamin/mineral supplements may require considerable time (6 mo to 1 yr or more) before they enhance immune functions and potentially reduce susceptibility to infectious diseases, and the timing of their effects may differ between men and women. High- and even low-dose micronutrient supplements may enhance immunity even in the absence of evidence of underlying deficiencies. Micronutrient supplements are not a substitute for a good diet and regular exercise but, rather, are a complementary measure. Long-term ingestion of single nutrient supplements, especially at high doses, may have beneficial and/or adverse effects on immunity and other outcomes.",

      "title": "Amounts of Fluoride in Self-Administered Dental Products: Safety Considerations for Children",
      "abstract": "With the increased use of various fluoride preparations for caries prevention, all dental personnel should know their potential toxicity and the margins of safety associated with their use. An understanding of the body's mechanisms for handling fluoride provides a rational basis for assessing the possible risks of excessive fluoride ingestion. Five to 10 g of sodium fluoride is considered a certainly lethal dose for a 70-kg adult. One quarter of the certainly lethal dose can be ingested without producing serious acute toxicity and is known as the safely tolerated dose. Comparisons of certainly lethal and safely tolerated doses for commonly used fluoride agents and procedures show that they can be applied with little or no risk of adverse acute effects, as long as they are used judiciously. If their use is abused, there is a risk of illness or even death. If amounts of fluoride close to the certainly lethal dose are ingested, the speed of initiating proper treatment is critical for survival. Vomiting should be induced, if it is not spontaneous; fluoride-binding liquids, such as milk or liquid or gel antacids, administered; and the patient taken to the nearest hospital for emergency care. Frequent ingestion of low but excessive quantities of fluoride during the period of tooth formation can lead to dental fluorosis. Particular concern is warranted for the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpastes by young children and the inappropriate use of dietary fluoride supplements in communities with sufficient fluoride already present in drinking water. Parents should brush the teeth of preschool children or, at the very least, dispense only small amounts of toothpaste for them (a pea-sized portion). Dentists and physicians should know the fluoride concentration of a patient's water supply before prescribing fluoride supplements. Fluoride preparations should be dispensed in appropriate quantities; labeled with suitable cautionary statements; packaged, when appropriate, with child-proof closures or in tear-proof materials; and stored in safe locations. Practitioners should use only Food and Drug Administration or American Dental Association approved products, use recommended methods for their delivery, know their toxicity, and be familiar with emergency measures for treating accidental overdosages. The risk of adverse effects is small when fluorides are used judiciously.",

      "abstract": "Caffeinated energy drinks (EDs) are increasingly popular among adolescents despite growing evidence of their negative health effects. The consumption of EDs has seen a substantial increase during the past few decades, especially in the Western and Asian countries. EDs contain high levels of caffeine, sugar, and novel ingredients, and are often marketed through youth-oriented media and venues. The known and unknown pharmacology of the constituents of EDs poses a risk of caffeine toxicity and other ill effects when consumed by young people. Caffeine intoxication may result in tachycardia, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and even death. Other health concerns related to consumption of EDs include obesity and dental enamel erosion resulting from the acidity of EDs. Coingestion of caffeine and ethanol has been associated with increased risk-taking behaviors in adolescent users, impaired driving, and increased use of other illicit substances. Several researchers have demonstrated that consuming alcohol mixed with energy drinks leads to altered subjective states including decreased perceived intoxication, enhanced stimulation, and increased desire to drink/increased drinking compared to consuming alcohol alone. Caffeine's effect on intoxication may be most pronounced when mixers are artificially sweetened, that is, lack sucrose which slows the rate of gastric emptying of alcohol.1) health care providers should educate youth and their parents about the risks of caffeinated drinks; 2) emergency department clinicians should consider asking patients about ED and traditional caffeine usage and substance use when assessing patient symptoms; 3) policy makers should increase their attention on introducing regulatory policies on television food advertising to which youth are exposed; 4) failure to comply with standards for efficacious product labelling, and absence of broader education regarding guidelines, need to be addressed and 5) further studies must be done to improve our understanding of potential negative consequences of caffeinated energy drinks on health.",

In Europe, Khatchewing has also spread among members of the Somali community in Rome. The chewing of Khat is the most common method of use but it can also be smoked and taken as tea. The effects include euphoria, increased alertness, excitement with an improved ability to communicate etc. Various physical and psychological problems have been reported among Khat users. Strong associations have been found between Khat use and histories of anorexia, constipation, insomnia, headaches and respiratory problems. Depression and feelings of anxiety seemed to be less common although various forms of psychosis have been associated with Khat among migrant populations such as the Somali population. The prevalence of tobacco smoking is high among the Khat chewers in the London's study. Although illegal drugs are relatively uncommon among Khat chewers, cannabis use has been reported. It is considered that there are no physical symptoms or withdrawal of Khat or tolerance in contrast to the marked tolerance observed with amphetamine misuse. Despite the widespread of Khat use, few individuals appear to request help with their Khat use. It is clear that the pattern and perceptions of Khat use are changing among the community of Khat chewers.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine, a potent stimulant found in tobacco products, has significant effects on oral health and overall well-being. Saliva samples showing the presence of nicotine can be very helpful as evidence in a variety of situations. Salivary nicotine levels can reveal smoking habits. It offers proof of whether a person has recently used tobacco goods. Saliva testing can be used, for instance, to support or contradict smoking behaviours in court cases involving custody disputes, child endangerment, or employment regulations. Saliva nicotine testing can be used in criminal investigations to determine a suspect's smoking history. If saliva includes nicotine traces, it can be used to identify the person to a place or occasion, particularly at the crime scene which may reveal discarded cigarette butts or other tobacco-related evidence. Also, exposure to nicotine impacts general health. Saliva tests can reveal whether or not a person uses tobacco, which is important information for determining health risks. For example, nicotine testing can be used by medical practitioners to assess a patient's willingness to stop smoking or to track their progress while participating in smoking cessation programmes. Moreover, some insurance providers take nicotine usage into account when setting insurance premiums or providing coverage. Saliva test results can impact judgments about disability claims, health insurance, and life insurance. However, it's crucial to properly interpret the findings of nicotine tests. Due to the variety of benefits associated with the identification of salivary nicotine, this article aims to develop an affordable technique that can facilitate the in-situ, real-time detection of nicotine in saliva samples.",

People sometimes overborrow money in order to spend it on leisure and/or luxury items, overeat, spend indulgent times, smoke, and gamble to the point of destitution. In all of these situations, the results of the choice to engage in such behaviors have adverse effects on the individual’s future. Moreover, self-harmful behavior is not always limited to the extreme cases described above. For example, on occasion, we sometimes stay up drinking until late at night even though we have a meeting early the next morning.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug abuse occurs widely in various parts of the world. The drugs that are misused are not only cocaine, or heroin, but also drugs that are commonly prescribed. If you want to get drunk, usually use dextromethorphan (DMP) pills, but now switch to mixing herbal cough medicines with energy drinks. Herbal cough medicine is usually used as a cough reliever, but in teens today, herbal cough medicine is starting to be abused. Mixing energy drinks using herbal cough medicine are motivated by a lack of positive activities or activities, influenced by peers or the environment where the subject lives, lack of application of religious and school education, lack of the role of parents in supervising their children, easy access to herbal cough medicines and drinks energy in large quantities, and the price is cheap. The crime that occurred is not only limited to theft but also drugs and drinking. The only difference, they are not drunk with liquor, but mixed energy drinks with some herbal cough medicine sachets. CASE REPORT: We found a case of acute psychotic disorders due to cannabis use and other psychoactive substances, namely, a mixture of herbal cough medicine containing DMP and energy drinks containing caffeine, after 2 days of use, in a 20-year-old male, found a delusion and hallucinations. CONCLUSIONS: Every use of addictive substances and psychotropic substances will have an impact on life and health. The use of addictive and psychotropic substances when consumed in excess of the dose will damage some organ functions, affect the smooth operation of organ systems, and can also cause acute psychosis.",

      "title": "Toxicology of Substances that Affect Performance and Behaviour",
      "abstract": "Abstract The use of drugs to enhance performance has become a matter of increasing concern in recent years. However, with the advent of a greater range of pharmacologically active substances, and the possibility of psychological or financial reward, the temptation to use drugs in the pursuit of enhanced sporting performance or body image has increased. Regulation of drugs in sport seeks to prevent the use of banned substances and techniques whilst allowing the legitimate use of therapeutic interventions for genuine medical conditions. The use of performance enhancing drugs may be accompanied by serious, even life threatening side effects. Performance enhancing drugs may be used at the time of competition, or as a ‘training aid’ outside the competitive season, for example to increase muscle bulk. Their effect may be to increase strength or to allow a greater power output, for example by increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. Abused drugs include androgenic anabolic steroids, creatine, beta‐2 agonists, beta blockers, peptide hormones and diuretics. Techniques to improve oxygen delivery include the use of high altitude training, autologous blood transfusions and the use of erythropoietin. Successful detection of abused drugs is fundamental for regulatory programs to be successful. Such programs should include random out of season testing, rigorous sample handling protocols and reliable analytical techniques. The advent of synthetic hormones with structures similar or identical to endogenous hormones presents significant regulatory challenges. Determination of the use of proscribed substances may involve setting threshold concentrations or defining acceptable ratios of different hormones. As more sophisticated techniques of abuse develop it may become necessary for regulatory programs to use increasingly invasive sampling techniques, to determine hormone profiles for individual athletes and even to undertake challenge tests which seek to differentiate endogenous from exogenous hormone production.",

There was no appreciable difference between the two campuses as to whether students had ever used it or, if so, when they first tried it, but the students from Wesleyan used it more heavily and more recently. Wesleyan students were more likely to have used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at some point and showed some tendency to have used it more recently, but did not differ significantly as to total cumulative use or the time they first tried it. For all hallucinogens, all users reported experiencing pleasant effects much more frequently than unpleasant effects.

In the literature, it is reported that butane inhalation directly affects central nervous system, respiratory and cardiovasculer systems. To prevent this increasing trend, we believe that society, especially youth, should be educated through precautionary educational activities, sales of lighter refill tubes should be monitored and be made age-restricted, and lighter refill tubes should have warning signs that everyone would understand and attract attention.

      "title": "SOLVENT SNIFFING",
      "abstract": "The vapors of a wide variety of organic solvents contained in such products as glues, paint thinner, fingernail polish removers, and cleaning and lighter fluids are being used by juveniles for the deliberate induction of intoxication. Such practices recently reached epidemic proportions in many areas of this country and, while the faddist aspect has now largely subsided, chronic \"sniffing\" appears to have emerged as a permanent and relatively common form of aberrant childhood behavior. Various observations of the problem suggest that sniffing provides a chemical escape from reality which is more adaptable, and therefore more readily accepted, by young children than are such other intoxicating practices as alcohol ingestion or the use of narcotic drugs. The greater adaptability of the former resides primarily in inexpensiveness, ease of concealment, and ease of procurement for supposedly legitimate purposes. The result is the development of dependence or habituation of youngsters at a far younger age than would otherwise be likely. The impression is gained that sniffing is the counterpart in the young child of the abuse of narcotics, alcohol, or LSD in older individuals. The pyschodynamics of this phenomenon, however, are not clear and there may be common factors underlying the widespread, recurrent use of or dependence on substances such as betel morsels, amphetamines, barbiturates, and even tobacco and caffeine (in coffee and tea). All of these result in a physiochemical modification of the sensorium, usually with a transient euphoric or stimulant effect. Attempts were made to characterize solvent sniffers and to assess the importance, potential dangers and the effectiveness of various control measures through original studies, a review of published data, and extensive discussion with others concerned with the problem. Among sniffers as among all juveniles apprehended by the police, there is a great preponderance of boys over girls, and the majority are in their early \"teens,\" although some are as young as 7 to 8 years of age. In areas of large Spanish-American population, members of this ethnic group comprise a disproportionately large share of sniffers, but it is noteworthy that Negroes seem definitely to be under-represented among sniffers, even in areas of very high Negro population. Although sniffers usually had prior histories of scholastic under achievement, intelligence per se bore little positive relation to the adoption of the habit. There was a definite relationship, however, to other modes of delinquency, of which most sniffers had long records. Perhaps surprisingly, such records tended not to include addictive behavior involving alcohol on narcotics, but repeated histories of exploring various solvent vapors for their intoxicating effects were usual. Among various psychosocial factors which might be considered etiologic, emotional deprivation was one which seemed to be frequently and regularly present. The intoxicating effects desired by sniffers can be produced by most volatile organic Solvents which are lipid-soluble. The popularity of some solvents is limited, however, because of undesirable properties, expense or difficulty of obtaining. The effects of solvent inhalation may often resemble those produced by alcohol, but there is a tendency for sniffing to be associated with greater impairment of judgment and reality perception. Thus, solvent vapor inhalation may lead to accident, violence, and the perpetration of various bizarre and antisocial acts. Repeated inhalation of large concentrations of vapors is associated with the development of striking tolerance and dependence, the latter often being accompanied by compulsion. Serious withdrawal symptoms, however, have been absent or rare and not at all like the intensity on pensistence of those associated with opium derivatives. That it may be the forerunner of alcoholism or narcotic addiction is perhaps implicit in the nature of the practice, but there is yet little evidence that one leads per se to the other. The toxic potential of solvent sniffing depends, of course, upon the constituents of the products employed. Some extremely dangerous solvents (e.g., carbon tetrachloride) which would not be popular among confirmed sniffers may be selected by the exploring novice or during periods of forced deprivation. Such eventualities aside, it remains unclean to what extent the more popular types of solvent sniffing (e.g., involving toluene or naphtha) are medically dangerous. In some studies, but not in others, sniffers of toluene have been found to have an abnormal incidence of vague neurological signs, hepatomegaly, eosinophilia, and, rarely, acute intracranical hypertension. The most consistent findings have been urinary abnormalities which appear to he transient; their ultimate significance, if any, is unknown at this point. Whether such findings reflect a transient, irritating effect of the chemical on the kidneys or a more destructive process capable of evolving into chronic incapacity remains to be determined. Legislation has been adopted, or proposed, in many cities and in several major states ill an attempt to control the problem, but its effectiveness remains open to question. Statutes aimed at restricting distribution (rather than abuse) of solvents is made difficult by the ubiquitousness of substances which can produce such effects. Thus, while a particular product (such as plastic cement) may be the current favorite, legislation aimed at it alone is not only discriminatory but may actually be harmful by forcing the use of alternate substances which are potentially more dangerous. Statutes aimed at abuses of the solvents (i.e., prohibition of inhalation with the intent of intoxication) provide a mechanism whereby offenders can be apprehended and, hopefully, subjected to treatment and may have some deterrent value. However, if interpreted literally they could be difficult to enforce and could technically be construed to prohibit alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine as well as \"glue.\" Individual and family treatment aimed at the underlying disorder offers the best hope of affecting a permanent cure of the habitué.",

      "abstract": "Smoking cessation aids appear to be limited in their ability to prevent craving triggered by exposure to smoking-associated stimuli; however, the extent to which cue-induced cravings persist following denicotinized or nicotine-containing tobacco smoking is not known.Thirty (17 male) ⩾12-hour abstinent dependent smokers completed two sessions during which they smoked a nicotine-containing or denicotinized cigarette. Instructions regarding the nicotine content of the cigarette varied across sessions, and all participants were exposed to a neutral cue followed by a smoking cue after cigarette consumption. Craving was assessed before and after cigarette consumption and cue exposure.Reduced intentions to smoke were associated with both nicotine expectancy (p<0.05) and nicotine administration (p<0.01), while reduced withdrawal-related craving was uniquely associated with nicotine administration (p<0.05). Smoking-associated stimuli increased craving regardless of nicotine expectancy or administration (p-values<0.001).While both nicotine pharmacology and expectancy appear to contribute to craving reduction associated with acute tobacco smoking, neither smoking-related nicotine administration nor expectation prevents increases in craving following exposure to smoking-associated stimuli. These findings suggest that cue-induced craving may be resistant to various pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

      "abstract": "Serious withdrawal symptoms in patients with alcoholism who undergo operation can be prevented or effectively treated by providing small amounts of alcohol throughout the withdrawal period. Delirium tremens is a potentially fatal symptom complex which may develop when a prolonged daily drinking pattern is interrupted by illness or injury. It was first described by Thomas Sutton in 1813. The withdrawal period is usually less than 72 hours but may be as long as ten days. It is not necessary to maintain a measurable blood level of alcohol for this therapy to be effective. Ten to 15 milliliters of ethanol given hourly, either orally or intravenously, is usually sufficient to prevent or control serious withdrawal symptoms.",

Terbukti dengan bertambahnya jumlah penyalahguna atau pecandu narkoba secara signifikan, seiring meningkatnya pengungkapan kasus tindak kejahatan narkoba yang semakin beragam polanya dan semakin masif pula jaringan sindikatnya. Masyarakat Indonesia, bahkan masyarakat dunia, pada umumnya saat ini sedang dihadapkan pada keadaan yang sangat mengkhawatirkan akibat maraknya pemakaian bermacam-macam jenis narkoba secara ilegal. Kekhawatiran ini semakin di pertajam akibat maraknya peredaran gelap narkotika yang telah merebak di segala lapisan masyarakat, termasuk di kalangan generasi muda. Hal ini akan sangat berpengaruh terhadap kehidupan bangsa dan negara pada masa mendatang. Perilaku sebagian remaja yang secara nyata telah jauh mengabaikan nilai-nilai kaidah dan norma serta hukum yang berlaku di tengah kehidupan masyarakat menjadi salah satu penyebab maraknya penggunaan narkoba di kalangan generasi muda. Dalam kehidupan sehari-hari di tengah-tengah masyarakat masih banyak dijumpai remaja yang masih melakukan penyalahgunaan narkoba.",

A combination of reduced fluid intake, physical activity and drug-induced hyperthermia leads to complications such as heat stroke, delirium and potentially death. The clinician needs to be aware of the variety of pharmacologically active substances available in the recreational marketplace in order to diagnose and manage these patients. Recreational misadventure, because of incorrect dosage or mixing multiple substances, is a common reason for teenagers presenting to hospital with toxidromes. Death from club drug overdose is more likely to be associated with suicidal intent, related risky behaviour and trauma, as well as the inherent toxicity of the drug itself. Although many teenagers are concerned about 'drink spiking' with club drugs, the most common agent causing drink spiking incidents is ethanol.",

Medication can cause constipation by slowing peristaltic contractions in the bowel. Environmental factors affecting constipation include the height of the toilet which affects the ability to have both feet on the floor to aid emptying of the rectum, lack of privacy, and seating comfort on the toilet. Using commodes at the bedside can cause people to hold on to faeces for fear of making a smell or sound. Some patients ignore the rectal sensation because of difficulty with mobility or because carers are not available at the right time. The longer the stool remains in the rectum the more water content is reabsorbed resulting in a harder stool.",

      "title": "Continuous nicotine exposure does not affect resurgence of alcohol seeking in rats",
      "abstract": "Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the United States and alcohol abuse can lead to alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use disorder is a persistent condition and relapse rates following successful remission are high. Many factors have been associated with relapse for alcohol use disorder, but identification of these factors has not been well translated into preventative utility. One potentially important factor, concurrent nicotine use, has not been well investigated as a causal factor in relapse for alcohol use disorder. Nicotine increases the value of other stimuli in the environment and may increase the value of alcohol. If nicotine increases the value of alcohol, then nicotine use during and after treatment may make relapse more probable. In the current study, we investigated the effect of continuous nicotine exposure (using osmotic minipumps to deliver nicotine or saline, depending on group, at a constant rate for 28 days) on resurgence of alcohol seeking in rats. Resurgence is a type of relapse preparation that consists of three phases: Baseline, Alternative Reinforcement, and Resurgence Testing. During Baseline, target responses produced a dipper of alcohol. During Alternative Reinforcement, target responses were extinguished and responses on a chain produced a chocolate pellet. During Resurgence Testing, responses on the chain were also extinguished and a return to responding on the target lever was indicative of resurgence. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the effect of nicotine on resurgence. Both the nicotine and saline group showed resurgence of alcohol seeking, but there was no difference in the degree of resurgence across groups. Future directions could involve testing alternative drug delivery techniques.",

Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours. Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache, drowsiness, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea), absence of hunger, light sensitivity, depression, sweating, nausea, hyperexcitability, irritability, and anxiety. Hangovers are rough. And the more you drink the night before, the more severe your hangover symptoms might feel the morning after. Most of the time you just need to drink water, eat some food, and walk it off. But if you’ve had too much to drink, you may be harming your body and need to see your doctor for treatment. Let’s look at how to tell the difference between a mild, temporary hangover that you can treat at home and one that may need some extra medical attention. Each of these 10 common symptoms stems from a physiological response to the presence of alcohol in your digestive and urinary systems, especially your stomach, kidneys, and bloodstream.",

Many alcohol related problems are irreversible once established and thus it is imperative that information be made available to the public and to health care workers to help minimise problems before they become permanently established. It is suggested that harm may be minimised by a number of strategies that include measures to: 1. Prevent the desire or need to drink excessively. 2. Prevent the ingestion of excessive amounts of alcohol. 3. Prevent the effects of excessive intake by protecting susceptible tissues. 4. Treating tissue damage early to prevent progressive injury.

      "abstract": "Obesity is epidemic and dangerous. Weight loss is difficult but worth the effort. Although new weight-loss drugs are available, there are no magic bullets: to lose weight and keep it off, people must eat less and exercise more. This article presents a practical approach on how physicians can help their patients lose weight through diet, behavior modification, and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy. An appropriate initial goal is to lose 5% to 10% of one's baseline weight over 3 to 6 months. Drug therapy should not be used in isolation, but it can be an adjunct to diet, exercise, and behavior modification if a patient is committed and able to make necessary changes in eating and activity, and if the patient has a BMI of 30 or higher or a BMI greater than 27 with weight-related comorbid conditions. Anorectic therapy is unlikely to succeed and should be stopped if the patient does not lose at least 4 lb in the first 4 weeks of therapy. Orlistat is unlikely to be of benefit if patients do not lose at least 3% of their baseline weight by 12 weeks. Because obesity is a chronic disease, drug treatment should be continued indefinitely. The physician and patient must understand the intention to treat long-term. The weight loss plan devised should improve upon previous plans: for example, implementing a regular, convenient exercise program that had not been included in the past, or offering pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Position Statement: The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) bases the following position stand on a critical analysis of the literature on the safety and efficacy of the use of energy drinks (ED) or energy shots (ES). The ISSN has concluded the following. 1. Although ED and ES contain a number of nutrients that are purported to affect mental and/or physical performance, the primary ergogenic nutrients in most ED and ES appear to be carbohydrate and/or caffeine. 2. The ergogenic value of caffeine on mental and physical performance has been well-established but the potential additive benefits of other nutrients contained in ED and ES remains to be determined. 3. Consuming ED 10-60 minutes before exercise can improve mental focus, alertness, anaerobic performance, and/or endurance performance. 4. Many ED and ES contain numerous ingredients; these products in particular merit further study to demonstrate their safety and potential effects on physical and mental performance. 5. There is some limited evidence that consumption of low-calorie ED during training and/or weight loss trials may provide ergogenic benefit and/or promote a small amount of additional fat loss. However, ingestion of higher calorie ED may promote weight gain if the energy intake from consumption of ED is not carefully considered as part of the total daily energy intake. 6. Athletes should consider the impact of ingesting high glycemic load carbohydrates on metabolic health, blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as the effects of caffeine and other stimulants on motor skill performance. 7. Children and adolescents should only consider use of ED or ES with parental approval after consideration of the amount of carbohydrate, caffeine, and other nutrients contained in the ED or ES and a thorough understanding of the potential side effects. 8. Indiscriminant use of ED or ES, especially if more than one serving per day is consumed, may lead to adverse events and harmful side effects. 9. Diabetics and individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatorenal, and neurologic disease who are taking medications that may be affected by high glycemic load foods, caffeine, and/or other stimulants should avoid use of ED and/or ES unless approved by their physician.",

      "abstract": "“Snus” consist of loose ground tobacco in a very small tea bag–like pouch, placed behind the upper gum for up to 30 minutes. With a different curing process and in the absence of combustion, several carcinogens are reduced, if not eliminated. Epidemiological studies in Sweden, where snus were developed and adopted by approximately 20% of males, have found few, if any, increases in oral/head cancers or cardiovascular risks. Although snus are considerably safer than cigarettes from the perspective of an individual smoker, from a broader societal perspective, at least three problems suggest the need for regulatory oversight: (1) Snus could serve as a “gateway” product for adolescents; (2) snus could serve as a temporary bridge/replacement product for smokers in situations in which cigarettes cannot be used, thus dampening their motivation to quit smoking; and (3) studies have found potentially heightened risks of pancreatic cancer, premature birth, dental disease, and oral lesions among users.",

Accordingly, numerous approaches have been developed and studied that aim to prevent underage drinking. Some approaches are school based, involving curricula targeted at preventing alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana use. Other approaches are extracurricular, offering activities outside of school in the form of social or life skills training or alternative activities. Other strategies strive to involve the adolescents' families in the prevention programs. Policy strategies also have been implemented that have increased the minimum legal drinking age, reduced the commercial and social access of adolescents to alcohol, and reduced the economic availability of alcohol. Approaches involving the entire community also have been employed. Several programs (e.g., the Midwestern Prevention Project and Project Northland) have combined many of these strategies.",

Because smoking cessation requires self-control, it was hypothesized that a treatment that builds self-control should help in quitting smoking. A total of 122 smokers either practiced small acts of self-control for 2 weeks before quitting smoking or practiced a task that increased their awareness of self-control or feelings of confidence, without exercising self-control. Their smoking status was assessed using daily telephone calls and biochemically verified. Individuals who practiced self-control remained abstinent longer than those who practiced tasks that did not require self-control. Supplemental analyses suggested that the increased survival times were a product of building self-control strength and were not produced by changes in feelings that practicing should help in cessation, effort exerted on the practice task, or thinking more about self-control while practicing.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a period in the life of an individual from 10 years to 19 years of age. This stage is marked by rapid physical, cognitive, and psychosocial growth in an individual and is a very crucial stage for their development. This is the time when the foundations of a healthy or unhealthy lifestyle are laid, and these habits may continue for a lifetime. Current research studies show high growth in the number of adolescents involved in risky behaviors, and this has become a matter of concern. The prevalence of risks in alcohol and tobacco consumption has increased tremendously. Tobacco and alcohol are known to be ‘gateway drugs’ as they are the first to be consumed when an individual starts such practices; the reasons are their easy availability, peer influences, acculturation, or even family history of substance use disorder. To decrease this and establish a healthy lifestyle, teenagers need proper information and guidance, including opportunities that may lead them to actively participate in interventions that are aimed to improve their physical and mental health. Mostly, alcohol and tobacco are seen to be prevalent together. Adolescents who show consistent drinking and tobacco smoking habits are more likely to show irritant, violent behaviors. Also, they are at higher risk of developing drug habits like marijuana abuse in their later stages of life.This chapter basically examines the generality of tobacco and alcohol consumption, especially among adolescents, and the ways in which it causes harm to adolescents and its side effects. It gives an overview of the social, physical, and psychological effects it has on adolescents’ lifestyles. It also covers risk factors and smoking and alcohol cessation efforts in the population. It gives special consideration to smoking cessation treatment, which includes peer influences, motivation, and nicotine dependence.",

Ne kryem një përmbledhje të rishikimeve sistematike për të vlerësuar efektivitetin e ndërhyrjeve për të parandaluar abuzimin me substancat tek adoleshentët. Ne raportojmë gjetje nga një total prej 26 rishikimesh sistematike që fokusohen në ndërhyrjet për pirjen e duhanit/përdorimin e duhanit, përdorimin e alkoolit, përdorimin e drogës dhe abuzimin e kombinuar të substancave. Gjetjet tona të përmbledhjes sugjerojnë se midis ndërhyrjeve për pirjen e duhanit/duhanit, programet parandaluese të bazuara në shkollë dhe ndërhyrjet intensive të bazuara në familje, që zakonisht trajtojnë funksionimin e familjes, janë efektive në reduktimin e pirjes së duhanit.

      "title": "Playing with Propranolol",
      "abstract": "When an anxiety-reducing drug with virtually no side effects is used to enhance performance, is that cheating? Is it drug abuse? Is it an admission of professional weakness? During a series of three performances, a trumpet player in a professional orchestra consistently plays a difficult solo passage flawlessly each time. Her colleague in trumpet section marvels at her ability to play so well, since he knows that he and other professional players are unlikely ever to play that particular passage with consistent perfection. His assessment of his colleague's luck and talent changes, however, when he learns she takes ten milligrams of drug propranolol before each performance that requires her to play difficult solo passages. Although many people will agree on what constitutes ethical and unethical use of certain types of drugs, some kinds of drug use do not fit easily into either category. The patient who demands an antibiotic for a viral head cold, athlete who requests steroids to enhance his or her performance, or child who receives growth hormone injections because of a perceived social advantage to being tall present instances of drug use that are difficult to evaluate from a moral perspective. Propranolol for performance anxiety represents another instance of ethical ambiguity in regard to drug use. The reason for such ambiguity is that ethical evaluation of drug use is shaped by cultural beliefs and values, many of which lie hidden in commonsensical, unquestioned assumptions we make about our world. These implicit meanings, when they surface, often are in form of vague images and incompletely articulated ideas. Furthermore, cultural images may have competing and contradictory meanings that add to ambiguity of a moral evaluation of drugs and their use. Propranolol use by musicians is an interesting case study for several reasons. It is a drug that can enhance one's performance and may increase one's advantage in competitive field of performing arts. As such, its use gives rise to moral questions similar to those raised by use of steroids by athletes, such as fairness, or harm to individual.[1] In addition, ambiguity about meaning of performance anxiety and propranolol use complicates moral issues. Is performance anxiety a normal phenomenon, as most musicians believe? At what point does it become pathological? Does fact that physicians prescribe propranolol to treat performance anxiety confer upon it status of disease? Or does fact that musicians often obtain this prescription drug from their friends and take it before any important performance constitute simply another form of drug abuse? Propranolol and Performance Anxiety Performance anxiety, or stage fright, has been defined as the experience of persisting, distressful apprehension about and/or actual impairment of, performance skills in a public context, to a degree unwarranted given individual's musical aptitude, training, and level of preparation.[2] Propranolol is a prescription drug increasingly used by symphony and opera musicians to eliminate symptoms of performance anxiety. The drug was first introduced for treatment of angina pectoris, and later used to treat cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension and to prevent sudden death after myocardial infarction. Propranolol use was later extended to treat migraine headaches and symptoms of anxiety associated with stress.[3] When a person is under stress, sympathetic nervous system produces adrenaline-like chemicals that attach to beta-adrenergic receptor sites of body. These sites produce physiological responses in heart rate, skeletal muscles, blood vessels, and bronchioles of lungs and, in essence, prepare body for a fight or flight reaction. Propranolol and other beta-blocking drugs compete with adrenaline-like chemicals for these sites on cells and block their physiological effects. …",

      "title": "A–Z of nutritional supplements: dietary supplements, sports nutrition foods and ergogenic aids for health and performance—Part 22",
      "abstract": "Practitioners who work with elite athletes know that the pressure and considerable rewards involved with success provide a high level of motivation to look for any safe and legal strategy that might enhance performance, even by small margins. Dietary supplements operate in this space, whether they promise a large performance boost or just create the fear that an athlete cannot afford to miss out on what everyone else is using. It is often tempting to overlook the lack of evidence to support the claims made about a supplement on the basis that the stakes are higher for elite athletes; therefore the cost:benefit ratio favours experimentation in the absence of clear proof. Over the past decade, however, we have become aware that the cost of getting it wrong has also escalated for elite athletes. A new hazard related to supplement use has emerged: inadvertent ingestion of substances that are banned under the antidoping codes in place in elite sport, but present in supplement products. In some cases, the level of the presence, or contamination, of banned substances in supplements presents a health hazard for all consumers. In some cases, the concentration may be too small to achieve any health or performance effect but large enough to record an infringement for athletes who submit to doping tests. Newspapers, the internet and Courts of Arbitration in Sport now bear stories of dedicated athletes whose careers have been or are being jeopardised because of the ingestion of a banned substance via a dietary supplement. This problem was first brought to scientific recognition by Hans Geyer and his colleagues from the Centre for Preventive Doping Research in Cologne. The following article provides an update of a recent review by this team.1\n\n\n\nIn the past years, an increasing number of dietary supplements containing undeclared doping …",

      "abstract": "Australia has one of the highest rates in the world of the use of the crystalline form of methamphetamine, a highly addictive stimulant that is often associated with a chronic, relapsing dependency. Methamphetamine use is associated with both acquisitive and violent offending, which cause substantial personal and societal costs. Whilst the short-term euphoria and stimulation provide a positive reinforcement to methamphetamine use, the aversive states of withdrawing from methamphetamine and the associated craving, which may last up to five weeks into abstinence, underlie the negative reinforcement to continued methamphetamine use. Although many methamphetamine-dependent users experience high levels of psychological distress, it is likely that less than half engage with treatment or support services, and current intervention and treatment programmes have high discontinuation rates. Stigma and discrimination, even from paramedics and health clinicians, are prominent barriers to methamphetamine-dependent users accessing treatment in Australia.",

      "title": "Alcohol and Breastfeeding, a review of the issues",
      "abstract": "Moderate alcohol use by breastfeeding women appears to be relatively common. Alcohol concentrates in breast milk at levels slightly higher than in maternal blood, peaking at 30-60 minutes after consumption. Most studies find no link with the duration of breastfeeding unless drinking is fairly heavy (&gt;2 standard drinks/day). However, seven studies have found that moderate maternal alcohol consumption was associated with a shorter duration of exclusive breastfeeding; one found no difference and one found an increase. Alcohol affects oxytocin release, leading to reductions in breast milk consumption in the following hours. Infant alcohol exposure may increase fussiness and reduce sleep, both temporary if the mother does not continue to drink. These effects on the infant and on the breastfeeding process could be interpreted by mothers as signs of infant dissatisfaction with their breast milk, “insufficient milk,” or other commonly expressed causes for suboptimal breastfeeding patterns. Chronic alcohol consumption, even if moderate, may have a number of more serious effects, including on infant development. In the early weeks or months of life, infant toleration of alcohol is lower than it is at later stages of infancy, and the early breastfeeding process is more susceptible to disruption. Therefore, it may be wise to advise mothers to continue their abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy into the first few months of breastfeeding. Little research has been done on how often women time their drinking so as to avoid infant exposure to alcohol. Health workers and others sometimes propagate myths that alcohol, especially alcoholic beer, is beneficial to breastfeeding. Research is needed in different cultures into whether various forms of cautionary messages are likely to discourage moderate drinkers from initiating breastfeeding or to shorten its duration, and which type of messages if any actually lead to a reduction in drinking during breastfeeding.",

A partial explanation can be found in an investigation of the relative meaning of the drug for the addict within his social context rather than viewing the drug simply as a pharmacological agent. The idea that addiction is a social phenomenon within the addicts family suggests a relationship between the functioning of the families of addicts and their inability to tolerate abstinence. Because the abuse of heroin or barbiturates by one family member can result in \"rewards\" for all family members, the family, in behaving as if the addict cannot control his drug use, functions in such a way as to reinforce the addiction.",

Sixty‐four adolescents calling a cocaine hotline received structured telephone interviews. Mean age was 16.7 years. Two‐thirds of the adolescents were young men. Sixty‐six percent used alcohol; 60.9%, marijuana; 60.9%, cocaine; mean onset was at 13.57, 13.28, and 14.64 years, respectively.

      "title": "Nicotine Craving and Withdrawal: Impact of Cigarette Smoke Constituents and Age",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Reynaga, Daisy Dalila | Advisor(s): Leslie, Frances | Abstract: Smoking continues to be one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States. Although the majority of smokers want to quit, most will not be successful at doing so. Despite extensive research and funding devoted to finding more efficacious pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation, current therapies are not very effective at keeping smokers abstinent for over a year. The goal of my dissertation was to establish a preclinical test that would have better face validity for the development of new pharmacological therapies for smoking cessation. Current preclinical tests of tobacco dependence use nicotine alone. Here I used an aqueous cigarette smoke extract (CSE), which contains nicotine and many other constituents of cigarette smoke, to examine its effects on cue- and drug-induced craving, factors known to influence relapse. The hypothesis that was tested was that CSE would induce greater craving and withdrawal than nicotine alone. Adult male rats that had self-administered CSE were found to reinstate to drug priming alone, unlike animals that had self-administered nicotine, which required the additional presentation of drug-associated cues. AT-1001, a functional α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, attenuated drug-primed reinstatement of CSE- and nicotine-seeking behavior. However, AT-1001 was less potent in blocking drug-primed reinstatement in animals that had self-administered CSE than in those that had self-administered nicotine alone. This was the case even when nicotine alone was used to prime reinstatement in animals that had self-administered CSE, suggesting that prior CSE exposure had altered the functional role of this nAChR.Another factor known to influence relapse is withdrawal to smoking. Teenagers are especially vulnerable to the effects of withdrawal. However, although adult rats show many of the same signs of withdrawal as humans following chronic nicotine exposure, adolescent rodents do not. In this study, adolescent and adult male rats were exposed for ten days to nicotine or CSE (1.5 mg/kg/day nicotine equivalent) by intravenous injection. Chronic CSE treatment resulted in greater spontaneous somatic and affective withdrawal symptoms in both adolescent and adult rats. Furthermore, adolescents treated chronically with CSE displayed major affective symptoms, as shown by an increase in anxiety-like behavior 30 days after drug withdrawal. Mecamylamine, a non-selective nAChR antagonist, was used to investigate if nAChRs are involved in the enhancement of withdrawal observed following chronic CSE treatment. Whereas mecamylamine precipitated greater somatic withdrawal in animals treated with CSE, it did not precipitate affective withdrawal. Heavy smokers show an upregulation of nAChR through increased radioligand binding. Similarly, adult rodents show an upregulation of nAChR binding after chronic nicotine, adolescents do not. Since CSE exposure resulted in an increase in precipitated somatic withdrawal in adult and adolescent rats and also augmented nicotine-primed reinstatement, I hypothesized that chronic CSE exposure would result in enhanced nAChR binding in both adult and adolescent rats. Chronic CSE exposure results in enhanced α4β2, α3β4, and α7 nAChR binding regardless of age, in brain areas highly involved in negative aversive states of addiction. Overall, this work provides evidence that the cigarette smoke constituents influence drug-primed craving, withdrawal, and changes in nAChR properties. Smoke constituents eliminated the protective effects that adolescent rodents display in preclinical tests of nicotine dependence, and enhanced both craving and withdrawal in adults. These findings suggest that use of CSE is a more valid way to study tobacco dependence than nicotine, and should be used in preclinical tests to assess tobacco cessation therapies.",

      "abstract": "Craving, which ranges from a sustained desire for drugs persisting for week to an acute desire passing within minutes, has been described as an important clinical precipitant of relapse in cocaine and opioid abusers and may be a useful surrogate outcome for developing new drug abuse pharmacotherapies. Whereas craving for opioids frequently has been conceptualized as the negative reinforcer of protracted withdrawal or “drug hunger,” craving for cocaine has been conceptualized as the positive reinforcer of remembered euphoria. Medications can reduce both sustained cocaine craving and acute craving induced by a single dose of cocaine, and reductions in both types of craving are correlated with reductions in cocaine use. Furthermore, high level of craving during treatment or during cue-induced challenges predict poor treatment response and later relapse to cocaine abuse in those who have attained abstinence.",

      "title": "Consequences of concurrent and simultaneous amphetamine-type stimulant and alcohol use among young adults: hazardous drinking, antisocial behaviour, and contact with police",
      "abstract": "Background: Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) include ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) and methamphetamine and are the second most widely used illicit drugs in Australia, following cannabis. ATS use is most common among young adults aged 20-29 years, who often use these substances recreationally in leisure settings (e.g., nightclubs, pubs, bars, raves, music festivals, and parties). Prior research indicates that alcohol and illicit stimulants, such as ATS, are often combined in nightlife entertainment districts in the context of a big night out. The combined use of these substances represents an emerging area of concern, as evidence suggests that their combined use may result in greater harms than their separate use, including increased neurotoxicity, hazardous alcohol consumption, and aggression. However, despite the prevalence of ATS use among young adults and its use in settings in which alcohol is also prevalent, knowledge of community patterns of combined alcohol and ATS use is limited and research examining the potential consequences of combined use is scarce.Objectives: This thesis examines consequences of concurrent and simultaneous alcohol and ATS use among a population-based sample of young adult ATS users, focusing on: hazardous alcohol consumption, aggression, and contact with police.Methods: Data for this study are drawn from the Natural History Study of Drug Use (NHSDU), a prospective longitudinal study of drug use among a population-based sample of young adult ATS users and non-users in South-East Queensland, Australia. A brief drug use screening questionnaire was mailed to 12,079 young adults (aged 19-23 years) randomly selected from the Brisbane and Gold Coast electoral rolls, with a response rate of 49.9%. From this screening data, a sampling frame was developed from which an ATS-user group (used ecstasy or methamphetamine ≥3 times within the last 12 months, n=352) and a comparison group of non-users (random selection of the young adults who had never used ecstasy or methamphetamine at the time of screening, n=204) were recruited.Key findings: Study findings showed that alcohol use was prevalent among these young adult ATS users and was often used in combination with ATS. At the study baseline, 96.5% of ATS users had consumed alcohol in the last month and 92.9% of ecstasy users and 80.7% of methamphetamine users usually consumed alcohol during ecstasy and methamphetamine use episodes, respectively. Heavy episodic drinking was also common among ATS users, with 56.9% of female ATS users and 77.9% of male ATS users usually consuming >4 standard drinks on days of drinking at baseline. Findings indicated ecstasy use may play a role in the high rates of heavy episodic drinking among these young adults, with concurrent ecstasy use – though not concurrent methamphetamine use – associated with these hazardous patterns of alcohol consumption. While not associated with hazardous drinking, combined alcohol and methamphetamine use was shown to play a role in aggressive behaviour. Patterns of simultaneous alcohol and methamphetamine use were associated with both methamphetamine-attributed subjective feelings of aggression or hostility and acts of verbal and physical aggression while under the influence of illicit drugs. Lastly, for these young adults, engagement in illicit drug use, hazardous drinking, and antisocial behaviour likely puts them at an increased risk of contact with police. Findings showed that ATS users were more likely than non-using young adults to have experienced substance-related police contact and were more likely to have experienced more intensive police contact. Additionally, these findings suggest that police contact may impact on both substance use behaviours and perceptions of police and policing.Conclusions: This thesis extends current knowledge of community patterns of combined alcohol and ATS use and the potential consequences for young adults. Results highlighted that combined alcohol and ATS use is ubiquitous among these young adults. Further, this research indicates that the combined use of alcohol and ATS is associated with a number of concerning outcomes, including hazardous alcohol consumption, aggression, and contact with police, which have both health and social implications. Specifically, these findings suggest that young adult ATS users may be a key target group for alcohol interventions. Further, the policy challenges of alcohol, ATS use, and aggression among young adults need to be better considered in relation to the interlinking of these issues.",

Anit-drug messages may have influenced light users, whose use has dropped, but not heavy users; one in five Indian youth use drugs other than marijuana, a rate constant since 1981. Drug use is linked neither to emotional distress nor acculturation stress. It is related to peer drug associations, although less strongly than in Anglo youth, and is linked more directly than in Anglo youth to family influence. Root causes may be poverty, prejudice, and lack of social, educational and economic opportunity on reservations.",

The health effects caused by the use of Ephedra products are mainly restlessness, agitation, tachycardia and palpitations. The most important risk factors are the relatively high amounts of Ephedra alkaloids in the preparations available, the varying concentrations within different batches of the same product, the relatively high risk of voluntary overdosing in order to improve results and the occurrence of interactions with the concurrent use of other stimulants and medicines.",

You discover that she is smoking 20 cigarettes a day, and she is worried that she went to a friend’s wedding around the time of conception and drank so much that she couldn’t remember what had happened until the next day. She also reports occasional recreational use of cannabis.\n\n#### Next steps\n\nAdvise her of the risks of smoking and of alcohol and cannabis use during pregnancy. The biggest risk for her pregnancy at present is her smoking.\n\nOffer referral to a specialist pregnancy smoking cessation clinic.\n\nClarify with her how much cannabis and alcohol she is using. Brief intervention may be sufficient, but regular or heavy use of either substance may warrant referral to specialist drug and alcohol services.\n\nMany women use substances during pregnancy. For example, the global prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is 9.8%.1 Moreover, 10.4% of pregnant women in England were known to be smoking tobacco at the time of delivery.2 Prevalence of cannabis use during pregnancy in a UK cohort has been reported as 5%3 but is likely to increase over coming years.4 Pregnancy may be a woman’s first time engaging with health services and may be a motivator to stop or reduce her substance use.5 In this article we offer an overview of assessment and interventions for substance use in the perinatal period.

      "abstract": "Abstract Consumption of drugs by human beings has had a long history, extending millennia before the first written accounts of wine consumption or the smoking of opium. Because drugs take so many different forms and are consumed in so many different ways, the most inclusive definition of “drug” is desirable. Alcohol is certainly a component of human drug repertoires, and archaeological evidence indicates that it is one of the most ancient of plant‐derived drugs. Human trends in drug consumption have moved in the direction of increasing purity and potency of plant‐derived preparations, for example, distilled spirits that evolved from fermented brews of grape juice, malt water, or corn mash. Concepts of drug abuse and drug dependence emerged as potent preparations gained popularity and established perceptions of chronic intoxication. Both of these terms appear aimed at denoting consumers of drugs who are not necessarily addicted to them. “Drug abuse” and “alcohol abuse” have become parts of the names of two national agencies in the United States dedicated to the study of drug‐using patterns. “Drug dependence” denotes a condition similar to addiction but without the additional stigma of vulnerability to withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "There are multiple barriers to better understanding of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches and the use of natural substances to reduce cancer risk. CAM approaches are not patentable, and the pharmaceutical industry has no interest in the area. Research generally approaches concepts from the deconstructionist side: there may be interest in herbal mixtures but its \"active\" constituents are explored one at a time, missing any synergistic or even additive effects. Little attention has been paid to environmental pollutants and exposures. Most patients believe these are active causes of their disease, but researchers are still exposing animals to one chemical one time, which fails to duplicate human exposures. Attention to lifestyle issues is presented almost solely in terms of obesity--a concept that is a barrier to change by itself. Research animals rarely if ever are fed dietary components that humans normally eat, such as soda or diet soda, potato chips, and high-fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, artificial flavors, other additives, or combinations of bad fats with too much sugar, too much salt, and artificial ingredients. Long-term treatment effects on survivors may not necessarily require a solely pharmaceutical approach. Drugs to treat each condition separately may require even more drugs to offset the unwanted effects of each. Whole systems approaches to research are urgently needed. A final barrier is that once a treatment is accepted in mainstream, it ceases to be considered \"alternative.\" The genesis is soon forgotten and the remaining alternative modalities continue to be viewed with suspicion, doubt, and misunderstanding, to the detriment of both patients in treatment and cancer survivors.",

The chemical analysis of tobacco smoke, while suggestive, does not in itself prove anything about the long-term effects of smoking. Some chemicals which are highly toxic in large doses are harmless or even beneficial in small doses. Other substances may be practically harmless in a single large dose but cause serious damage after pro longed exposure to relatively small doses. Furthermore, there are some factors which seem to have little or no effect on healthy individuals but which have deleterious effects on patients suffering from certain diseases. As scientists, I think we would all agree that the ideal way to determine the long-term effects of smoking would be to set up a well-controlled experiment on human beings. It should start when the subjects are in their teens and continue until the last one dies of old age. Unfortunately, this is a bit impractical for numerous reasons. For example, it would be quite impossible for the investigator to maintain the same degree of control over human subjects as over laboratory animals. For these reasons, many studies have been made to ascertain what happens to people who of their own volition have smoked for many years. Perhaps the least satisfactory has been the study of time trend associations. As shown on Figure 1, a tremendous increase has occurred in the reported death rate from lung cancer. In this country, the age standardized rate for white males rose from about 0.7 per 100,000 in 1914 to 28.4 per 100,000 in 1956. This led to the hypothesis that a corresponding increase must have occurred in one or more factors responsible for lung cancer, probably some substance inhaled into the lungs. Concurrently, a decrease occurred in three other lung diseases: tuberculosis, influenza, and pneumonia. Coal soot, dust from asphalt highways, motor vehicle exhaust fumes, fumes from fuel oil, and cigarette smoke have been suspect in relation",

      "abstract": "Button batteries can be lethal if ingested and not promptly excreted or removed.These batteries are present in a multitude of household items including car remotes, IT devices, and many consumer items targeted at children.There are various technologies available for button batteries and they are produced in various sizes.Lithium button batteries with a diameter of 20mm or more pose the greatest risk.Most at risk are children of 0-5 years.At this age, there is a propensity to put foreign objects in the mouth.These batteries once swallowed, rather than passing through the alimentary canal and being excreted, may lodge in the oesophagus where they will burn through tissue, sometimes trough to the trachea, sometimes through to the aorta.This will be fatal for the child if the problem is not promptly identified and the battery then promptly extracted.Death will follow within several weeks of ingestion, following episodes of ill health, if the problem is not recognised.The presenting symptoms of ill health by the child can be misdiagnosed as food poisoning, a virus, an infection, or some common malady.Three child deaths in Australia from ingested button batteries (all 20mm lithium) are reported in the present paper.In each case, after prior misdiagnoses, the ingested battery was detected by X-ray, and, in each case, too late for successful intervention.Ingested button batteries can be detected by X-ray or ultrasound, but they may be indistinguishable from an ingested coin, which present less risk and are not actively corrosive.A new safety standard in Australia seeks to reduce the access of children to button batteries.The standard accepts the design status quo of button batteries, and seeks to avoid their misuse, in particular to stop them being ingested by young children.This is a safety-by-regulation approach.The alternative is a safety-by-design approach where the onus is on product designers to engineer safety into and danger out of the product.The twin problems of lithium button batteries are, firstly, their size where they are small enough to be easily swallowed by children but large enough to lodge in the oesophagus (where they are ≥20mm in diameter), and secondly, their bio -reactivity with flesh, which is partly a matter of chemistry but also partly a matter of the surface areas of the electrodes (which are extensive surfaces rather than point electrodes).",

      "abstract": "Many methods have been used to assist the individual to discontinue cigarette smoking. A limited measure of success has been obtained by means of educational campaigns, psychotherapy, or pharmacological aids. Combinations of these therapeutic methods in smoking treatment clinics have produced only temporary alteration of cigarette-smoking habits. Review of the accumulated experience to date suggests that further development of methods for terminating the cigarette habit should include emphasis on the psychological and social factors which perpetuate the habit, reinforcement of the habit of \"not smoking\" for at least two years, and elevation of smoking treatments on the basis of long-term results.",

      "abstract": "De mondgezondheid van (top)sporters is slechter dan die van vergelijkbare niet-sporters. Een van de oorzaken hiervan is monddroogte. Intensieve sportbeoefening veroorzaakt op verschillende manieren monddroogte. Door intensief sporten stijgt de lichaamstemperatuur tot boven de 39 graden. Dit gaat gepaard met transpireren, wat leidt tot verlies van water en zouten. Wanneer die niet worden aangevuld, treedt uitdroging op, wat gepaard gaat met een dorstgevoel, een droge mond en een lagere speekselproductie. Ten tweede veroorzaakt mondademhaling tijdens intensief sporten een gevoel van monddroogte. Ten derde veroorzaakt sportbeoefening een toename van de eiwit- en slijmproductie. Dit leidt tot dik, slijmerig speeksel, wat ook een droog gevoel kan geven. Naast de sport zelf veroorzaken diverse prestatiebevorderende middelen zoals amfetaminen, diuretica en astmamedicijnen een droge mond. Monddroogte maakt sporters gevoeliger voor caries en tanderosie. Daarom is de consumptie van sportdranken, die zuur en suiker bevatten, niet aan te bevelen tijdens het sporten.",

      "abstract": "Case: A 16‐year‐old patient is referred for major depressive disorder and cannabis use disorder (CUD). In the past year, she has been smoking marijuana three to five times per day, every day. Over the same year, her grades have declined and her relationship with her family has been strained in the context of increased cannabis use. Sertraline was started 4 months ago for depression and has been dosed at 200 mg daily for the past month. Her family notes improvement in sleep, concentration and mood with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The patient describes using marijuana, “because it's the only thing that has worked for my anxiety and made me not care about my depression.” She describes craving marijuana every day, especially when she smells marijuana on her clothes, smells marijuana on someone else, hears a song on the radio that she has enjoyed while high, or sees images of people smoking on TV. She doesn't intend to stop smoking altogether, but she doesn't want to feel like she needs to smoke every day. She has a history of occasional alcohol use (less than once a month) and occasional cigarettes (less than five per week).",

Drug-taking is one of the more widespread of human activities. The use, possession or sale of certain kinds of drugs, taking drugs in certain contexts, or the ingestion of drugs for disapproved motives, have been regarded as crimes in nearly all countries, punished with a fine or imprisonment of the offender. Drugs are commonly categorized on the basis of their impact on the central nervous system – the brain and spinal cord. In parts of India, for example, holy men smoke cannabis to quell their appetite for food and sex; in the West, the same drug is successfully used to enhance precisely the same appetites. The treatment of psychotic disorders, mainly schizophrenia, with the use of anti-psychotic drugs such as Thorazine, has been increasing dramatically since their discovery in the 1950s.",

      "title": "FOOD–DRUG INTERACTION AND THEIR CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: SELECTED INVESTIGATIONS",
      "abstract": "Food-drug interactions occur as a result of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics mechanisms. Pharmacokinetic mechanisms include what the body does to a drug while Pharmacodynamics mechanisms involve what drugs do to the body. Many types of food have been shown to influence metabolism and the absorption of drugs. Large numbers of drugs are produced and introduced yearly. The interaction between Food and drug may cause negative effects in the nutritional status of the patient as well as safety and efficacy of drug therapy. Due to the possibility of unexpected or poor outcomes, generally, food-drug interactions, in this case, should be avoided. As the good clinical practice, drugs taken by mouth must be absorbed either through the lining of the stomach or the small intestine. Reduction in the absorbance of a drug might be influenced by the presence of food in the digestive tract. The avoidance of such interactions could be possible if the drug is taken 1 hour before or 2 h after eating the food. The effects of several types of food such as milk or milk products, grapefruit and grapefruit juice, bananas, oranges, legumes, fermented meats and pickled fish and some nutrient elements such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and vitamin K are highlighted in this paper including their clinical implications.",

Entre los fumadores que buscan tratamiento para dejar de fumar hay un porcentaje elevado de ellos con una historia o padecimiento actual de trastornos y síntomas depresivos. Las personas deprimidas experimentan dificultades al dejar de fumar y en el mantenimiento de la abstinencia. En España, la investigación se ha centrado en el estudio de la relación entre fumar y síntomas depresivos. Los fumadores informan niveles más altos de sintomatología depresiva que los que no fuman. Los porcentajes de recaída son más elevados entre los que muestran más síntomas depresivos. Estos síntomas influyen en la eficacia al final del tratamiento y a los 12 meses de seguimiento. También se ha encontrado que una reducción brusca en el consumo de cigarrillos podría causar depresión mayor. Los hallazgos sugieren que los fumadores actuales pueden estar experimentando otros trastornos psiquiátricos distintos a los relacionados con la nicotina.",

This study aims to determine whether adolescents high in trait social anxiety report more cigarette use and greater urge to smoke before, during, and after friend interactions than do teens low in trait social anxiety. Four hundred two students who reported smoking more than once during high school were assessed approximately every 30 min during up to 84-day monitoring sessions. Controlling for momentary anxiety, high socially anxious teens were equally or less likely to smoke, but more likely to report urge to smoke, surrounding friend interactions than low socially anxious teens. Although high socially anxious adolescents do not smoke more than low socially anxious peers, they may believe that they should need a cigarette in anxiety-provoking situations. Such urges may later develop into smoking behaviors.",

The article describes the case of a 31-year-old female patient who, in a suicide attempt, ingested significant amounts of the dietary supplements ‘Blue Magic’ and ‘Purim’. Both supplements contain, among other ingredients: caffeine, yohimbine, reserpine, and synephrine. The patient developed multiple organ failure, which led to her death on the second day of hospitalization. Poisoning by dietary supplements, due to their diverse composition and the lack of correlation between the content and the composition declared by the manufacturer, can pose a significant threat to the health and life of consumers.",

Substance use in our society is common and can have a direct impact on one's physical and mental health. Substance misuse has been identified as a leading cause of chronic medical and mental health conditions. The etiology of substance use is complex. It occurs on a spectrum from abstinence to severe and disordered use. Comprehensive treatment is needed to address the multilayered biopsychosocial issues that hinder recovery from substance use problems. This chapter will discuss lifestyle medicine-based strategies for improving the well-being of individuals who use substances, including motivational interviewing, harm reduction interventions, counseling, diet, and exercise therapies. Motivational interviewing is an effective technique to help an individual move through stages of change toward abstinence. Harm reduction interventions seek to reduce risk associated with substance use and may be useful for individuals as they work toward abstinence. Diet, exercise, group or individual therapies, and other nonpharmacologic modalities can be effective in addressing substance use and its multilayered etiologies.",

Frequently children hospitalized for lead poisoning are treated for their medical illness, only to return with the same history, and it is found that they have continued to ingest substances containing lead. Six cases of lead poisoning admitted to Children's Hospital have been studied from the psychiatric aspects. In all of the cases, a history of pica (an abnormal appetite for substances not fit for food) was present. Children go through a period in their development, beginning at about age 6 months, when it is normal for them to put objects in their mouths. This period ends at about the age of 12 months.

      "abstract": "Hintergrund: Kinder, insbesondere Kleinkinder zwischen dem ersten und vierten Lebensjahr, sind von häuslichen Ingestionsunfällen überdurchschnittlich häufig betroffen. Der Hauptgrund ist das natürliche Erkundungsverhalten in dieser Altersgruppe, bei dem auch fast alles mit dem Mund „untersucht“ wird. Einerseits verleitet die Gestaltung (Farbe, Form, Duft) von chemisch-technischen Erzeugnissen und Gebrauchsgegenständen zum „Kosten“. Andererseits wird das Verhalten der Erwachsenen nachgeahmt. (z.B. beim „Doktorspiel“). Eine für Kinder leicht zugängliche Lagerung der Produkte (z.B. Unterschränke in Küche, Bad und Toilette) begünstigt häufig Ingestionsunfälle. Während im Kleinkindalter Arzneimittel, Wasch-, Reinigungs- und Putzmittel, Kosmetika, Bedarfsgegenstände und Pflanzen als Unfallursache im Vordergrund stehen, wechselt das Spektrum im Schul- und Jugendalter zunehmend zu Vergiftungen mit Arzneimitteln und Drogen. In dieser Altersgruppe kommt es bereits häufiger zu (para-) suizidalen Handlungen oder auch zur missbräuchlichen Verwendung von Produkten (Treibgasinhalation). Exakte Zahlenangaben der jährlichen Vergiftungsfälle im Kindesalter fehlen, weil es keine umfassende Meldepflicht für die behandelnden Ärzte gibt. Sehr unvollständige Meldungen erhält das Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung gemäß §16 e Chemikaliengesetz über Vergiftungen mit Chemikalien und chemischen Produkten, Kosmetika, Pflanzenschutz-, Schädlingsbekämpfung- und Holzschutzmitteln sowie Umweltchemikalien. Schätzungen der deutschen Giftinformationszentren gehen von jährlich insgesamt 100.000 Fällen im Kindesalter aus, davon 10.000 Vergiftungen (10%), darunter 500 vital bedrohliche Fälle (5%) und 20 bis 40 Todesfälle (0,2–0,4%).",

      "abstract": "Craving, which ranges from a sustained desire for drugs persisting for weeks to an acute desire passing within minutes, has been described as an important clinical precipitant of relapse in cocaine and opioid abusers and may be a useful surrogate outcome for developing new drug abuse pharmacotherapies. Whereas craving for opioids frequently has been conceptualized as the negative reinforcer of protracted withdrawal or “drug hunger,” craving for cocaine has been conceptualized as the positive reinforcer of remembered euphoria. Medications can reduce both sustained cocaine craving and acute craving induced by a single dose of cocaine, and reductions in both types of craving are correlated with reductions in cocaine use. Furthermore, high levels of craving during treatment or during cue‐induced challenges predict poor treatment response and later relapse to cocaine abuse in those who have attained abstinence.",

      "abstract": "Information on the adverse effects of cannabis has accrued over the past few decades in a piecemeal fashion. Unfortunately, systematic, well-conducted research on the toxicology of the drug in humans is comparatively rare. In most cases, animal studies are of dubious relevance to human toxicology, and this review concentrates almost exclusively on investigations involving humans. Most information has come from small scale investigations, case reports and anecdotal evidence. Many studies assume that the adverse effects of smoking cannabis and the adverse effects of oral or intravenous delta-9tetrahydrocannabinol or THC (the main psychoactive constituent) are equivalent. This is not necessarily correct since, as discussed in other chapters, there are many other cannabinoids present in the plant. In addition, certain adverse effects of cannabis may depend upon the route of administration. Smoking gives rise to very rapid, and high, plasma and CNS levels of THC. This, for example, produces a different quality of psychoactive effect to that produced by oral administration which has a slow onset, but provides more sustained plasma levels of THC. Smoked cannabis produces adverse effects upon the lungs which do not occur when THC is given orally.",

Inhalant use is highest among adolescents and declines with age. Nitrous oxide is the most commonly used substance, followed by amyl nitrite and organic compounds. There are clues on the history and exam that should raise the suspicion of inhalant use. Metabolites of some organic compounds can be detected on urine testing. Volatile organic compounds are found in a wide variety of household and industrial products. They are associated with a number of medical complications, the most serious of which is encephalopathy. Nitrous oxide and other volatile anesthetic agents are commonly used. The most serious complication associated with their use is hypoxia. Amyl nitrite and related compounds are potent vasodilators. The most serious complications associated with their use are hypotension and methemoglobinemia. There are few data on treatment of individuals who use inhalants.",

      "title": "Drugs In The Life Of Young People",
      "abstract": "The world in which we live sets us in a reality fuelled by the existence of a large variety of psychogenic substances. The temptation of drugs has been verified since ancient times in the human society. The classical definition of drugs is established by the World Health Organization as substances which, once absorbed by a living organism, can alter one or more of its functions. Currently, \"drug\" can be understood as any substance that leads to psychoactive effects that favour the repetition of consumption due to the installation of the state of pleasure, which is considered to be motivated by the consumer. The consequences of non-management of psychoactive substances lead to the establishment of a degrading physical, psychological condition, namely addiction. Drug consumption among adolescents has several particular aspects due to the lack of fully defined personality traits, which can lead to increased vulnerability of children and adolescents due to the negative socio-familial climate. The present work presents the theme of psychoactive substances and its effects drug use among young people aged between 16 and 22 years. The motives that lead young people to drug use, the environment in which they perceive that drug use is frequent, and the way young people are aware of the effects of drug use on people who consume it have been followed. The methodology used to achieve the purpose of this paper is the questionnaire applied to a total of 30 young people, and the answers received are the result of this investigation.",

Este articulo presenta la informacion proporcionada por las cohortes de dos grupos de pacientes adictos a la cocaina y a la metanfetamina. Ambos grupos comenzaron a la vez un tratamiento en el mismo centro y durante el mismo periodo de tiempo de cuatro anos. Los modelos de consumo difieren de forma significativa; los consumidores de cocaina siguen un modelo con mas episodios de consumo de droga, gastan mas dinero en la compra de cocaina y consumen alcohol en mayor grado. Por otro lado, el modelo de consumidores de metanfetamina incluye una proporcion mayor de mujeres, normalmente consumen la droga a diario, consumen marihuana con mas frecuencia y experimentan consecuencias medicas y psiquiatricas mas severas. A pesar de las diferencias en los efectos estimulantes de las dos drogas y en las consecuencias que estas puedan tener en los adictos, las respuestas al tratamiento con un amplio programa ambulatorio, son muy similares.",

Social tolerance to alcohol use is quite high and so far alcohol has not been taken seriously either by the Government or by any social organization. Production, sale, and consumption of alcohol is ever on the increase and it could be taken as the number one problem drug in the country. Cannabis and opium use has been in Nepal for centuries and in the past they did not pose much of a problem. Drug use began to be seen as a problem since only the mid‐1960s and early‐1970s with the influx of large numbers of hippies. Presently, the drug scene in Nepal is dominated by heroin and it has affected youths, mainly in the urban areas. A number of measures, both on supply reduction and demand reduction, have been taken by the Government together with non‐Governmental organizations. However, the number of drug users is on the increase. Relapse rate following detoxification treatment is quite high. After‐care and rehabilitative measures are lacking. Many drug users become involved in high‐risk behaviours in spite of their knowledge of the dangers. Therefore, it calls for the change in our strategies which must be based on the thorough understanding of human nature and its behaviour.",

Second-hand smoke is the mixture of direct smoke from burning a cigarette along with the smoke breathed out from the smoker’s lungs.

This, in turn, makes it harder\nto see our own culture in comparative perspective. The case of what we\ncall ‘drugs’ is an outstanding example. The term is used for a category of\nsubstances taken into the human body for purposes other than nutrition:\n‘drug’, in this sense, is opposed to ‘food’. Its contemporary usage encompasses two broad areas of meaning: medicinal preparations and chemically\nsimilar compounds consumed primarily for hedonistic purposes – where\nchanges in body chemistry are sought for their psychological rather than\nphysiological effects. ‘Drugs’ of both kinds are typically controlled by law,\neither by a system of medical prescription or by legal proscription, with\npenalties for their unauthorized possession; and the use of psychoactive\nmaterials in a non-medical context tends therefore to be characterized as\ndrug ‘abuse’. In this case, they are often described (particularly in American\nusage) as ‘narcotics’ – a term which more properly refers to substances\ncausing sleep or insensibility, but which now usually carries implications\nof illegality.1 The fact that they are often associated with a range of social\nand medical problems, through their use by deprived or disturbed groups\nwithin society, colours the terms in which the substances themselves are\ndescribed.",

Results ：Alcoholics should not practice moderation but abstinence instead for the following reasons. 1) The core concept of the definition of addiction is ‘loss of control.’ 2) Disruption of orbitofronto-striatal functional connectivity underlying perseveration in alcoholics makes them rigid and incapable of controlling drinking. 3) To prevent brain damage caused by repeated excitotoxicity. 4) Long-term follow up studies on alcoholics’ drinking have revealed the inevitable failure of moderation. 5) Due to the reinstatement phenomenon. 6) Moderation is a step towards another relapse. 7) As addicts attach to alcohol, detachment from alcohol makes them form a healthy attachment. 8) For the sake of their loved ones. 9) Abstinence is safer and simpler than moderation. 10) Moderate drinkers do not stand for alcoholics. Conclusion : Moderation is a fit for a few addicts but abstinence is a better fit for the majority of addicts. Although abstinence should be an imperative goal of alcoholics, it should not be forced but instead chosen.",

      "abstract": "The term addiction, derived from a Latin word meaning ‘‘bound to’’ or ‘‘enslaved by,’’ was initially not linked to substance use. However, over the past several hundred years, addiction became associated with excessive alcohol and then drug use, such that by the late 1980s it was largely synonymous with compulsive drug use (O’Brien et al., 2006). The core features of addiction are manifest in the continued performance of the behavior despite adverse consequences, compulsive engagement or diminished control over the behavior, and an appetitive urge or craving state prior to the behavioral engagement representing core elements (Holden, 2010).",

Physicians feel powerless when patients with alcoholic cirrhosis continue drinking or when patients with chronic obstructive airways disease continue smoking despite being on continuous oxygen therapy. Notwithstanding what may seem like a futile exercise, research is beginning to show that medical professionals can make a difference in patients who misuse alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Several studies indicate that brief interventional techniques can identify patients at risk of misusing these substances, markedly reduce tobacco and alcohol consumption, lead to positive changes in health behaviors, and even improve recovery after treatment.1, 2, 3, 4",

      "title": "Small Daily Doses of Insulin: Wasting Money?",
      "abstract": "Newer engineered insulin products are essential tools in diabetes therapy, but there is a potential for degrading glycemic control over time once a vial/pen is opened. Both patient and practitioner need to be aware of proper storage guidelines and the decrease in insulin potency after a seal is punctured.\r\n\r\nBasal insulins such as Lantus and Levemir are supplied in 10 ml multidose vials and 3 ml pen devices. Once the container is punctured, these products have declining potency that may result in reduced blood glucose control if used beyond the Food and Drug Administration-approved use range of 28 days for Lantus and 42 days for Levemir. When using low-dose therapy, considerable volume may remain available for use long after the insulin falls below 95% of its listed potency, setting the stage for unpredictable control and inaccurate clinical adjustment.\r\n\r\nThere have been reports of decreased control when patients exceed open container stability limits; current market factors may increase this risk. Throwing away a container before it is empty is difficult to do for many patients, especially when their budgets are tight. To complicate matters, some prescription plans in the United States have dispensing limits based on prescribed dosage units per vial or pen instead of potency after opening. These plans may not take product stability into account, instead calculating the metric quantity of doses allowed for each prescription. As an example, for a basal insulin dose of 10 units per day, a 10 ml vial would be considered as more than a 90-day supply and a 3 ml pen device 30 days, which exceeds the recommended stability limit on an open container for both sizes of Lantus and the beyond-use date of Levemir's 10 ml vial. Potential for continued use until the vial is nearly empty creates an unknown variable in the evaluation of therapy outcome.\r\n\r\nWhen initiating low-dose basal insulin therapy, stability factors become a concern for all. Frequent or continuous self-monitoring of blood glucose could help determine when products will begin to lose significant potency and help defend a patient supply standard that is product appropriate. However, conducting clinical trials is costly and may not be in a manufacturer's best interest. Also, follow-up on patient compliance on proper home storage and disposal of these products is very difficult for a clinician to do.\r\n\r\nWhile seemingly a small concern on the surface, prescription drug plans with dose/quantity limits and individual financial constraints are affecting home supply, increasing the opportunity for expired use. The Kansas Diabetes Action Council will be posting an updated insulin stability chart on its Web site, http://www.kansasdiabetesactioncouncil.org, to help match insulin products to individual patient circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Vaping is the act of inhaling an aerosol generated by an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), a battery-powered device that heats a reservoir of liquid, typically nicotine-containing, to deliver contents to the user. E-cigarettes were initially introduced as a means of smoking cessation, although evidence of their effectiveness is limited. There is a widespread perception that these products are a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, driven in large part by marketing efforts by e-cigarette manufacturers. Yet to achieve vaporization, temperatures are so high that components of the device hardware, such as metals, plastics, rubber and foam, are aerosolized and inhaled along with the vaporized e-liquid containing nicotine, flavoring and solvents. We do not fully understand the health consequences of such aerosol exposure, particularly long-term effects, but short-term negative cardiovascular and respiratory effects have been demonstrated. Very few studies have evaluated the reproductive effect of e-cigarette use. We do not know whether vaping during pregnancy affects birth outcomes or the lifelong health of the fetus. There has been an exponential rise in the use of e-cigarettes in the United States since their introduction, particularly among youths, while concurrently there has been a laudable reduction in conventional cigarette use. It is imperative that obstetrician–gynecologists have a basic understanding of e-cigarettes, screen all patients as is consistently done for conventional smoking, and provide resources to patients about potential negative consequences of use.",

En la adolescencia se inician conductas que ponen en severo riesgo la salud .Casi dos tercios de las muertes prematuras y un tercio de la morbilidad en adultos se asocian a condiciones o comportamientos que comenzaron en su juventud. La ingesta copiosa de alcohol en forma reiterada puede ocasionar daños irreversibles tanto a nivel cerebral, como en otros órganos. Si a esta conducta, se asocia el consumo de bebidas energizantes, se altera el patrón de uso de bebidas alcohólicas, especialmente destiladas, ya que la mezcla mejora el sabor y potencia el consumo. A lo que se debe sumar los efectos propios de las bebidas energizantes.Objetivos:Investigar el consumo de alcohol asociado a bebidas “energizantes” en la llamada “previa”, y la permisibilidad de los padresMaterial y método: Se investigó el consumo de alcohol asociado a bebidas energizantes, en 370 personas de diferentes niveles educativos , entre 18 a 35 años, que en forma voluntaria y anónima completaron una encuesta estructurada y cerrada,en formato Google Drive la cual indagaba sobre “la previa”.Resultados:El 89% de los encuestados que respondieron la encuesta, estaban entre los 18 y 24 años; 65,4 % del sexo femenino. El 71 % manifestaron ser estudiantes universitarios, de los cuales 51% vive con su familia nuclear, del total de los encuestados 91 % consume bebidas alcohólicas, el 70% ingiere más de 2-3 medidas de alcohol y el 41 % bebió en la última semana (alcohol o mezcla). El 40% bebe alcohol con bebidas energizantes, 68% comienza a beber en su domicilio con el consentimiento de sus padres ,de éstos, 36% relata haber presentado síntomas compatibles con intoxicación, el 25% de éstas intoxicaciones ocurrieron en el domicilio en el cual viven con sus padres.Conclusión:El consumo de alcohol en jóvenes en “La previa” es problemático,tornándose más severo al asociarlo a bebidas energizantes. Cifras que coinciden con otros estudios de nuestro medio. Llama la atención la tolerancia social de los adultos. Sin duda, deben realizarse más estudios al respecto.",

      "abstract": "A major problem facing physicians involved in the daily care of amateur athletes in international competition is that of so-called doping. While there are many substances used that might be considered ineffectual or physiologic, the two main categories of substances considered as doping agents are stimulants and anabolic steroids. No substance is as yet known that will improve an athlete's performance. Often such substances are taken in error rather than in a misguided attempt to improve one's ability. These substances can be dangerous and, because of this, doping rules were established basically to protect the athlete. Anabolic steroids are particularly dangerous; they usually are taken by those engaged in lifting or throwing sports in an attempt to improve performance by increasing muscle bulk. There is as yet no scientific proof that performance is improved. Dope testing for stimulants should be carried out in a quantitative rather than qualitative manner so that the athlete who has taken a small amount of a so-called stimulant (such as an asthma or common cold preparation) would not be excluded from competition. Rigid testing for anabolic steroids should be continued.",

      "abstract": "Whenever we discuss regarding the alcoholism, which may be chronic or acute, it seems that the people who consumes alcohol may be due to any causes, it leads to a Alcoholic addiction. In the primary stage of alcoholic consumption, it may not harm to body but some socio-economic problem may occur. Sometimes the family members as well as friends also ignore to such activities of user knowingly or unknowingly. Users often take beetle with tobacco products in order to conceal the fact, which may also harm to their body. As the time passes and if it is not controlled by him-self or family, then such person falls down to an another world, from where he does not want to come back and he makes distances from family as well as good friends. At last a stage comes where he becomes ruined socially, economically, physically and mentally. Some users even try to commit suicide due to frustration. Homicidal activities and sexual violence may also be noticed. Now-a-days alcoholism is a commonest cause for incidents of murder and rape as well as traffic accidents. Hence if the consumer adopt the lifestyle described in Ayurveda and Yoga, then one can give up the addiction of alcohol and able to lead a happy and healthy life.",

Such placebo-like effects are typically attributed to conditioning, motivation, or expectations about product efficacy. The present research shows such effects can also occur because, under some conditions, people are more prone to underestimate the time to onset of products they have used in the past. These recollections of too short a time to onset alter people’s experience of products and cause them to report more rapid effects. Participants who were led to believe there was a strong causal link between having consumed a product and improved performance on a task recalled that less time elapsed before they experienced an effect. In subsequent consumption, they felt comfortable using the product later in time, started working on a similar task earlier upon use, experienced the product’s effect sooner, and were less inclined to switch to competing products.",

Their intestinal transit time has been shown to be normal. Nevertheless about fifty percent of the elderly use laxatives. In the very old and in institutions the use is even more frequent. The main cause of this real or supposed constipation is the lack of dietary fibre in the food. In the aged constipation can have dangerous complications, e.g. acute mental confusion, urinary retention, urinary incontinence and fecal impaction. Treatment may include general measurements, the addition of bulk-laxatives to the diet and the prescription of other laxatives. The use of laxatives other than bulk-laxatives may cause many harmful side-effects in the aged. The daily food must contain sufficient dietary fibre. Failing this one can use bran, preparations of psyllium or lactulose syrup.",

Due to its structural similarities with psychostimulants, bupropion is suggested to have addictive potential. Several case reports have been published addressing its misuse in recent years, mainly through nasal insufflation and intravenous administration. Most of the reported cases cited a history of substance use disorder. Methods Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to write this case report. Case presentation We present a case with alcohol use disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, who developed a substance use disorder to bupropion while chewing it in doses up to 2250 mg, in an attempt to get “high” with no history of seizures. Discussion Our case suggests that bupropion can also be misused by chewing even at high doses and that it can lead to a substance use disorder. Its use in various indications in treating mental disorders and its over-the-counter accessibility, along with a lower risk of stigmatization, could increase the prevalence of bupropion misuse. It is essential to know the medical consequences of bupropion misuse as there is increasing data on its addictive potential. More information is needed to clarify the impact of the route of administration on drug metabolism and adverse effects.",

      "title": "Gangs, Drug Use, and Drug Selling in the United States",
      "abstract": "Gangs and drugs are two major criminological issues that come together in the United States. On the one hand, gang members use more drugs than non-gang youth, so much so that gang membership itself is an indicator that an individual will have a significant drug use profile. Compared with non-gang youth, gang members also begin to use drugs at earlier ages, use a greater variety of drugs, use them with greater frequency, and participate in other risk behaviors (e.g., violence, unsafe sexual behaviors) while intoxicated. Alcohol and marijuana feature prominently within the drug use repertoires of gang members, and the latter is considered normalized within gang cultures. Gang members also use other “hard” drugs, such as crystal methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and heroin, despite the fact that the use of such drugs is stigmatized among them. Gang membership is also characterized by polysubstance use—the simultaneous or sequential use of a variety of drugs, as well as nonmedical prescription drug misuse. As a result, gang members are at great risk of many negative social and health consequences related to drug use. On the other hand, gang members sell drugs. A wealth of academic data contradicts the legal and public perceptions about this relationship. First, a commonly held view is that gangs control a majority of the sales of illegal drugs within any one area. However, this clashes with research specifically on gangs, which reveals that few members within any one gang sell drugs and that few gangs are specifically focused on selling drugs. Another area where academic research conflicts with widely held perceptions is the idea that drug selling is a lucrative endeavor for gang members. While the public and law enforcement agencies may believe gang members are making significant amounts of money selling drugs, research indicates that the majority of gang members who do sell drugs do not appear to earn significantly more money than they could earn working the same number of hours at a job paying minimum wage. Such findings further argue that such amounts hardly seem worth the risk given the large numbers of gang members killed or imprisoned in relation to selling drugs.",

      "title": "Should I Stop Smoking",
      "abstract": "1. The Problem A few weeks ago I firmly decided to stop smoking. There are many good prudential reasons for this decision: the health risks, the economic cost, the regular morning-cough, the smell in my home, the troubles I have to go through in order to satisfy my addiction in an increasingly non-smoking society, the uneasy experience of being controlled by the habit and the accompanying loss of dignity. And then there are the health risks, of course. Slow death in lung cancer is hardly appealing and neither are the other various troubles that without doubt will hit me within the next twenty years. Add to these all the benevolent reasons which could be mobilised in support of the same thesis (dangers for people in my surroundings, the smell of my clothes and my body and other inconveniences to them caused by my disgusting habit), and the case for my obligation to stop smoking seems overwhelming, no matter what set of basic ethical norms and values is applied. There is one problem, however ? a problem I share with many other smokers: I have a weak character. I could, if I flexed the muscles of my will-power to their extreme, probably endure the problems of abstinence. However, in past attempts to 'kick the habit' I have never in fact done so and this is due to my strong tendency to yield to the temptation of the moment. But, since I in fact have such a lousy character, may I not as well yield immediately? Would the few weeks of pointless struggle really amount to anything more than sheer masochism: agony leading up to nothing? Might I not just as well have another cigarette immediately, thereby avoiding a non-negliable amount of pointless suffering? Intuitively, the correct answer to these questions seems to be affirmative. I should, therefore, have another cigarette. But since the same reasoning applies to any single cigarette I may smoke in the future, and since to stop smoking involves abstaining from each such cigarette, this line of reasoning seems to lead back to the negation of the thesis above: I should not stop smoking! This, then, is the problem I want to address: Can the just outlined paradox be resolved, and, if so, should I really try to stop smoking in light of the facts about my weak character? It is a real problem, I should know, because the story I have told is about myself and it is true. But how should we reflect on it? I will approach it from two different viewpoints: first, from the perspective of normative ethics and, secondly, from the perspective of decision theory. My conclusion will be somewhat perplexing: on the one hand, although partly faulty, the reasoning sketched above is mostly correct, but, on the other, people like me (people with a weak character, that is) should in general avoid to think along such (albeit correct) lines.",

Research shows extensive consequences from chronic use of processed foods. Although the pathology is distressing, educating clients about the link between compulsive chronic consumption of processed foods and relief from so many conditions can create a positive attitude toward recovery. Probing for the extensive consequences of food addiction motivates clients to start recovery and stay with it. Gently guiding clients through the process of uncovering the extent of consequences may be distressing, but as the myriad of conditions moves into remission clients can be reinforced in their determination to stick to a program of recovery.",

The stereotypical image of a down-and-out heroin addict desperate for a fix can obscure the less familiar figure of the 40-something mum who secretly pops painkillers, watching the clock until it’s time for her next dose.\r\n\r\n‘Respectable addiction’ is not an emerging societal problem, as some might believe; it has been prevalent for many years. International research spanning well over a decade has suggested that a surprisingly high number of people are knowingly or otherwise abusing over the counter (OTC) medications, and there is widespread awareness of this problem among both the general public and the professionals – doctors and pharmacists – alike.\r\n\r\nNon-prescription analgesics containing codeine – a short-acting opium-based drug that belongs to the same family as heroin and morphine – are the most commonly identified OTC medicines being abused in Ireland, but problems have also been linked to products containing dextromethorphan (cough suppressant), pseudoephedrine (decongestant) and laxatives.\r\n\r\nAlthough the true extent of OTC misuse/abuse and addiction in Ireland is unclear, all indications are that it is relatively widespread and increasing. In a 2007 survey of over 100 pharmacists in Ireland, the vast majority (94%) believed that some customers, estimated at an average of four per day, who purchased products containing codeine, were addicted to codeine.\r\n\r\nAccording to the National Drug Treatment Reporting System, maintained by the Health Research Board, the numbers entering treatment for codeine as a problem drug have increased considerably in recent years, from 40 in 1998 to 180 in 2009.

      "abstract": "SummaryIn a study of 249 opiate (mainly heroin) addicts special attention was paid to adjunctive drug use. Generally, nicotine (cigarette smoking), alcohol and cannabis preceded the use of heroin, and continued to be used as adjunctive drugs after the establishment of heroin addiction. Nicotine was the most common substance used together with opiates. Alcohol and cannabis were used as adjunctive drugs in about two-thirds of the cases. In the late stages of heroin addiction, benzo-diazepines were also used concomitantly with opiates. The most frequently reported reason for the use of adjunctive drugs was to intensify the effect of the opiate. Three-quarters or more of the addicts had used different adjunctive drugs to boost the euphoric feeling derived from the primary drug, i.e. heroin. Attempt at self-treatment of withdrawal symptoms was a less frequently reported reason for adjunctive drug use. The findings show that heroin addiction is the major problem. The use of adjunctive drugs, especially benzodiazepines, can be partly explained on economic grounds. They must be clearly distinguished from the primary drug of abuse, heroin. For policy-making decisions, it is important that the elimination of heroin abuse through effective prevention measures would ultimately wipe out the problem of adjunctive drug use, while reduction of the overall supply of heroin without reduction in actual demand might result in an increasing trend to adjunctive drug use.Key Words:: Drug dependenceheroin addictionnarcoticscannabisalcoholbenzodiazepinesMalaysia",

      "title": "The health effects of cannabis: Key issues of policy relevance",
      "abstract": "Cannabis remains one of the most widely abused drugs worldwide, with a substantial number of users in many Western societies. Epidemiological studies reveal that most users are young individuals either in their teens or early twenties. The most prevalent pattern of use is intermittent. Traditional use of cannabis is also prevalent in many countries. The main acute adverse effects of cannabis are cognitive impairment, especially of attention and memory, psychomotor impairment, and a possible increased risk of traffic accidents. The main physical and psychological health effects of chronic, heavy cannabis use, especially daily use, over many years, are most commonly respiratory disease, dependence and subtle cognitive impairment. It is estimated that approximately 10 per cent of persons who try cannabis progress to daily use, with a further 20 to 30 per cent using it on a weekly basis. Cannabis use during pregnancy is likely to result in shortened gestation and low-birth-weight babies. Other potential dangers of chronic heavy use that remain to be confirmed include an increased risk of developing cancer, a decline in occupational performance, impaired educational attainment in adolescents and birth defects. While it is known that underachieving adolescents are more likely to smoke cannabis, a cause-effect relationship has not been established. There is considerable anecdotal information regarding the therapeutic usefulness of smoking cannabis. In recent times, the most intense interest has been directed towards the prevention of weight loss in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), although management of pain, prevention of emesis and control of glaucoma and movement disorders still command attention. Of these potential uses, treatment of cachexia in AIDS patients and of chronic pain seems most worthy of scientific validation. Efforts to develop synthetic cannabinoid derivatives should remain a primary goal for treatment of most such disorders. The discovery of an endogenous cannabinoid system provides a means not only of developing new therapeutic agents but also of establishing the biological consequences of long-term cannabis exposure on the brain. The localization of cannabinoid receptors in brain areas associated with some of the most prominent pharmacological effects of cannabis, that is, cognition, pain perception and movement, provides an insight into the physiological importance of those receptors. The identification of anandamide, the endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptor, provided credence for a naturally occurring endogenous cannabinoid system in the brain. This endogenous system adapts to chronic exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by a reduction in the number of receptors, the physiological consequence of which remains to be established.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is one of the pandemic chronic diseases commonly associated with health disorders such as heart attack, high blood pressure, diabetes or even cancer. Among the current natural products for obesity and weight control, Garcinia or more specifically hydroxycitric acid (HCA) extracted from Garcinia has been widely used. The evaluation of the potential toxicity of weight control supplement is of the utmost importance as it requires long term continuous consumption in order to maintain its effects. Majority of reports demonstrated the efficacy of Garcinia/HCA without any toxicity found. However, a few clinical toxicity reports on weight-loss diet supplements of which some were combinations that included Garcinia/HCA as an active ingredient showed potential toxicity towards spermatogenesis. Nonetheless, it cannot be concluded that Garcinia/HCA is unsafe. Those products which have been reported to possess adverse effects are either polyherbal or multi-component in nature. To date, there is no case study or report showing the direct adverse effect of HCA. The structure, mechanism of action, long history of the use of Garcinia/HCA and comprehensive scientific evidence had shown \"no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL)\" at levels up to 2800 mg/day, suggesting its safety for use.",

      "abstract": "Older people consult their doctors less than younger people in relation to both their reported morbidity and their prescribed medication. Some of the large iceberg of symptoms among the elderly might respond to a modification of their current drug regimens. Assessments of medicine taking patterns among the elderly revealed various inadequacies in supervision and a substantial proportion of questionable prescribing. General practitioners were often unaware that elderly patients lived alone, or that they drank alcohol or drove—even when they were taking prescribed medicines for which drinking or driving were contraindicated. Just over a third of elderly people were taking prescribed medicines of which their general practitioners were apparently unaware. The way doctors prescribe for their elderly patients and supervise this prescribing is suggested as a suitable field for audit. The completeness of their records in relation to prescriptions, drinking, driving, and living alone is another possible area for study. So too is the home visiting of the very elderly, particularly those living alone.",

Patients who usually smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day also drank more alcohol and more tea or coffee than others. Heavy smoking and the frequent drinking of tea or coffee were associated with later times of going to bed at night but not with insomnia. Alcohol consumption was unrelated to any aspect of sleep habits. These findings are consistent with the view that heavy smokers tend to be more extroverted than non-smokers and seek arousal both by out-going social activities and by the use of stimulant drugs such as nicotine and caffeine. However, heavy smokers do not necessarily suffer from long-term emotional distress which would cause insomnia.",

This is primarily done as a recreational activity. But, owing to the chemicals present in tobacco, it slowly becomes addictive in nature. Few smokers use effective smoking cessation aids when trying to stop smoking. Smoking is the most important single cause of morbidity and mortality in under developed, developing and developed countries. Because smoking prevention will not affect tobacco-related mortality, quitting by current smokers is the main way to achieve positive effects on mortality. Many smokers are interested in quitting. Most of the smokers try to quit smoking at least once in their lifetime. To support smokers in their quit attempts, a wide range of smoking cessation aids is available. These comprise methods and products to assist smokers in quitting through coping with psychological or physical aspects of nicotine dependence. Meta-analyses have shown that smoking cessation courses, nicotine replacement therapy, and bupropion can significantly increase success rates in quitting. Even minimal interventions such as self-help materials have a small effect when compared with no intervention.",

      "title": "Enhancement drugs: are there limits to what we should enhance and why?",
      "abstract": "Substances, such as alcohol, opiates and cannabis, have been used by humans for millennia. Today, a much wider range of substances are used for a range of purposes, including the enhancement of performance during university studies, sexual experiences, sports, exercise, at celebrations, socializing and the experience of art and music. Substance use is also associated with a range of harmful effects to the individual and society as a whole. Prohibitions, regulation, prevention and treatment have all been used to protect against this harm. In this commentary, it is argued that public health interventions should target relevant harms and not to evaluate which aspects of human endeavors and experiences should be enhanced and which should not. It is argued that interventions should directly target the harmful effects, using the best available evidence. Two examples are given of substances that may be altered to prevent serious harm - one for alcohol and one for cannabis. In the case of alcohol, the addition of dissolved oxygen could reduce both the risk of accidents and the risk of liver damage associated with alcohol consumption. In the case of cannabis, there is strong indication that the reduction of content Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol and the increase of cannabidiol could reduce the risk of psychoses and the addiction associated with its use. The aim of this article is to show that responsible regulation should not necessarily be restricted to preventing the use and/or (in the case of alcohol) a reduction in the amounts and frequency of its use, but should also aim to include a range of other strategies that could reduce the burden of illness associated with illicit substance use.",

In laboratory experiments, mice pre-exposed with nicotine via cigarette or vape demonstrated addictive behaviors around THC; however, mice pre-exposed with normal air did not demonstrate these addictive behaviors [2]. Nicotine use can also increase the rewarding feeling derived from using other mind-altering drugs; therefore, vaping itself may be a dangerous gateway that increases the propensity for other types of substance use and addiction [3].",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Cannabis sativa (marijuana) is used throughout the world, and its use is increasing. In much of the world, marijuana is illicit. While inhalation of smoke generated by igniting dried components of the plant is the most common way marijuana is used, there is concern over potential adverse lung effects. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent studies that explore the impact upon the respiratory system of inhaling marijuana smoke. Recent findings Smoking marijuana is associated with chronic bronchitis symptoms and large airway inflammation. Occasional use of marijuana with low cumulative use is not a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The heavy use of marijuana alone may lead to airflow obstruction. The immuno-histopathologic and epidemiologic evidence in marijuana users suggests biological plausibility of marijuana smoking as a risk for the development of lung cancer; at present, it has been difficult to conclusively link marijuana smoking and cancer development. Summary There is unequivocal evidence that habitual or regular marijuana smoking is not harmless. A caution against regular heavy marijuana usage is prudent. The medicinal use of marijuana is likely not harmful to lungs in low cumulative doses, but the dose limit needs to be defined. Recreational use is not the same as medicinal use and should be discouraged.",

      "abstract": "Figure: viscous lidocaine, medication, gastrointestinalFigureOne of my pharmacology professors in medical school often quipped, “Physicians would think twice about giving certain dubious medications if they sampled them themselves.” There is no better example of this than viscous lidocaine. It might be one of the most foul-tasting medications ever invented. Ask the nurses. Many have sampled of this sour sludge that tastes like expired lemonade with the consistency of runny syrup. Patients agree that it tastes awful. Indeed, patient satisfaction after receiving a GI cocktail is lower when lidocaine is given. (Acad Emerg Med. 2020;27[9]:905; https://bit.ly/3nq0teM.) It's not just the taste. Lidocaine does not add to the success of the GI cocktail, and you should not be giving it routinely. Dyspepsia is a common symptom encountered in the ED. Classically, it's a mix of epigastric pain, nausea, and bloating. Dyspeptic symptoms are also frequently described as abdominal discomfort relieved by food or antacids, worse at night or during recumbency, or associated with a previous diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal reflux. Emergency physicians routinely give GI cocktails to patients to relieve symptoms. What's fascinating is the variety of contents in these cocktails. Many clinicians have their own preferred mixes to give to patients. Some contain antihistamines; others contain simethicone. Liquid combinations of antacids containing calcium carbonate and magnesium-hydroxide (Mylanta) or aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone (Maalox) are commonly given. The Donnatal elixir contains phenobarbital, hyoscyamine, atropine, and scopolamine. (UpToDate. Nov. 29, 2001; https://bit.ly/3GAfaEC.) It sounds like an M&M case waiting to happen. Nail in the Coffin Viscous lidocaine has been the most studied alongside Mylanta and Maalox. One of the reasons it became popular was an initial randomized controlled trial from 1990 with 34 adult patients that used a visual analog pain scale to compare pain responses after giving 30 mL of antacid (Mylanta) with or without 15 mL viscous lidocaine. They found that lidocaine decreased pain scores compared with antacid alone, but the study did not address any limitations. (UpToDate. Nov. 29, 2001; https://bit.ly/3GAfaEC.) Those positive results have not been replicated since this initial study, however. Two more randomized controlled trials have been performed (one with 82 patients, another with 113), and neither found that adding viscous lidocaine favorably reduced pain scores v. antacid alone. (J Emerg Med. 2004;27[1]:7; J Emerg Med. 2003;25[3]:239.) The nail in the coffin came in 2020 when another randomized controlled trial found no difference in pain scores. Patients also did not like the taste of lidocaine even 60 minutes post-administration. (Acad Emerg Med. 2020;27[9]:905; https://bit.ly/3nq0teM.) The literature, albeit modest evidence from small studies, demonstrates that lidocaine does not reduce patients' symptoms. And most patients (and staff) believe it tastes awful.

      "abstract": "Substance misuse is inextricably linked into the homelessness story of many of the individuals who find themselves homeless in the UK. Many patients will not be seeking treatment for their substance misuse but can be reassured that treatment will be forthcoming should their attitude change in the future. Alcohol is an important factor in the addiction picture for many homeless patients. It is a fact of life in the homeless environment, with many homeless people having primary alcohol problems. Even if the patient is not using alcohol at the time of assessment, it is extremely common, if not the norm, for alcohol use to creep in as substitute prescribing is instituted and street drug usage decreases. Homeless people live in a dangerous and threatening environment. Substance misusers who are homeless are prone to chronic illnesses such as epilepsy, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic hepatitis C.",

      "abstract": "A RELUCTANCE TO CONTACT. Haphephobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by an intense fear of being touched without consent. Among the symptoms of this condition are immediate anxiety after being touched or when contemplating being touched, avoidance of situations where the person may be touched, and panic attacks. The most common strategy for dealing with this aversion to being touched entails a variety of types of behavioral therapy, as well as coping mechanisms, such as relaxation techniques. PASSING THROUGH. Excessive flatulence is generally an indication that a person either has a digestive system disorder or is experiencing a sensitivity to a particular food. As a rule, flatulence occurs for a number of reasons. One possibility involves the fact that individuals tend to swallow a bit of air as they eat or drink. Then as the air makes its way to the intestines, it is released as a burp or leaves the body as gas. Gas also is a by-product of natural activity in the digestive system. The bacteria that live in the gut create different gases as they break down food, which are subsequently expelled as flatulence. HAIR TODAY, GONE TOMORROW. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that typically results in an unpredictable hair loss. This condition leads to the loss of hair in patches, approximately the size of a quarter. The attendant loss can range from a few patches to a more extreme level of total baldness. Although no cure currently exists for the disorder, some forms of treatment can help individuals regrow their hair more quickly, such as corticosteroids—anti-inflammatory drugs. PUMPING UP. Edema is the buildup of fluids in the ankles, feet, and legs, which leads to swelling. This condition is a common problem, especially among older adults. There are a number of factors that can cause edema, including problems with the body’s lymphatic system, long-term protein deficiency, weakness in the veins, kidney complications, cirrhosis of the liver, and congestive heart failure. Among the treatment options for this condition are wearing compression socks, elevating the legs whenever possible, losing weight, soaking the feet and ankles in Epsom salts, and taking magnesium supplements. ONLY THE NOSE KNOWS. Nonallergic rhinitis entails chronic sneezing or a congested, drippy nose with no apparent cause. The exact triggers that cause the blood vessels in the nose to expand, filling the nasal lining with blood and fluid, are unknown. However, there are several possible catalysts, including environmental irritants; reaction to particular medications, infections, food, and beverages; and sleep-related issues. Avoiding the potential irritants, using antihistamine or steroid nasal sprays, and taking antihistamine tablets are among the common treatments for the condition. EARSPLITTING. Hyperacusis is a condition that occurs when a person’s hearing becomes oversensitive to certain sounds, making them seem louder than they really are. The disorder, which is caused by changes in how the brain processes sound, is usually centered on certain sound frequencies. Among the factors that can lead to these changes are damage to the cochlea (from exposure to loud noise), a head injury, Lyme disease, Bell’s palsy, PTSD, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common treatment for the condition is to wear a special hearing aid. TO PEE OR NOT TO PEE? Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control, a relatively common and often embarrassing problem. The severity of the condition ranges from a person leaking urine when they cough or sneeze to experiencing an urge to urinate, which is so strong that the individual does not get to the toilet in time. Urinary incontinence is not a disease but rather a symptom of a wide range of both short-term (e.g., urinary tract infection, constipation, and medicine) and long-term (e.g., diabetes, multiple sclerosis, enlarged prostate for men, and childbirth for women) health issues. Among the treatments that can help a person take control over their bladder are making lifestyle changes, taking medication, and undergoing surgery. IMPULSIVITY PERSONIFIED. Excoriation disorder is a repetitive, compulsive picking and scratching at the skin, to the point where serious tissue damage occurs. The condition is usually chronic, with periods of remission alternating with periods of greater symptom intensity. Although no specific cause has been identified for the disorder, evidence exists suggesting a genetic predisposition to the condition. Both medication and cognitive behavioral therapy have been found to possibly reduce the symptoms of the disorder. THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental illness characterized by a person being persistently preoccupied with at least one perceived flaw in their appearance. Individuals with this condition may frequently examine their appearance in the mirror, constantly compare how they look to others, and regularly try to avoid social situations or having their photo taken. As a rule, treatment includes undergoing counseling and taking antidepressant medicine. SWEETS BE DAMNED. A sugar intolerance is a condition in which an individual has difficulty in either digesting or processing sugar. This nutritional state, which is relatively common, causes a range of digestive issues that tend to vary from person to person. The basic way to treat sugar intolerance is to identify the triggers that are causing the condition and to eliminate those foods from the diet.",

Pilots who are required to abstain before and during flight may suffer cockpit performance decrements. This study reviews the physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and psychological effects of smoking withdrawal as they relate to flying performance. The variety of research designs, methodologies, and subject groups is discussed. Findings suggest that heart rate, arousal, vasoconstriction, vigilance, concentration, and energy increase with nicotine use; stress and irritability are reduced with smoking. Withdrawal, on the other hand, produces a decrease in carboxyhemoglobin, digit recall, serial addition/subtraction, and job satisfaction; blood pressure, depression, absenteeism, caloric intake, craving, aggressiveness, confusion, and impulsivity increase with withdrawal. Severity of withdrawal symptoms varied, but most studies report psychological, and/or physiological responses to nicotine withdrawal. The conflict between health and performance is discussed and suggestions for future directions are offered.",

      "abstract": "Experimentation is a large part of the college experi- ence. It could be argued that no campus is completely clean of drug abuse and the three most common drugs used by col- lege students are alcohol, marijuana, and prescription stimu- lants. This article will focus on the two legal, but recklessly abused drugs: the godfather of campus drugs - alcohol, and the new kid on the block - prescription stimulants. Drugs in College THE MIND FALL THE MIND Alcohol Fermentation is said to be the oldest chemistry utilized by man. Alcohol sat proudly in the holy grail during the last supper, intoxicated the Trojans during their celebration of a big wooden horse, and was both the gift and the weapon of choice of the Grecian/Roman god Bacchus. Alcohol, a depressant, has accompanied man throughout the ages, mak- ing him hyper-social, dizzy, numb, indecent, unconscious, and ultimately hung-over. So how does alcohol inflict its power? An alcohol is an organic compound with one or more hydroxyl or alcohol (- OH) groups attached. Ethanol, in particular, is the alcohol that we consume. Although the fine details of the biochem- istry of alcohol are still uncertain, it has long been suspected that the transmission of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a mostly inhibitory neurotransmitter, is somehow effected by alcohol (Paul 2006). In 2006, researchers demonstrated that the actions of GABA are amplified by the presence of alco- hol at the GABAA receptors, a ligand-gated ion channel in charge of GABA transmission (Hanchar 2006 and Wallner 2006). When GABA binds to the GABAA receptors, the pore opens, allowing chloride ions (Cl-) to rush down the electro- chemical gradient. The result is an axon with a charge more negative than one at normal resting membrane potential. Thus, depolarizing the neuron becomes extremely difficult http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/pharmaceuticals/images/rit alin.jpg Microscope view of Ritalin (Siegel 1999). Ultimately, this process impairs fluidity in movement and delays reaction time. While most alcohol consumers drink only until they are tipsy, sometimes they lose control and drink to the point of being blacked out. Later, they may possess no memory of events that had occurred during that time. This black-out period has recently been proven to be connected to the effects of alcohol on the hippocampus, an area of the brain in which short-term memories are stored (White 2000). Non-alcohol related damage to the hippocampi causes similar behavioral effects in comparison to the consequences of drinking alcohol. To illustrate, in one famous procedure, the hippocampi of a patient, HM, were removed in order to relieve his epileptic seizures. The subject continued to score above average on IQ tests despite lacking his hippocampi. Researchers also found that the patient was perfectly capable of carrying on a coherent conversation with another individ- ual. However, upon returning to the room after just a few minutes of absence, dialogue with the subject would reveal that he could neither recall who the speaker was, nor what the conversation had been about. This phenomenon closely resembles that of an alcohol induced black-out, further sug- gesting that alcohol may affect the hippocampus. So far, the alcohol side-effects of drowsy, uncoordinated movements and memory loss have been explained, but what about the symptom with which alcohol is most associated - poor judgment? Researchers have hypothesized that the frontal lobe, which controls information processing, impulse suppression, and social awareness, might be the target region that causes the lack of judgment after alcohol consumption. Sure enough, it has been shown that the short-term effects of intoxication include a decrease in metabolism and activity in the frontal lobe (Wang et al. 2000). Similarly, chronic alco- hol abuse can damage and even shrink the frontal lobe, but there is much less information on alcohol's acute effects on this region of the brain (Kril and Halliday 1999). The frontal lobe has also been chosen as an area of alco- hol research because of the similarity in behavior between intoxicated individuals and those with frontal lobe damage. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a disease that can illustrate the effects of an impaired frontal lobe, which may illuminate the impact of alcohol on this region of the brain. In patients with FTLD, the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain experience tissue atrophy and shrinkage. Patients tend to lose such characteristics as: good judgment, manners, or common sense During an interview with an FTLD sufferer (to be referred to as the interviewee), the interviewee seemed normal at first, though perhaps a little too relaxed and happy to be at an by Joy Yang",

      "title": "Development of Dependence in Smokers and Rodents With Voluntary Nicotine Intake: Similarities and Differences",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Smoking and vaping throughout adolescence and early adulthood lead to nicotine dependence. Nicotine withdrawal is associated with somatic and affective withdrawal symptoms that contribute to smoking and relapse. Affective nicotine withdrawal symptoms in humans include craving for cigarettes, depression, anxiety, trouble sleeping, and cognitive deficits. Methods Herein, we review clinical studies that investigated nicotine dependence in people who smoke or vape. We also discuss studies that investigated the development of dependence in animals with oral nicotine intake, nicotine aerosol self-administration, and intravenous nicotine self-administration. Results Clinical studies report that adolescents who smoke daily develop nicotine dependence before those who smoke infrequently, but ultimately all smokers become dependent in adulthood. Preclinical studies indicate that rats that self-administer nicotine also become dependent. Rats that self-administer nicotine display somatic withdrawal signs and affective withdrawal signs, including increased anxiety and depressive-like behavior, cognitive deficits, and allodynia. Most nicotine withdrawal signs were observed in rodents with daily (7 days/week) or intermittent long access (23-hour) to nicotine. Clinical smoking studies report symptoms of nicotine dependence in adolescents of both sexes, but virtually all preclinical nicotine self-administration studies have been done with adult male rats. Conclusions The role of sex and age in the development of dependence in nicotine self-administration studies remains under-investigated. However, the role of sex and age in nicotine withdrawal has been thoroughly evaluated in studies in which nicotine was administered noncontingently. We discuss the need for volitional nicotine self-administration studies that explore the gradual development of dependence during adolescence and adulthood in rodents of both sexes. Implications The reviewed clinical studies investigated the development of nicotine dependence in male and female adolescent and young adult smokers and vapers. These studies indicate that most adolescent smokers and vapers gradually become nicotine dependent. Preclinical studies with rodents show that nicotine intake in widely used self-administration models also leads to dependence. However, almost all animal studies that investigated the development of nicotine dependence have been conducted with adult male rats. To better model smoking and vaping, it is important that nicotine intake in rats or mice starts during adolescence and that both sexes are included.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Drug abuse occurs in all sports and at most levels of competition. Athletic life may lead to drug abuse for a number of reasons, including for performance enhancement, to self-treat otherwise untreated mental illness, and to deal with stressors, such as pressure to perform, injuries, physical pain, and retirement from sport. This review examines the history of doping in athletes, the effects of different classes of substances used for doping, side effects of doping, the role of anti-doping organizations, and treatment of affected athletes. Doping goes back to ancient times, prior to the development of organized sports. Performance-enhancing drugs have continued to evolve, with “advances” in doping strategies driven by improved drug testing detection methods and advances in scientific research that can lead to the discovery and use of substances that may later be banned. Many sports organizations have come to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs and have very strict consequences for people caught using them. There is variable evidence for the performance-enhancing effects and side effects of the various substances that are used for doping. Drug abuse in athletes should be addressed with preventive measures, education, motivational interviewing, and, when indicated, pharmacologic interventions.

That would be a good thing, although the research that is starting to accumulate about this therapeutic use of e-cigarettes is so far not promising.2\n\nSecondly, e-cigarettes could be used to maintain a tobacco habit by allowing smokers nicotine intake in tobacco free areas, such as the workplace or home, because the vapor emitted from e-cigarettes is odorless and presumed to be not toxic.

La interrelacion entre las conductas de alto riesgo es dramatica; por ejemplo, ha sido bien establecido que hay una relacion entre los accidentes de transito y el uso de alcohol; la contribucion del alcohol a la mortalidad general no se limita al transito automotor, sino que abarca un porcentaje sustancial de muertos por incendios y ahogados. Asimismo, hay una clara correlacion entre fumar y el uso de alcohol y marihuana y la iniciacion precoz de relaciones sexuales. Desde el punto de vista clinico, es importante diferenciar el uso ocasional o experimental, de su consumo habitual o sostenido. Es esta ultima situacion la que debe preocupar al equipo interdisciplinario, especialmente si se acompana de disminucion en el rendimiento escolar o de problemas de relaciones interpersonales de comienzo reciente. La busqueda de causas desencadenantes debe incluir la exploracion del ambiente familiar (un numero importante de Direccion para correspondencia: Dr. Antonio Salas Riczker, Catedra de Farmacologia, Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Iquique y Sodiro s/n, Telf. 2528690, 2528810, Quito, Ecuador. casos se relaciona con dificultades del adolescente o el joven con sus padres, de los progenitores entre si o de alguna crisis familiar cronica); en un numero menor, pero siempre significativo, es posible detectar sicopatologia individual, como desordenes afectivos o cuadros sicoticos.

Anxiety, difficulty concentrating, hunger, irritability, restlessness, and weight gain increased, and heart rate decreased, postcessation (p less than .001). Except for hunger and weight gain, these symptoms returned to precessation levels by 30 days postcessation. Craving, depression, and alcohol or caffeine intake did not reliably increase. Postcessation depression, but not withdrawal symptoms, craving, or weight gain, predicted relapse. These results are consistent with prior studies.",

K zavislosti na alkoholu dochazi tehdy, když si tělo navykne přijimat velka množstvi alkoholu natolik, že už neni schopno po nějakou delsi dobu bez alkoholu normalně fungovat. Přiznakem zavislosti je neustala chuť na alkohol, neschopnost pit umirněně, a jakmile se choroba rozvine, potřeba větsiho množstvi alkoholu k tomu, aby postižený dosahl tehož ucinku. Postižený může zacit pit proto, aby zapadl do party, aby si zvedl naladu nebo aby zapomněl na svoje starosti. Za cas zacne být jeho organismus na alkoholu zavislý, a pokud ho nedostane, zacne trpět abstinencnimi přiznaky, např. horecnatosti, nespavosti a třesem, spojenými s halucinacemi.

We present the case of a 14-year-old adolescent with chronic diarrhoea and weight loss for several months. Extensive complementary analyses were performed, all being totally negative. A careful repeated clinical history revealed that the patient had a significant nicotine intake, confirmed by a urine cotinine test. Withdrawal led to a resolution of the symptomatology. Nicotine consumption in the form of nicotine replacement products among young people is increasing rapidly. Nicotine has multiple health effects, including neurological, gastrointestinal and immune adverse effects.",

The main prolem in weaning from smoking is related to the origin of smoking which is in large measure unknown. Smoking habits should not be analyzed on an individual basis only. It represents a \"minor addiction\" with the origin within the society. This is the result of an analysis of motives leading to smoking. Social habits, examples, deprivation of senses, dullness, anxiety, stress, and smoking as a symbol of status play a major role. 3. Stress carries a dual risk, it encourages to smoking and it exerts direct effects an organ function. 4. Smoking is enhanced by its somatic effects which activate in turn again smoking. Weaning from smoking does not affect the origin of the addiction thereby remaining symptomatic treatment. 5. There is a constant replacement of old smokers with smokers originating in the young generation. Smoking habits have the tendency to spread out of the smoking population over the non-smokers. A combat against this infiltration can only be successful by creating new values and by producing a new habit of non-smoking.",

El presente trabajo evalua la influencia que a largo plazo presentan ciertas variables ambientales, individuales y biologicas durante la adolescencia, sobre la vulnerabilidad a los efectos reforzantes de la cocaina y su nivel de consumo en sujetos adultos. Concretamente, hemos comprobado como la exposicion durante la adolescencia al alcohol o cocaina en forma de binge, el nivel del rasgo de personalidad de busqueda de la novedad, o la pertenencia al genero masculino o femenino, influyen en la Autoadministracion de cocaina y en la adquisicion del Condicionamiento de Preferencia de Lugar (CPL) inducido por la cocaina u otras drogas en los ratones evaluados durante la etapa adulta. Ademas, dado que hoy por hoy no existe una terapia farmacologica eficaz para el tratamiento de la dependencia a la cocaina, el presente trabajo comprueba la capacidad del topiramato, un farmaco anticonvulsivante, para bloquear los efectos reforzantes de la cocaina. Asi, hemos evaluado ratones adultos expuestos a diferentes patrones de administracion de topiramato en la adquisicion, expresion, extincion y reinstauracion del CPL inducido con diferentes dosis de cocaina. Los principales resultados obtenidos indican que la exposicion a un consumo intensivo de drogas durante la adolescencia, el alto nivel de busqueda de la novedad y la pertenencia al sexo femenino, aumentan a largo plazo la sensibilidad a los efectos reforzantes de la cocaina, asi como su consumo, en la etapa adulta. Nuestros resultados indican que el topiramato potencia el efecto reforzante y la conducta de busqueda de la cocaina, por lo que no parece recomendable su uso en el tratamiento de la adiccion a la cocaina.

A child’s organs and immune system are not fully developed to offer protection from airborne and residual toxins compared to an adult. A child is unable to control their environment or escape their home environment, an adult can change jobs or leave a toxic environment. Thus, children are the most susceptible to the effects of toxins in their environment. Tobacco Smoke exposure is the greatest toxic exposure risk a child faces in a home environment. Tobacco Smoke exposure starts in the womb when the embryo embeds in the mother’s uterus and connects to their mother’s blood flow. Tobacco smoke contains many osteotoxic, nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic chemicals that significantly alter genetic material in the developing fetus and child, which has long-term health effects leading to poor bone health and skeletal diseases later in life. Three of the many thousands of toxins in tobacco smoke which are most osteotoxic, nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic are lead, cadmium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

There is a large group of persons who have tried PCP once or twice and discontinued using. One of the key distinctions pointed out by this exploratory study relates to the feelings of control persons have over the effects of the drug. The PCP user who is not bothered by the lack of control is more likely to feel good and party with others when using and is more likely to have high use patterns. Feelings of control over the effects of PCP indicate an important individual difference in understanding reactions to PCP use and further research should systematically examine this phenomenon. There has been a discrepancy between our conceptions of PCP use and the actual patterns of use found in the United States. It appears that at this time most persons in the drug abuse field are willing to accept the fact that PCP is a drug of choice among young people and that some as yet unspecified proportion of users is able to use PCP and avoid major problems. While there remains much speculation about the motivation for use and the effects of such use, it would apper that we are ready to engage in research which systematically looks at the spectrum of users.",

The regular use of both tobacco and cannabis is at the origin of the increase in dependence on each substance, which makes stopping this double consumption often difficult. This combined use can cause somatic and mental complications. Practitioners should identify this dual use, advise stopping and offer their help after a careful evaluation of both consumptions and their causes. The management includes psychotherapeutic support; If the efficacy of medications to aid stopping cannabis has not been proven to aid in stopping cannabis, nicotine replacement therapy can limit withdrawal syndrome, craving and improve patients' adherence to monitoring.The mobilization of practitioners in the management of patients and the development of effective cannabis cessation pharmacotherapies are essential.L’usage du cannabis est le plus souvent associé à celui du tabac. Si le pouvoir addictif du cannabis est faible, celui du tabac est élevé. L’usage régulier de tabac et de cannabis est à l’origine du renforcement de la dépendance à chaque substance, ce qui rend l’arrêt de cette double consommation souvent difficile. Ce double usage peut également être à l’origine de complications somatiques et psychiques.

La prise en charge comprend un soutien psychothérapeutique; si aucun médicament d’aide à l’arrêt du cannabis n’a fait ses preuves d’efficacité, la substitution nicotinique permet de limiter le syndrome de sevrage, le craving et d’améliorer l’adhérence des patients au suivi thérapeutique. La mobilisation des praticiens dans la prise en charge des patients et la mise au point de pharmacothérapies de sevrage du cannabis efficaces s’imposent.",

      "title": "Electronic cigarettes and nicotine dependence: evolving products, evolving problems",
      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (ECIGs) use an electric heater to aerosolize a liquid that usually contains propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavorants, and the dependence-producing drug nicotine. ECIG-induced nicotine dependence has become an important concern, as some ECIGs deliver very little nicotine while some may exceed the nicotine delivery profile of a tobacco cigarette. This variability is relevant to tobacco cigarette smokers who try to switch to ECIGs. Products with very low nicotine delivery may not substitute for tobacco cigarettes, so that ECIG use is accompanied by little reduced risk of cigarette-caused disease. Products with very high nicotine delivery may make quitting ECIGs particularly difficult should users decide to try. For non-smokers, the wide variability of ECIGs on the market is especially troublesome: low nicotine products may lead them to initiate nicotine self-administration and progress to higher dosing ECIGs or other products, and those that deliver more nicotine may produce nicotine dependence where it was not otherwise present. External regulatory action, guided by strong science, may be required to ensure that population-level nicotine dependence does not rise.",

The heavy users of alcohol should be identified both by the general practitioners and the hospital doctors in any field and the first intervention should be a health interview connected with a biological monitoring of alcohol damages and thereby many patients would be motivated for moderate drinking. If this is not the case, heavy users should be encouraged to a 6 or better a 12 months supervised treatment with Antabuse. This treatment has especially been effective in employees with work‐related alcohol problems.",

      "abstract": "La adiccion a cocaina es un fenomeno de gran importancia clinica y social. Las consecuencias negativas que produce el abuso de estas sustancias son significativas, incluyendo problemas medicos, psicosociales y laborales para los individuos afectados. Ademas, su abuso esta asociado a tasas incrementadas de crimen y violencia. La dependencia se caracteriza por tasas elevadas de recaida en un patron ciclico de busqueda y consumo. Estas recaidas pueden producirse incluso despues de periodos prolongados de abstinencia. Dadas estas premisas, uno de los principales objetivos de nuestro trabajo es la identificacion de farmacos que puedan atenuar el deseo compulsivo (“craving”) de consumir y reducir la incidencia de recaidas en animales experimentales. Ademas de mitigar el craving, estos farmacos deberian poseer un escaso o nulo potencial de abuso y carecer de los fuertes efectos psicoestimulantes caracteristicos de estas drogas. La busqueda de nuevas medicaciones para el tratamiento de la adiccion se ha centrado en la identificacion de sustancias que actuen como sustitutos de la droga estimulante produciendo efectos similares en la transmision dopaminergica y/o ejerciendo acciones antagonistas que impidan la union al transportador de dopamina. La mayoria de los esfuerzos se han centrado en el diseno de moleculas que mimeticen la union al transportador pero con un menor efecto estimulante y una accion farmacologica mas duradera. Los estudios presentados han caracterizado el potencial de abuso y e terapeutico de dos analogos derivados de la benzotropina (BZT), el AHN 1-055 y el JHW 007. Estas moleculas se caracterizan por tener una alta afinidad por el DAT y una pauta lenta y duradera de accion farmacologica. Para llevar a cabo el trabajo administramos cada uno de los analogos en combinacion con cocaina o anfetamina empleando diferentes modelos animales de adiccion a psicoestimulantes tales como actividad locomotora, sensibilizacion, preferencia de lugar condicionada (CPP) y autoadministracion (SA), acompanados de tecnicas de Western blot. Los resultados de estos ensayos han mostrado que ambos analogos no se comportan como estimulantes clasicos, mostrando significativamente menor capacidad estimulante a la vez que atenuan o bloquean completamente algunos de los efectos, tanto comportamentales como neurobiologicos inducidos tanto por los psicoestimulantes. Ademas, se muestran evidencias de que el tratamiento sustitutivo con el AHN-1055 como reduce la vulnerabilidad de recaida en individuos consumidores, apoyando la hipotesis de que pueden ser moleculas apropiadas para el tratamiento de la adiccion a los psicoestimulantes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Smoking among teens and college students is a significant public health challenge. Tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol continue to be the most commonly abused drugs by teens and young adults. Educational efforts have resulted in increased awareness of the mortality and morbidity attributed to smoking, second-hand smoke, and prenatal exposure to tobacco. Short- and long-term consequences of marijuana use are well documented in the literature, but they have received less wide spread attention. Even less well known is the relationship between these substances. Does use of one lead to use of the other? Are there synergistic and/or antagonistic effects when these substances are used together? We need answers to these questions to understand the prevalence of use and the impact of these drugs on our nations youth and young adults. The gateway theory of drug use is often used to describe the progression from using alcohol or tobacco, to marijuana, and later use of other drugs like MDMA, cocaine, and heroin. While tobacco use does commonly precede marijuana use, we propose that marijuana may be a \"gateway drug\" to tobacco smoking. Our research with university students is suggesting that cigarette-smoking initiation often follows or coincides with marijuana use.",

      "title": "Effects of Nicotine on the Central Nervous System and Sleep Quality in Relation to Other Stimulants: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Nicotine is used extensively across the globe despite the common awareness of the fact that it might stimulate the neurological system in those who indulge in its consumption. Nicotine can be consumed in a wide number of various forms and can also be delivered in a wide variety of different ways. After it has been heated, it can be smoked, consumed sublingually, or brought into touch with mucosal surfaces, with the buccal mucosa being the most popular one. These three methods of consumption account for the vast majority of its use. It has been demonstrated without a reasonable doubt that people who partake in nicotine do, in fact, experience an increase in their levels of alertness, wakefulness, attention, and focus. The half-life of the substance, in addition to its effects, is highly variable depending on the forms in which it is consumed, viz. cigarettes, tobacco, gums, lozenges, and the manner in which it is administered. This is the case regardless of whether the chemical is administered orally or intravenously. It is common for a person to require multiple \"hits\" of the chemical throughout the course of the day, though the frequency of these needs and the intervals between them can vary greatly. The time interval between each of these \"hits\" can range anywhere from a few hours to a few minutes. The user has the potential to develop a tolerance to the neurostimulatory and systemic effects of nicotine, as well as a heightened sensitivity to those effects, and even hereditary predispositions to specific adverse consequences. There is also a possibility that the user will develop an addiction to nicotine. This literature review aims to explore the relationship between nicotine consumption and its effects on the central nervous system, especially on sleep.",

These undesirable symptoms are similar to the side effects that occur to oncological patients after the administration of chemotherapy. : Descriptive research method was used.

Alcohol addiction forces patients to search for a way to avoid the unwanted reactions. Sometimes, patients tend to be quite ingenious while trying to suppress the arising side effects. In many cases, it involves the usage of additional medication. : When alcohol addiction overpowers, the patient tries to reduce the undesirable symptoms and may even die if alcohol is combined with disulfiram.

      "abstract": "Tobacco use is a single leading preventable cause of death worldwide. It contains nicotine, which is one of the most addictive psychoactive drugs; thus, successful quitting becomes a challenging process. Occupation has a profound influence on tobacco use patterns, and in the majority of scenarios, users are unable to achieve abstinence to maintain the need for the psychoactive effect of nicotine to cope up with job stresses and to remain energetic. Various tobacco cessation aids are available with variable success rates. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vaping has become popular, particularly in Western Countries and among occupational workers as they contain less harmful chemicals than combustible cigarettes and can help heavy smokers to quit the habit. Reports of short- and long-term health effects of vaping have currently led to a ban on the production, manufacturing, and advertising of e-cigarettes. Pharmacological interventions such as bupropion and varenicline have been proven to provide long-term abstinence; however, neuropsychiatric side effects limit their use. This paper focusses on the hypothesis that whether the electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) or vaping and pharmacological interventions are an effective tobacco cessation interventions.",

      "abstract": "One person dies every six seconds from a smoking-related disease and this problem is likely to worsen. While many people try to quit smoking on their own or with using medicinal products, many of them fail. There is an ongoing debate within the public health community about e-cigarettes on whether they have a potential role in smoking cessation, whether their use can reduce harm for individual users, whether the widespread use of these devices has the potential to reduce or increase population-level harm, and how best to regulate e-cigarette use to minimize both individual and population-level harm. Although the long-term effects of e-cigarette use among smokers and non-smokers are not known, nicotine aerosol produced from a solution, rather than from burning tobacco, releases fewer harmful substances than cigarette smoke does. Some experts advocate wider availability and softer regulations regarding e-cigarette use and perceive them as having the potential to help smokers quit or switch to a harm-reducing means of consuming nicotine. Based on scientific evidence on e-cigarettes, this article explores its pros and cons to public health in order to guide practice, policy, and regulation through reviews of debate articles. 'Quit or die' is no longer the only option for those who cannot quit. Safer nicotine products offer another way. There is substantial international and independent evidence that these products are safer than cigarettes.",

      "title": "PREVALÊNCIA DE UTILIZAÇÃO DO ÁLCOOL NA ADOLESCÊNCIA E EFEITOS TOXICOLÓGICOS DE SEU ABUSO",
      "abstract": "Introducao: O uso de alcool entre adolescentes e, naturalmente, um tema controverso no meio social e academico brasileiro. Ao mesmo tempo em que a lei brasileira define como proibida a venda de bebidas alcoolicas para menores de 18 anos, e pratica comum o consumo de alcool pelos jovens, seja no ambiente domiciliar, em festividades, ou mesmo em ambientes publicos. Aqueles que sao coniventes com esse comportamento devem se conscientizar de que as consequencias negativas ligadas ao uso do alcool podem ter grande impacto na vida desses adolescentes, como um pior rendimento nos estudos, problemas sociais, pratica de sexo sem protecao e/ou sem consentimento, maior risco de suicidio ou homicidio, e acidentes relacionados ao consumo. Os adolescentes do sexo masculinos mais velhos, que vivem em areas urbanas, foram os mais propensos a apresentar doencas relacionadas ao alcool e ao fumo.  Alem disso, as principais razoes para o uso pesado/frequente de alcool sao o prazer, diversao e ansiedade. Quanto a depressao, relata-se que quase um terco dos participantes informou ter sofrido desse mal, alem de serem duas vezes mais propensos a ter transtornos relacionados ao uso do alcool. A sociedade como um todo adota atitudes paradoxais frente ao tema: por um lado condena o abuso de alcool pelos jovens, mas e tipicamente permissiva ao estimulo do consumo por meio da propaganda. Objetivo: Este estudo objetivou descrever a prevalencia do consumo de alcool entre adolescentes, bem como ressaltar os impactos sociais do entre jovens e evidenciar os efeitos toxicos do mesmo. Metodologia: Atraves de um levantamento de revisao sistematica bibliografica foram pesquisados os bancos de dados Google Academico e Scielo sendo utilizados os termos chaves: alcoolismo na adolescencia,alcool e jovens. Foram utilizados como limites artigos publicados desde o ano 2010 e no idioma portugues. A busca bibliografica resultou em cinco artigos que representaram o tema. Resultados : A populacao de adolescentes dos estudos esteve compreendia com idades entre 10-20 anos de idade. A acao do alcool no organismo inclui a degeneracao das celulas cerebrais, o aumento da pressao arterial e dos batimentos cardiacos, alem do aparecimento de ulceras e cirrose como condicoes de toxicidade em longo prazo. Desta forma entende-se pertinente o estudo da epidemiologia do uso do alcool por adolescentes, desvendando sua influencia sobre a saude dos jovens, o impacto emocional e social deste vicio e as formas de consumo nos dias atuais, bem como os fatores da sociedade contemporânea que influenciam este uso. C onclusao: O consumo de alcool por adolescentes ainda tem elementos controversos para sua compreensao. Apesar de trazer claras consequencias orgânicas, comportamentais e na estrutura de desenvolvimento da personalidade do jovem o uso do alcool por adolescentes e uma realidade em distintos contextos sociais. Alem da necessidade de se preencher a atual lacuna no setor da saude e bem-estar social para adolescentes, sao necessarias acoes voltadas para o ambiente familiar e potenciais fatores de protecao e de risco que envolve os habitos dos pais.",

Everybody has collected his own experience with it and tried different methods to avoid withdrawal symptoms and the urge to start smoking again. During the last decades, many different methods for the therapy of smoking cessation have been applied. These techniques were often developed with the help of individual experiences. Many times, there is a lack of a scientific ground and verifiable investigations for these activities. The most important parameter for the smoking cessation is the clear and strong intention to quit. This intention may be supported by different methods. The mental requirements are discussed and the numerous methods and drugs available to quit smoking are described.",

Nicotine is the main psychoactive drug responsible for the addictive nature of tobacco, explaining why many smokers fail to quit without assistance. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is deemed effective for a broad range of populations and should be routinely offered to smokers interested in making a quit attempt. Varenicline, a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic receptor increases chances of quitting three-fold compared to placebo in smokers without comorbidities, and in smokers with cardiovascular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Persons with mental illness have high rates of smoking, and the potential impact of varenicline on mental status and the underlying pathophysiology of mental illness, has become a salient concern. Varenicline is an appropriate aid for smoking cessation in patients with medical and/or psychiatric comorbidity. This conclusion is supported by current evidence on the safety and tolerability of the drug.",

      "abstract": "Cuando se desea examinar y evaluar las politicas de drogas, es util distinguir entre problemas de drogas primarios y secundarios (L. Hulsman y H. Van Ransbeek, 1983). Problemas de drogas primarios son los relacionados con las drogas que se producen con independencia de la politica de drogas que se siga en el sector colectivo; problemas de drogas secundarios son aquellos que estan relacionados especificamente con una determinada politica de drogas y que no ocurririan de esta manera si se adoptara una politica de drogas diferente. Tomemos algunos ejemplos de problemas primarios en materia de drogas. Un consumidor de drogas puede sufrir danos en su salud fisica: cirrosis, como consecuencia del alcohol, o una enfermedad pulmonar, como consecuencia de fumar cigarrillos regularmente. El dano puede tambien referirse a su salud mental: algunas sicosis se manifiestan despues del consumo de alcohol o de LSD. La dependencia fisica o sicologica puede convertirse en una carga. El consumo de droga puede convertirse en el punto central de la vida, impidiendo el desarrollo personal. Todos estos problemas que afectan al consumidor de drogas, afectan tambien a menudo a su medio inmediato: su familia, sus amigos y sus colegas en el lugar de trabajo. El consumo de drogas puede tambien presentar problemas primarios para un mas amplio medio circundante del consumidor. Algunas personas son propensas a volverse violentas despues del consumo excesivo de alcohol. La combinacion de consumo de alcohol con la conduccion de vehiculos motorizados presenta riesgos especiales para los otros usuarios de la carretera. Ninguno de estos problemas primarios de las drogas esta especificamente ligado al consumo de heroina, cocaina u otras drogas ilegales. El alcohol, el tabaco y las drogas medicinales pueden producir problemas de esta naturaleza (Plant. 1981). Los problemas secundarios de drogas estan especificamente relacionados con las drogas ilegales. Veamos mas de cerca algunos de estos problemas secundarios de drogas. Quiero hacer una distincion entre: 1) problemas secundarios para el consumidor; 2) problemas secundarios para el medio ambiente del consumidor; 3) problemas secundarios para la justicia criminal; y 4) problemas secundarios para el sistema medico-social.

      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a spiraling and debilitating condition that has severe social and economic consequences for the individual and society. Recently, much work has examined the relationship between drug addiction and the circadian timing system. The master circadian pacemaker directs a daily temporal rhythm throughout the brain and body including the consumption of alcohol. Many drugs, including alcohol, can have myriad effects at different times of day. Conversely, alcohol can alter circadian physiology at multiple levels within the system. Few studies, however, have examined the role that the timing of chronic drug exposure and withdrawal plays in the development and maintenance of drug addiction. Alcohol use, for example, follows a circadian pattern with consumption peaking in the early evening in non-dependent individuals and withdrawal likely occurring late at night. In the transition to dependence, however, craving and consumption expand earlier into the day. What consequences this altered timing of drug use plays in the physiological and psychological consequences of drug addiction remains to be seen. Herein, we specifically examine if: 1) controlling for time of day in alcohol exposure/withdrawal can alter the development of physical dependence, 2) the development of psychological dependence, and 3) if time of day can become a conditioned environmental cue that triggers craving and behavioral sensitization in an amphetamine model of addiction",

However, severe reactions can develop, and a small proportion of these may be life-threatening. Before discussing specific drug eruptions, we should like to discuss the proof of a causal relationship between a given drug and an eruption. It is difficult to prove the precise etiologic agent for any suspected eruption. The only way to prove definitively that a given drug has caused an eruption is to discontinue the suspected drug, wait until the reaction clears, and then readminister the drug to observe if a relapse occurs. If the condition improves and ultimately clears entirely when the drug is withdrawn, and reappears when the drug subsequently is readministered, the drug may be regarded as the causal agent. However, readministering the suspected drug is very hazardous, and<i>we must emphasize</i>",

      "abstract": "º III » Le terme « tabagisme », issu du vocabulaire médical, qualifie l'intoxication aiguë ou chronique par des quantités abusives de tabac, bien que depuis longtemps il soit à tort utilisé pour désigner la simple consommation de ce dernier.Le tabagisme dit « actif » est, par opposition au tabagisme passif, l'inhalation volontaire de la fumée de tabac contenue dans une cigarette, un cigare ou une pipe ainsi que la consommation des formes de tabac non fumées.Le tabagisme passif est quant à lui l'inhalation involontaire de la fumée dégagée par la cigarette ou le cigare laissé par exemple dans le cendrier, ou encore exhalé par un ou plusieurs fumeurs.Le tabac est un facteur de risque important dans l'apparition des maladies cardiovasculaires, pulmonaires et des cancers, les populations de fumeurs présentant au même âge une morbi-mortalité plus élevée que les non-fumeurs.Fumer altère le fonctionnement et/ou l'intégrité de tous les organes du corps humain et le sevrage tabagique, quel que soit l'âge auquel il est initié, conduit rapidement à une amélioration de l'état de santé de l'individu et à une réduction significative des risques liés au tabagisme.Malgré de nombreuses hausses du prix du tabac décidées par les gouvernements successifs, fumer ne coûte pas encore assez cher pour décourager la plupart des consommateurs.Bien que le « budget cigarettes » puisse être parfois conséquent, il ne ruine pas comme cela peut être le cas lors de la consommation d'autres drogues moins accessibles.Il s'agit donc d'une addiction qui reste abordable, et ce, même chez les plus jeunes.Le tabagisme est d'ailleurs répandu dans toutes les classes sociales, surtout les plus modestes.Enfin, il semble indispensable de rappeler que le tabac est actuellement parfaitement légal malgré les effets néfastes qui lui sont attribués et qu'il constitue même une source de revenus non négligeable pour l'État.Contrairement à d'autres addictions comme l'alcoolisme, le tabac n'entraîne ni déchéance intellectuelle, ni ivresse, et par conséquent ne perturbe pas le fonctionnement familial ou socioprofessionnel.Le regard social sur le tabac est donc très différent de celui que l'on a sur l'alcool ou d'autres drogues.En effet, le tabagisme est toléré, accepté, voire même par certains, encouragé.Ces éléments font la particularité de cette drogue et augmentent son danger.Le tabac tue en silence et c'est particulièrement l'initiale discrétion et la latence de ses effets qui le rendent dangereux.Nous savons pertinemment que les maladies qui affectent le plus une",

      "title": "Einfluss des Rauchens auf das Riechvermögen des Menschen",
      "abstract": "Der Riechsinn des Menschen ist uber viele Jahre hinweg als weniger wichtig als z.B. das Sehen und das Horen angesehen worden. Erst in den letzten Jahren und Jahrzehnten hat das klinisch-wissenschaftliche Interesse am Riechsinn zugenommen. So konnten vielfaltigste Ursachen und Mechanismen von Riechstorungen entdeckt und zahlreiche Verfahren zur Testung des Riechsinnes etabliert werden. Die Wirkung des Rauchens auf den Riechsinn konnte allerdings trotz einiger Anstrengungen und Untersuchungen nicht abschliesend geklart werden. Vereinzelte Arbeiten stellen keinerlei schadliche Wirkung des Rauchens auf den Riechsinn fest, wahrend andere Veroffentlichungen sehr wohl negative Einflusse des Rauchens auf das Riechvermogen des Menschen beschreiben. Allerdings wird diese Schadigung von einigen Autoren als kurzfristig und reversibel, von anderen dagegen als langfristig und irreversibel interpretiert. So war es das Ziel dieser Arbeit, den zeitlichen Charakter des Einflusses des Rauchens auf das Riechvermogen junger Menschen genauer zu beleuchten. Schadigt das Rauchen das Riechvermogen, und wenn ja, ist dieser Schaden von kurzfristigem oder von langfristigem Charakter, oder lasst sich eine solch strikte Trennung moglicherweise gar nicht durchfuhren? So soll letztlich eine Aussage daruber getroffen werden, ob der Raucherstatus in der Ermittlung von Riechnormwerten Berucksichtigung finden muss. Deshalb wurden zwischen Juni 2009 und Juni 2010 in der HNO-Universitatsklinik in Jena 40 Raucher und 43 Nieraucher auf ihr Riechvermogen hin mit Hilfe der Sniffin’ Sticks Testbatterie untersucht. Alle Probanden mussten zwischen 18 und 35 Jahren alt sein und durften nicht unter Krankheiten leiden, welche das Riechvermogen beeinflussen. So wurden z.B. Nasenpolypen durch eine anteriore Rhinoskopie ausgeschlossen. Nach einer ersten Riechtestung zu Testbeginn mussten sich die Raucher einer zweistundigen Rauchkarenz unterziehen, um danach einen Riechwert zu ermitteln. Danach wurden sie aufgefordert, eine Zigarette zu rauchen, ehe im Anschluss wieder mehrfach das Riechvermogen getestet wurde. Die Nieraucher hingegen unterzogen sich als Kontrollgruppe lediglich zwei Riechtestungen. Die Daten der Riechtestungen sowie parallel erhobene Blutdruck- und Pulswerte sowie einige Angaben, die in einem Fragebogen ermittelt wurden (u.a. eine Selbsteinschatzung des Riechvermogens) wurden mit Hilfe von SPSS statistisch ausgewertet. Es zeigte sich, dass die Raucher signifikant schlechtere Riechwerte als die Nieraucher erzielten. Aber direkt nach Einhaltung der zweistundigen Rauchkarenz verbesserte sich das Riechvermogen der Raucher kurzfristig auf das Niveau der Nieraucher. Auch in allen Teiltesten der Sniffin’ Sticks Testbatterie (Riechschwellen-, Diskriminations- und Identifikationstestung) zeigten sich diese Ergebnisse. Auserdem wiesen Raucher, die mehr als 7,5 packyears hatten (n=19), insgesamt schlechtere Riechwerte auf als Raucher, die weniger als 7,5 packyears hatten (n=21). Zusatzlich zeigte sich eine signifikante negative Korrelation zwischen Riechvermogen insgesamt und packyears. Die weiblichen Probanden erzielten bessere Riechergebnisse als die mannlichen Probanden, Altersunterschiede im Riechvermogen traten nicht auf. Auch zeigte sich, dass Raucher und Nieraucher ihr eigenes Riechvermogen nur sehr ungenau einschatzten und, dass Blutdruck und Puls zwar durch das Rauchen einer Zigarette akut anstiegen, nach 30minutiger Rauchkarenz aber auch wieder absanken. Es muss also festgestellt werden, dass das Rauchen einen schadigenden Einfluss auf das Riechvermogen des Menschen ausubt. Akutes Rauchen einer Zigarette fuhrt dabei in erster Linie zu kurzfristigen und reversiblen Schaden, denn schon eine zweistundige Rauchkarenz hat eine Verbesserung des Riechvermogens auf das Niveau von Nierauchern zur Folge. Chronisches Rauchen mit einer erreichten Zigarettendosis von mehr als 7,5 packyears fuhrt zusatzlich auch zu langfristigen Schadigungen des Riechvermogens. So wurden signifikant schlechtere SDI-Werte bei einer Dosis von mehr als 7,5 packyears gemessen. Die Geschlechtszugehorigkeit ubte einen schwacheren Einfluss auf das Riechvermogen aus, als die erreichte Zigarettendosis. Bei einem Probandenalter von maximal 35 Jahren bleibt das individuelle Alter ohne Einfluss. Die Ungenauigkeit in der Selbsteinschatzung des eigenen Riechvermogens macht subjektive und objektive Testverfahren in der Ermittlung des Riechvermogens eines Menschen unverzichtbar. Insgesamt muss gefolgert werden, dass der Rauchstatus und die erreichte Zigarettendosis bei der Ermittlung von Riechnormwerten berucksichtigt werden sollten. Auserdem sollte vor jeder Messung der Riechfunktion eine Rauchkarenz von zwei Stunden eingehalten werden.",

E-cigarettes are devices that aerosolize nicotine- or cannabis-based concentrates mixed with other solvents and have been marketed as an alternative to cigarettes. E-cigarette use, or vaping, is increasingly popular but has not been proven to be an innocuous substitute for traditional smoking. Several patterns of vaping-associated inhalational lung injuries have been reported in the past few years. This article reviews many of the imaging patterns that have been encountered in association with e-cigarette use. CONCLUSION. E-cigarette use is associated with a range of lung injury patterns that have only recently been recognized as use of these products continues to rise. When the radiologist sees one of these patterns of lung injury, it is important to raise the possibility of vaping-induced lung injury because cessation of vaping is an important step in treatment.",

The physician's awareness of this risk helps in the prevention of dependence. Four variables play a part in the development of dependence, ie, dose, duration of treatment, the history, and the patient's personality. A dosage higher than the usual therapeutic dose not only is not needed in most patients but produces more side effects. Short term therapy carries a low risk of dependence and is preferred. It is advisable not to use benzodiazepines in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse, as dependent personalities pose a higher risk than other personality types.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Though cocaine has been used by man for centuries for both medical and nonmedical reasons, a knowledge of its effect on the human mind and body remains limited and not yet clearly documented. Sources of information consist of myth, street knowledge, animal studies, and clinical and laboratory studies of man. This paper focuses on findings from the latter two sources. The biological effects of cocaine include the local effects of producing anesthesia and constriction of blood vessels in areas where it is applied topically. Solutions of the drug applied directly to the eye cause the pupils to dilate. Systemic effects include an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. In some individuals, an increase in alertness occurs, and in others a state of drowsiness. The drug also decreases total sleep, REM sleep, and appetite. The psychological effects of the drug vary with dosage, chronicity, and a host of other variables. Increasing doses over long periods of time appear to cause increasingly severe impairment of affective and cognitive functioning. These effects include a strong psychological craving, making cocaine one of the most powerfully reinforcing of all known substances. In addition, cocaine may induce symptoms ranging from mild euphoria to hyperalertness, hyperactivity, anorexia, insomnia, hypersexuality, and proneness to violence. In others, cocaine may produce sadness, melancholia, apathy, and various symptoms of dysphoria. Depression has been reported to occur in people who stop taking the drug, especially those who have taken the drug intravenously. At high doses taken over a long period of time, cocaine may produce symptoms that mimic acute paranoid psychosis with hallucinations, stereotyped behavior, paranoid delusions, insomnia, and proneness to violence. Finally, cocaine may cause delirium, convulsions, and death from cardiorespiratory failure. With over 30 million individuals in the college age group reported to have taken cocaine, college health personnel must be prepared to diagnose and treat symptoms resulting from cocaine toxicity.",

      "title": "Smoked Marijuana as a Cause of Lung Injury",
      "abstract": "In many societies, marijuana is the second most commonly smoked substance after tobacco. While delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is unique to marijuana and nicotine to tobacco, the smoke of marijuana, like that of tobacco, consists of a toxic mixture of gases and particulates, many of which are known to be harmful to the lung. Although far fewer marijuana than tobacco cigarettes are generally smoked on a daily basis, the pulmonary consequences of marijuana smoking may be magnified by the greater deposition of smoke particulates in the lung due to the differing manner in which marijuana is smoked. Whereas THC causes modest short-term bronchodilation, regular marijuana smoking produces a number of long-term pulmonary consequences, including chronic cough and sputum, histopathologic evidence of widespread airway inflammation and injury and immunohistochemical evidence of dysregulated growth of respiratory epithelial cells, that may be precursors to lung cancer. The THC in marijuana could contribute to some of these injurious changes through its ability to augment oxidative stress, cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibit apoptosis. On the other hand, physiologic, clinical or epidemiologic evidence that marijuana smoking may lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or respiratory cancer is limited and inconsistent. Habitual use of marijuana is also associated with abnormalities in the structure and function of alveolar macrophages, including impairment in microbial phagocytosis and killing that is associated with defective production of immunostimulatory cytokines and nitric oxide, thereby potentially predisposing to pulmonary infection. In view of the growing interest in medicinal marijuana, further epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify the true risks of regular marijuana smoking on respiratory health.",

Most people continue to smoke because they are tobacco dependent. This dependence is the result of the effect of repeated nicotine delivery to the brain, which is coupled with smoking behavior and the sensations and cues that are associated with it. Within a relatively short time a 'drive' or 'hunger' is created that only smoking can satisfy. Periods of abstinence produce urges to smoke, or cravings for a cigarette, as well as a number of other symptoms that can make it difficult to maintain abstinence. These symptoms typically peak within the first 2 weeks of stopping smoking and dissipate over time [2]. In addition, one of the main reasons people smoke so frequently throughout the day is believed to be to stave off withdrawal symptoms before they manifest.",

Of the tranquillizers, prochlorperazine and trifluoperazine may be useful; in patients who fail to respond, other preparations such as thioridazine may be used. Dosage and choice of preparation vary for different children. Long‐continued administration should not be permitted without testing the effect of gradual withdrawal.

Substance use, including heavy drinking, often occurs at the expense of other, substance-free, activities. This review examines the promotion of one specific substance-free activity—exercise—as an intervention for hazardous drinking. Exercise has numerous physical and mental health benefits, and data suggest that students who engage in exercise regularly are less likely to drink heavily. However, the adherence to exercise necessary to achieve these benefits and possibly reduce drinking is poor, and improved exercise adherence interventions are needed. A novel combination of motivational enhancement therapy and contingency management is discussed as a means to address the critical issue of exercise adherence.",

How can a physician help such a patient overcome his psychological need for smoking? My observations show that, when a heavy smoker is not smoking, he often unconsciously hypoventilates to a marked degree (Syndrome of Spontaneous Hypoventilation, Mississippi Valley M.

      "title": "Exploring young people's concepts of smoking addiction: Perceived opportunities to try smoking without becoming addicted",
      "abstract": "This study explores how young people conceptualise addiction to smoking and, also the relationship between young people's addiction beliefs and intentions to smoke cigarettes. Addiction to smoking is a major health problem, not just for adults, but also for young smokers, up to 60% of whom are dependent on nicotine. However, anti-smoking prevention efforts targeted at young people generally emphasise ill-health effects and little attention is paid to addiction education which is generally considered relevant only to adult smoking and cessation efforts. Perhaps as a consequence, young people appear to have many misconceptions and unrealistic ideas about addiction, and these may possibly have influenced initial decisions to take up smoking. For example, between 50% and 60% of young smokers believe that it would be easy or very easy to stop smoking altogether if and when they choose to and the majority of daily smokers mistakenly believe that they will not be smoking for more than five years. For these young smokers, becoming addicted is often an unforeseen consequence and most are surprised to find that they cannot give up smoking as easily as they thought. The majority of addicted smokers regret ever taking up smoking but nevertheless continue to smoke cigarettes for perhaps 30 to 40 years because they find it very difficult to stop. This backdrop provides the impetus for the present study.",

      "title": "Restriktive Flüssigkeitszufuhr in der Terminalphase kann Leiden reduzieren",
      "abstract": "Das Für und Wider von künstlicher Ernährung inkl. Flüssigkeitszufuhr am Lebensende ist häufig Quelle von Auseinandersetzungen. Leiden Sterbende unter Hunger, weil sie nicht mehr essen – muss man sie also künstlich ernähren, spüren Sterbende Atemnot, weil sie aufhören zu atmen – muss man sie also künstlich beatmen? Vergleichbares kann zum Durst ausgeführt werden, weiß man doch schon lange, dass künstliche Flüssigkeitszufuhr zumeist nicht geeignet ist, den Durst zu löschen [6]. Auf jeden Fall wird in diesen Situationen unabhängig von einer künstlichen Flüssigkeitszufuhr immer die konsequente und phantasievolle Mundpflege notwendig sein: So können etwa Sprühflaschen benutzt werden und kleine Eisstücke aus dem Lieblingsgetränk in den Mund gelegt werden [5]. Als Nachteile einer künstlichen Flüssigkeitszufuhr werden etwa die Zunahme von Ödemen, die Abhängigkeit von Pflegepersonal oder Ärzten oder die Verlängerung des Todesrasselns genannt [5, 7]. Todesrasseln und Atemnot sind die häufigsten belastenden Symptome in der Finalphase [6]. In einer Auswertung von 57 Sterbebegleitungen im Hospiz St. Hildegard, Bochum, aus dem Jahr 2004 wurde in keinem Fall ein Todesrasseln über mehr als 12 Stunden beobachtet, wenn entsprechend dem Patientenwillen allenfalls eine geringe künstliche Flüssigkeitszufuhr bei sorgfältiger Mundpflege erfolgte. Nur bei 8 Gästen (14%) trat überhaupt ein Todesrasseln auf. Bei 5 Gästen (63%) dieser Gruppe war eine ärztliche Symptomkontrolle aufgrund objektiver Stresszeichen (z.B. fahrige Armbewegungen, Schwitzen, Stöhnen, Tränenlaufen) notwendig. Demgegenüber erfolgte nur bei 8 von 49 Gästen ohne dieses Symptom ein ärztliches Eingreifen in der Sterbephase (16%). Die Dauer des Todesrasselns wird mit durchschnittlich 57 Stunden angegeben [2], Angaben zur Inzidenz variieren zwischen 23–80% [4, 7]. Während die Sterbephase unter Exsikkose von Beobachtern durchweg als nicht qualvoll und friedlich beschrieben wird, erzeugt das mitunter laute Todesrasseln nicht nur bei Angehörigen und Pflegenden den Anschein eines qualvollen Todeskampfes, oft ergeben sich hier aus palliativmedizinischer Sicht objektive Zeichen des Stresses, die einer invasiven Symptomkontrolle bedürfen. Eine unbefriedigende Symptomkontrolle trotz Therapie wird bei ca. 30% dieser Patienten angegeben [3]. Aktuelle palliativmedizinische Literatur empfiehlt letztlich die künstliche Flüssigkeitszufuhr bei Verdacht auf das Vorliegen einer behandelbaren Störung (z.B. Verwirrung infolge Dehydratation. Ohne Symptome wird lediglich der Einsatz einer phantasievollen Mundpflege empfohlen [1, 5]. Dies können wir anhand unserer Erfahrungen bestätigen. Voraussetzung für jede Entscheidung am Lebensende sind die konsequente Behandlung sämtlicher Symptome und die Aufklärung aller Beteiligten, auch der Angehörigen und Pflegenden.",

      "title": "Alcohol withdrawal: an adaptation to heavy drinking of no practical significance?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Markedly differing views can be found among both clinicians and researchers regarding whether alcohol withdrawal is a phenomenon of any practical or theoretical importance. Evidence has mounted that alcohol withdrawal, even in a severe form, is rarely life–threatening and the great majority of cases can be managed in non–medical settings, including the home. There is also a widely held view among clinicians that withdrawal symptoms have little motivational significance and may be best regarded as but epiphenomena of prolonged heavy drinking. There are also experimental data from both human and animal laboratory studies to the effect that withdrawal symptoms do not readily trigger further alcohol consumption. Against this most unpromising background a case is presented for alcohol withdrawal being but one manifestation of important biological and psychological adaptive processes which occur almost whenever alcohol is consumed with any regularity. It is proposed that understanding this more general phenomenon is critical to a better understanding of the factors which maintain heavy and problematic drinking. Recent evidence also suggests that minor alcohol withdrawal symptoms are far more common in the general population than had previously been realized, and that this has important implications for prevention policy.",

      "title": "Recent Patterns of Abuse of and Dependence on Drugs",
      "abstract": "Résumé —L'abus des drogues et l'habitude d'en dépendre constituent un problème important, répandu et croissant dans de nombreuses parties du monde. Dans certains pays les problèmes causés par l'habitude de dépendre d'une drogue donnée peuvent même être supérieurs á ce qui peut être supposé, étant donné que l'on s'aperçoit habituellement qu'une fois que les docteurs se sont rendus compte de la possibilité de l'existence d'un tel problème le diagnostic est établi bien plus fréquemment. En dehors du fait d'être responsables de la détérioration mentale et physique de l'adonnéá la drogue individuel, l'abus des drogues et l'habitude d'en dépendre ont aussi de sérieuses implications économiques et sociales en causant la préoccupation de l'sager par rapport á la drogue, la perte d'emplois qu'accompagne l'appauvrissement de la famille, l'entraînant dans des activités dépourvues d'un sens social et anti‐sociales, altérant l'habileté de sa conduite, et ainsi de suite. Les problèmes produits par l'abus des narcotiques et du cannabis sont connus depuis de nombreuses années, et quelques pays qui auparavant n‘étaient pas très touchés par de tels abus ont récemment été témoins de l'apparition de tels problèmes, en particulier chez les très jeunes. L'abus et l'habitude de dépendre de façons croissantes de différents genres de drogues chez les jeunes se sont révélés comme un facteur important sur le plan international des drogues ces dernières années, non seulement en ce qui concerne les drogues telles que l'héroïne, la cocaïne et le cannabis, mais aussi dans le cas de drogues stimulantes telles que les amphétamines. L'emploi de drogues influençant les perceptions autres que les opiates, á savoir des sédatifs, des stimulants et des calmants a augmenté de façon prononcée dans le monde entier, á tel point qu’á la dernière séance en 1965 de la Commision sur les Narcotiques, certains observateurs eurent le sentiment “qu'il pourrait arriver une époque où le problème de l'abus des soporifiques, des calmants et des stimulants pourrait éclipser celui de l'abus des narcotiques”. Il est évident qu'il se présente un grand besoin de recherche pour établir les faits, aussi bien que de l'éducation du public professionnel et du public non éclairé dans le domaine se rapportant á l'abus des drogues et á l'habitude d'en dépendre. Zusammenfassung —Der Missbrauch und die Abhängigkeit von Rauschgiftmitteln stellen ein bedeutsames, weitverbreitetes und anwachsendes Problem in vielen Teilen der Welt dar. In gewissen Ländern mag die Abhängigkeit von einem gegebenen Rauschgift sogar grösser als angenommen sein, da man gewöhnlich findet, dass, falls den Ärzten einmal die Möglichkeit des Bestehens eines solchen Problems zum Bewusstsein kommt, diese Diagnose viel häufiger gestellt wird. Ausser der Verantwortlichkeit für geistigen und körperlichen Verfall des dem Rauschgift ergebenen Individuums bringen der Missbrauch und die Abhängigkeit von Rausch‐giften auch noch schwere sozial‐ökonomische Begleiterscheinungen mit sich, indem sie Voreingenommenheit mit Rauschgift zur Hauptbeschäftigung des Verbrauchers gestalten, Berufsverlust und Verarmung der Familie verursachen und ihn in eigenbrötlerische und antisoziale Tätigkeiten verwickeln, sowie auch seine Fahrgeschicklichkeit u.s.w. beeinträchtigen. Die Probleme, die durch den Missbrauch von narkotischen Giften und Hanf hervor‐gerufen werden, sind seit vielen Jahren bekannt und viele Länder, welcher früher von diesem Missbrauch nicht sonderlich betroffen waren, beobachteten kürzlich das Auftauchen solcher Probleme, inbesonders unter sehr jungen Leuten. Der wachsende Missbrauch und die Abhängigkeit von verschiedenen Rauschgiftarten unter jungen Menschen repräsen‐tierte in den jüngsten Jahren einen bedeutsamen Faktor auf dem internationalem Rausch‐giftfeld, nicht bloss in Bezug auf Rauschgifte wie Heroin, Kokain und Hanf, sondern auch auf Reizdrogen wie Benzedrin. Die Verwendung von anderen Rauschgiften als Betäubungsmittel, welche das zentrale Nervensystem angreifen, nämlich schmerzstillende, Reiz‐ und Beruhigungsmittel, hat auf der ganzen Welt ausgesprochen zugenommen; tatsächlich so sehr, dass bei der letzten Tagung in 1965 der Kommission für Narkotische Drogen einige Beobachter der Eindruck hatten, dass “die Zeit kommenz würde, wenn das Problem des Missbrauchs von Schlafmitteln, Beruhigungsmitteln und ‘Pep’‐(Aufmunterungs‐) mitteln das des Missbrauches von narkotischen Drogen überschatten würde. Offensichtlich besteht ein grosses Bedürfnis für faktenfindende Forschung sowie auch für Schulung des professionellen und Laienpublikums auf dem Gebiete des Rauschgiftmissbrauches und der Rauschgiftabhängigkeit.",

Literature pertaining to the prevalence, clinical significance and toxicity of this practice is reviewed, using illustrative cases from a series of 48 NBA consumers. It was found that 10-15% of alcoholics hospitalized in detoxication units have consumed NBA; half of these patients are regular consumers. Addiction to NBA itself may occur. Its use is primarily related to easy accessibility, rather than social or monetary factors. Polydrug misuse and antisocial personality disorder are more frequent in NBA users, but use is not pathognomic of end-stage alcoholism. The 48 NBA users reported surprisingly few toxic symptoms from acute ingestion, perhaps because tolerance to some substances in NBA may occur. Isopropyl alcohol was the exception, reproducibly causing symptoms suggestive of severe gastritis.",

Due to anonymity, its wide reach and the infinite stream of information from the Internet, almost anything can be found on it. This includes medicines that can normally only be acquired by way of a doctor's prescription.A 27-year-old man made a suicide attempt using psychoactive drugs he got from an illegal website in India. This caused him to develop status epilepticus, rhabdomyolysis, renal insufficiency and pulmonary oedema for which he had to be admitted to intensive care. The patient was treated with medicine, cardioversion, ventilation and haemofiltration and recovered. He was referred to a psychiatric centre.The number of illegal online pharmaceutical websites on the Internet has increased drastically in the last decade. These websites sell medicines without prescription to consumers and the traditional doctor/patient consultation does not therefore take place. Many medicines that are delivered contain the wrong concentration or the wrong active ingredient and are often contaminated with other substances. The ease with which this life-threatening medicine can be ordered online without a doctor's supervision is a possible risk to public health.",

      "title": "The Debate Surrounding Slow-Release Oxycodone",
      "abstract": "In recent weeks there have been numerous media reports of deaths among young people experimenting with illegal use of a slow-release oxycodone preparation. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a strong warning regarding this drug and the need to prescribe it cautiously. The reasons for the excessive number of deaths associated with the street use of slow-release oxycodone are not clear. One possible explanation is that in recent years opioids have been made available in higher oral and transdermal presentations for the management of cancer pain. These presentations make it much easier for patients who require escalating doses to receive adequate analgesia, but they are quite capable of causing death in an opioid-naïve patient. If an abuser crushes the slow-release pill and proceeds to snort it, inject it, or take it by mouth, the problem is compounded because of the very fast delivery of the opioid dose. This is highly likely to result in serious toxicity or death in the naïve person. It also is not clear why slow-release oxycodone is associated with more deaths than highly concentrated preparations of slow-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl. It may be related to the wider availability of this agent, or perhaps to the belief among street users of a stronger euphoriant effect compared with other opioids. There is still a widespread belief among street users about the stronger euphoriant properties of heroin as compared with morphine, although randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate significant differences. Similarly, randomized controlled trials conducted by our group and others have failed to demonstrate significant differences in either analgesia or side effects with slow-release oxycodone as compared with other opioids such as slow-release morphine. In recent years it has been clearly established that the majority of cancer patients will need at least one opioid rotation due to either side effects or incomplete analgesia. Therefore, the availability of different opioid formulations of very similar properties is necessary for optimal management of pain. It is important that highly concentrated opioid formulations be available for the management of cancer pain. One way to minimize the risk of severe toxicity or death related to the use of opioids by acquaintances of cancer patients is help patients and families understand that, while these agents are safe and effective for the patient because of the development of tolerance, they are potentially lethal to naïve friends or relatives who may ingest the agents. It will also be important to educate street users about the potential lethal effects associated with crushing and snorting or injecting these pills. The extremely high level of attention to this issue by the media is of great interest. Various media approached me for interviews four times within a period of approximately two weeks. The subject has also captured the attention of government officials and medical organizations such as the American Medical Association. In Canada, similar, or even more, attention has been given to the debate about legalization of heroin, and more recently marijuana, for terminally ill patients. It is important to ensure that the needs of cancer patients and their families in having access to different opioids and other effective drugs be protected. Unfortunately, however, despite the enormous publicity about these issues, there will be very little impact on the overall quality of life of advanced cancer patients and their families. The media, government, medical organizations, and the general public have only limited time to allocate to specific issues. The debate about specific drugs or issues such as euthanasia distracts from the public's understanding and ability to address the main problem for these patients—which is that the great majority of American patients with advanced cancer will unfortunately die without access to palliative care or adequate assessment and management of their physical and psychosocial suffering. There are significant barriers to increased access, including lack of trained physicians, lack of opportunities to train in palliative care, and serious financial and reimbursement issues. These problems are complex and do not lend themselves to sound-bite, simplistic coverage, no matter how well-meaning, by the media, public relations pronouncements by medical organizations, or piecemeal, one-issue legislation. We should not let this latest debate distract us from the larger issue of improving the day-to-day care of cancer patients.",

Terbukti dengan bertambahnya jumlah penyalahguna dan pecanu narkoba secara signifikan, sering meningkatnya pengungkapan kasus tindak kejahatan yang semakin beragam pola nya dan semakin masif pula jaringan sindikatnya. Masyarakat indonesia, bahkan masyarakat dunia, pada umum nya saat ini sedang di hadapkan pada keadaan yang sangat mengkhawatirkan akibat maraknya pemakaian macam-macam jenis narkoba secara ilegal. Kekhawatiran ini semakin di pertajam akibat marak nya peredaran gelap narkotika yang telah merebak di segala lapisan masyarakat, termasuk di kalangan generasi muda. Hal ini akan sangat berpengaruh terhadap kehidupan bangsa dan negara pada masa mendatang. Perilaku sebagian remaja yang secara nyata telah jauh mengabaikan nilai-nilai kaidah dan norma serta hukum yang berlaku di tengah kehidupan masyarakat menjadi salah satu penyebab maraknya penggunaan narkoba di kalangan generasi muda. Dalam kehidupan sehari-hari di tengah-tengah masih banyak di jumpai remaja yang masih melakukan penyalah gunaan narkoba.",

      "abstract": "Waterpipe smoking is a centuries-old method of inhaling tobacco after it has passed through a body of water. Cultural variations exist in its use; however, the West in particular has witnessed a surge in flavoured waterpipe tobacco use, known as moassel. This is typically shared among peers for 30-45 min, and is now the second most popular form of tobacco consumption after cigarettes in 20 out of 30 European countries. Contrary to the common belief that it is a safer method of tobacco intake than cigarettes, waterpipe tobacco smoke composition is known to contain significant quantities of harmful toxicants akin to cigarette smoke composition. Studies on the long-term health effects of waterpipe tobacco smoking, although of low quality in these early research stages, suggest significant morbidity and mortality is associated with its use. Cessation outcomes are promising although more work is needed to develop and test waterpipe-specific interventions. The waterpipe industry remains largely unregulated and threatens to undermine existing tobacco control policies. Government, policy makers and public health agents should consider waterpipe tobacco smoking as a growing public health concern that warrants attention, particularly in regions of high prevalence.",

For instance, if I don't maintain a healthy diet, take a break from exercise, face a difficult emotional situation, or lack good sleep, my work satisfaction and productivity take a nosedive. During the height of the coronavirus pandemic, I found myself exercising less, eating poorly, and having disruptive sleep patterns. This lifestyle took a toll on me and led me into such a state of frustration and lack of motivation that my doctor suggested I see a psychotherapist for potential depression. At that time, I was about to relocate, so therapy was put on hold. However, after moving to another country, I realized I needed a change. I delved into health-related literature, tried various approaches, and tweaked my routines in numerous ways. When I started properly caring for my sleep, physical activity, nutrition, and mental health, the benefits were soon apparent. I regained my motivation and energy, and within six months, I was feeling even better than before the pandemic. This experience taught me the fundamental importance of health and well-being, and I have maintained these practices ever since.",

      "abstract": "Het recreatieve gebruik van lachgas heeft de laatste jaren een grote vlucht genomen. Hoewel incidenteel lachgasgebruik nauwelijks gezondheidsschade geeft, kan langdurig of excessief lachgasgebruik tot neurologische schade leiden. Het viel Amsterdamse zorgcentra en behandelaren op dat met name jonge Marokkaanse en Turkse Nederlanders in stadsdeel Amsterdam Nieuw-West zich meldden met neurologische symptomen, waaronder ernstige verlammingsverschijnselen na problematisch lachgasgebruik. Middels interviews met dertien jonge Marokkaans-Nederlandse gebruikers (19-28 jaar) worden de determinanten van hun problematisch lachgasgebruik belicht, inclusief de relatief lage medisch-psychische zorgvraag bij deze groep gebruikers. Van hen waren zeven jongeren (poly-)klinisch in behandeling voor hun problematische gebruik. De overige zes jongeren waren niet in behandeling, maar gebruikten wel ten minste elke week lachgas. Uit de interviews blijkt dat lachgas wordt gebruikt uit verveling en om psychosociale stress en negatieve gedachten te onderdrukken. Lachgas lijkt een panacee dat verlichting biedt. Andere motieven zijn depressie, discriminatie en conflicten met vrienden of ouders. Door de (taboe)cultuur rond middelengebruik, het wantrouwen, schaamte en machocultuur bij deze groep gebruikers bereikt de hulpverlening pas laat de Marokkaans-Nederlandse problematische lachgasgebruiker. De conclusie is dat het aanbeveling verdient om influencers in te zetten bij campagnes, gericht op de risico’s en behandeling van fors lachgasgebruik. Ook het ‘jongerenwerk’ kan een belangrijke rol spelen in het motiveren van sociaal geisoleerde gebruikers om medisch-psychische hulp te zoeken.",

These stereotypes are most commonly rooted in historical racism, attitudes to poverty and the fear that these issues bring when associated with inaccurate and sensationalist reporting by the media. Crack cocaine is a different drug when compared to opiates and services need to acknowledge that national policies and practice have predominately reflected the needs of opiate users leading to imbalances in provision within generic treatment providers. The 'high' experienced by a person taking crack or cocaine is produced by a chemical called dopamine. The combination of increased adrenaline levels and low dopamine levels after a period of using can produce the feelings of being 'wired' or 'prang'. Crack cocaine use can be associated with high levels of health complaints, drug related deaths and also an increase in criminal involvement.",

Patients themselves frequently reported a deliberale use of alcohol to decrease manic symptoms and a tendency to shun alcohol during the depressive phase. Alcohol did not seem to alter the presenting symptoms of hospitalized manic patients, since irritability and the loss of impulse control were similar among the drinkers and nondrinkers.",

This new policy statement urges pediatricians to attempt to identify and help these athletes and provides information about how to support sound nutritional behavior. Athletes may engage in unhealthy weight-control practices, particularly in sports in which thinness or \"making weight\" is judged important to success, such as body building, cheerleading, dancing (especially ballet), distance running, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, horse racing, rowing, swimming, weight-class football, and wrestling.1-3 Some athletes may use extreme weight-loss practices that include overexercising; prolonged fasting; vomiting; using laxatives, diuretics, diet pills, other licit or illicit drugs, and/or nicotine; and use of rubber suits, steam baths, and/or saunas. The majority of these disordered eating behaviors do not meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed, criteria4 for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. In two surveys of 208 female collegiate athletes, 32% and 62% practiced at least one of the following unhealthy weight-control behaviors: self-induced vomiting, binge eating more than twice weekly, and using laxatives, diet pills, and/or diuretics.5,6 Of 713 high school wrestlers in Wisconsin, 257 (36%) demonstrated two or more behaviors related to bulimia nervosa.7 In a survey of 171 collegiate Indiana wrestlers concerning their behaviors in high school, 82% had fasted for more than 24 hours, 16% had used diuretics, and 9.4% had induced vomiting at least once a week.8 Many athletes are secretive about these potentially harmful practices. Disordered eating may have a negative short-term impact on athletic performance. Athletes who lose weight rapidly by dehydration are probably impairing their athletic performance, especially if it involves strength or endurance,9 and these strength deficits may persist even after rehydration.10",

      "title": "Emerging Trend of Waterpipe use in Saudi Arabia.",
      "abstract": "Annually the tobacco epidemic kills more than 5 million people globally, one person die prematurely every six seconds in the world. In Kingdom of Saudi Arabia about 30,000 people die every year because of smoking associated diseases. (1)\r\n\r\nThe waterpipe (WP) is known in different cultures with different names as Shisha, Hubble-bubble, Hookhah, Goza and Nargghile etc. It is centuries old tobacco use method which is witnessing a worldwide surge in popularity. Water pipe is widely used in Middle East, Northern Africa and in some parts of Asia and it is gaining popularity in some Western countries. In some Arab countries less stigma is associated with water pipe than cigarette smoking.(2)\r\n\r\nMany factors have contributed to recent waterpipe wide spread use, including sweetened and flavored waterpipe tobacco, its reduced harm perception, the thriving cafe culture & restaurants. The passage of smoke through water is one of the reasons for common misperception that waterpipe use is less harmful than cigarettes. Actually health effects are influenced by type of tobacco, frequency and duration of use, volume of smoke inhaled and other factors. (3)\r\n\r\nWater pipe smoking is gaining popularity particularly in Gulf region. Its smoke contain harmful constituents which linked to variety of life threatening conditions including pulmonary diseases, coronary heart diseases, cancers and pregnancy related complications.(4) Approximately three quarters of female university students in Egypt prefer smoking tobacco via a water pipe than smoking cigarettes because they believe it is less harmful. Water pipe users are at greater risk as they are exposed to greater overall amounts of nicotine, carbon monoxide and other toxins.(5)\r\n\r\nWaterpipe smoking has adverse effects on general health and predispose to oral cancers. A positive correlation between lip and buccal cancers and WP smoking is proved. (6)\r\n\r\nA study was carried out among 1,652 secondary students aged 15–19 years of both genders in Al Hass region of Saudi Arabia. Water pipe was used by 53.9%. Of the regular water pipe smokers 20.7% smoked on daily basis and 23.8% on weekly basis. Primary motive of WP use were outing with friends, for company and to avoid boredom. (7)\r\n\r\nA similar study conducted among selected schools students (13 to 15 years age) of Al Kharaj region of Saudi Arabia indicates 20 percent students were current smokers and 16% were ex smokers; influence of friends and smoking in family were important factors among current smokers.(8)\r\n\r\nAnalysis of nicotine content of 13 commercial brands of waterpipe tobacco was carried out using gas chromatography at toxicology Laboratory; University of Jordan revealed that W P smokers are not at lesser risk than cigarettes smokers in relation to nicotine dependence. The inability of water to trap significant amount chemical substances present in tobacco (especially nicotine), and danger of combustion of additives like; glycerine, honey, and other flavors could be important factors to extrapolate the damage resulting from waterpipe smoking. (9)\r\n\r\nA study revealed that the prevalence of WP smoking in school students in the Kingdom ranged between 12 to 30 percent, which generally rose up to 37% in university students. High proportion of water pipe smokers among students might possibly reflect high socioeconomic status as highly educated parents might consider W P smoking a modern standard of living. WP use is increasing among women of different age groups also, including 14 percent of school girls, 11 percent of female university students and 16 % of female doctors. Other community groups as military personnel 30.5 percent and 15 percent of rural and desert inhabitants. (10)\r\n\r\nSocial acceptability, poor knowledge of water pipe related health hazards and certain socio demographic characters are favoring the increasing current trend of water pipe use in Saudi Arabia. There is an urgent need to promote multi-disciplinary health education activities at different age groups in order to prevent adolescent and younger age from all type of smoking especially current trend of W P smoking, and to help smokers to quit.\r\n\r\nPrevention and cessation of WP includes discouraging adolescents and adults who have never smoked, expanding legislation on water pipe cafe and banning on pro-tobacco advertising and sponsorship, besides all indoor workplaces should be no smoking area. Raising community’s awareness, firm legislation, and high taxation on tobacco products may prove effective. Studies indicate nicotine patches, gums, and nasal sprays containing small doses of nicotine, hypnosis, acupuncture and providing medical support for those wishing to quit are effective measures. Public interventions including laws and regulations smoking cafe and restaurant should be rigorously implemented. (11)",

      "abstract": "Hypnotics are taken by a fifth of adults at home, and by half those in hospital for more than 17 days. Such prescription may be inappropriate in the elderly since their insomnia frequently results from conditions such as depression, boredom and loneliness. Furthermore the elderly are more susceptible to adverse drug reactions due to decreased efficiency in eliminating drugs from the body and increased target organ response. They are also less able to compensate for unwanted effects, which may last up to 36 hours after a single dose. Despite this, there appears little attempt to reduce dosage in old patients or to select hypnotics less likely to produce side effects. We would suggest that these drugs should be prescribed with caution in the elderly, and only after a full history and examination of the patient. The drug, dosage and length of treatment should then be selected individually.",

In the present study a sample of 38 heroin users, half smokers and half injectors, was investigated using several drugs career indices. Results showed that users display preferences, with the use of some drugs being favoured over time. Injectors used all drugs more frequently than smokers. Although there was much variability in frequency of use the trend over the initial 3 years of use showed no increase in heroin use for either smokers or injectors. Although the majority of smokers had injected heroin there was no evidence that this group favoured injecting over time; rather the data suggested that smoking became the increasingly preferred method of consumption. Smokers were more likely than injectors to use other drugs post-heroin. Contrary to expectation, few periods of abstinence were reported by the subjects in either group.",

      "abstract": "Many patients with complicated grief suffer severe symptoms for several years after the loss, interfering with daily life. We sought to determine which elements of a patient's daily routine were likely to be missed or added. Sixty-four patients completed a diary each evening for 2 weeks. The diary asked whether each of 13 daily life activities were done or missed on that day. Comparisons were made with 64 matched healthy control participants. Patients were significantly more likely than controls to miss contact with another person, breakfast, lunch, dinner, starting work, and going outside, and to add a nap and evening snack.",

As a result, the disposition to experience these desires is very persistent over the long-term, manifesting itself in particular episodes of wanting to use drugs that recur with great frequency. Both the persistence and the recurrence of these desires, it is argued, contribute to a diminished ability to respond to relevant reasons that speak against drug use.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is an over-the-counter psychostimulant that, when used in appropriate amounts, is generally considered safe. However, excessive use can cause various symptoms and, in severe cases, can even be life-threatening. A 34-year-old man with a reported history of psychiatric disorders was found unresponsive at his girlfriend's house and transported to an emergency department. He was presumed to have taken several caffeine pills and was pronounced dead approximately six hours later. There was no evidence of trauma or natural diseases at autopsy. Toxicology testing on hospital blood samples revealed toxic levels of caffeine and methamphetamine. After investigation of the circumstances surrounding the death and accounting for the autopsy and toxicology findings, the cause and manner of death were certified as combined caffeine and methamphetamine toxicity and accident, respectively. Lethal levels of caffeine have been reported when blood concentration exceeds 80 mg/L. Caution is needed to avoid excessive caffeine intake, especially when consumed in concentrated forms like tablets or powders. Caffeine should be used with care not only in cases of cardiovascular disease or genetic vulnerability but also for those with psychiatric disorders. Although deaths from caffeine are rare, they are consistently reported, necessitating attention and caution in its use.",

      "abstract": "Summary It has been argued that the phenomenon of alcoholics experiencing mood deterioration during a heavy drinking bout discredits the Tension Reduction Hypothesis of alcohol consumption [6]. An experiment is described which sought to illustrate two ways in which this phenomenon and the hypothesis are compatible. Nine male alcoholics consumed 6gm of alcohol per kg bodyweight in 16 equal doses over two days. Ratings of mood and related physiological indices were used. In the long‐term the physiological measures were elevated on the second drinking day and yet individual doses of alcohol lowered these throughout. Severely alcohol dependent subjects showed corresponding effects for subjective ratings ie long‐term mood deterioration with short‐term improvement. All subjects expected continuing to drink to be reinforcing relative to stopping. Thus alcohol may retain tension‐reducing properties, and alcoholics may expect these, even if affective state was worsened overall during a drinking bout.",

      "title": "Reducing polypharmacy in the elderly",
      "abstract": "Why is it so hard to stop medications? Pharmacists see it all the time—elderly patients taking 15, 20, sometimes 25 medications. Pill burden can be as high as 60 doses per day. Patients are unsure of the reasons for medications, take them haphazardly and often have other medications added to treat side effects. They tell us they hate taking these drugs. Family doctors express frustration, sometimes inheriting an elderly patient with little medication history and struggling to keep up with changes made during multiple hospital admissions or specialist visits. They feel pressured by various clinical guidelines to start medications, aren’t sure what a patient is actually taking, may have difficulty distinguishing symptoms from side effects, but don’t have a ready-made solution to the problem.1\r\n\r\nPolypharmacy is variously defined as high numbers of medications (e.g., more than 5-10), use of more drugs than clinically indicated or use of inappropriate medications. In 2009, 63% of Canadian seniors were taking more than 5 medications, and 30% of those older than 85 years were taking more than 10. The prevalence is even higher for those living in long-term care.2\r\n\r\nThe impact of polypharmacy on our elderly population is significant. It is associated with poor adherence, drug-drug interactions, medication errors and adverse drug reactions—including falls, hip fractures, confusion and delirium—accounting for a significant percentage of potentially preventable emergency room visits and hospitalization.3,4\r\n\r\nBut interventions to reduce medication use are not consistently used. There are consensus-developed screening criteria for inappropriate medications, as well as algorithms and acronyms to help health care professionals conduct medication reviews to identify drug-related problems.5 However, there is little guidance with regard to how to implement suggested changes to reduce medication use. Many prescribers are reluctant to make such changes, often fearing adverse drug withdrawal events,6 and say they do not want to “rock the boat.”\r\n\r\nIn the Geriatric Day Hospital of Bruyere Continuing Care, our elderly patients often have multiple issues such as cognitive impairment, falls, pain and deconditioning. They attend twice weekly for functional assessment and rehabilitation with an interprofessional team. Patients referred for medication review are typically taking 15 medications per day and have an average of 9 drug-related problems.7 We see prescribing cascades (in which a medication has been started to treat a side effect of another medication) and adverse effects of drugs on multiple systems, including hypotension, impaired cognition and balance problems. One by one, over a 10- to 12-week admission, we taper and stop those medications for which we have little evidence for continued use and those that might be contributing to adverse effects. We focus on reducing pill burden, facilitating independent medication management, furthering knowledge and understanding of medication use and communicating changes clearly. The outcome can be amazing. We’ve seen patients demonstrate significant improvement in symptoms with reduction in medication.\r\n\r\nFrustrated with the never-ending supply of patients suffering with polypharmacy, and the lack of broadly implemented clinical guidance to reduce polypharmacy, we have developed a series of case reports about polypharmacy in the elderly that demonstrate the strategies we employ to reduce medication use in our patients. Identifying drug-related problems, prioritizing them, using tapering approaches, monitoring for adverse drug-withdrawal events, reducing pill burden and appropriately using compliance strategies are demonstrated throughout these cases. As an interprofessional team, each member plays a role in helping to reduce medication use and monitor the effects. We have therefore designed the case reports so they can be used for interprofessional education in geriatric pharmacotherapy. The series is planned for the Canadian Pharmacists Journal, Canadian Family Physician and the Canadian Medical Association Journal. Each case will link to online resources to facilitate interprofessional discussion.\r\n\r\nWe hope pharmacists and other health care professionals will find the strategies in this series supportive of their own efforts to reduce polypharmacy. With recent regulatory and remuneration changes, pharmacists are even better placed to actively participate in optimizing therapy in the elderly.8 We hope those who develop clinical guidelines will take note and consider how they might include “deprescribing” guidelines to further support tapering and stopping of medications when evidence is limited or when pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters affecting medication distribution and effectiveness change with age.8\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank the Bruyere Academic Medical Organization for its support, our colleagues in the Geriatric Day Hospital of Bruyere Continuing Care for their collaboration and our patients who willingly work with us to taper their medications, particularly the many patients who enthusiastically agreed to share their stories. We hope you enjoy the series and welcome your comments and feedback. ■",

The aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of the alcohol hangover. The impairing effects on memory functioning such as delayed recall, irritation, lack of concentration and after acute alcohol intoxication. Normally the body might use cytokines to trigger a fever of inflammatory response to battle infection leading to unpleasant effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue and hormonal imbalance in the body. Dehydration is believed to be the cause of hangover as it leads to anti diuresis state in the body. The most compelling theory that, at the moment, is that hangover results from a buildup of acetaldehyde, a toxic compound in the body. The congener amount in the particular alcoholic beverage is believed to be increase the extent of severity of hangover. Methanol, found in highest levels in whiskey and red wine has received a larger amount of blame for showing that it can linger in the body after all alcohol has been eliminated, perhaps accounting for the enduring effects of hangover.",

      "title": "Smoking and health: pathogenic and preventive considerations.",
      "abstract": "The most effective way to reduce the health hazards associated with smoking is to prevent children from taking up the habit and to develop better programs to help smokers quit; however given the large number of smokers it is also necessary to determine the relationship between specific tobacco smoke components and the development of various diseases so that manufacturers can develop less harmful cigarettes. In reference to smoking prevention among children educational programs necessitating the active participation of students are more effective than passive programs. In passive programs the student is simply lectured on the effects of smoking but in active programs they are required to record over a period of time their health habits in conjunction with the results of cholesterol blood pressure and physical fitness tests. Smoking cessation clinics offering long term assistance to their clients have higher success rates for one year than clinics providing only short term help. Efforts to clarify the relationship between specific tobacco components and the development of diseases need to be intensified. In reference to cancer a number of animal carcinogens have been found in tobacco smoke. Although a causal relationship between these substances and the development of specific cancers in man has not been proved it is advisable to reduce the amount of these substances in cigarettes. In regard to cardiovascular disease nicotine has been shown to indirectly affect ventricular fibrillation but the role of carbon monoxide in the development of arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease is still in dispute. The relationship between specific components and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has not been determined. The use of filtered cigarettes has reduced the risk of larynx and lung cancer but its role in the development of other diseases has not yet been determined. Graphs include 1) % of teenage smokers by year and by sex; 2) test results comparing smoking habits of an experimental group in an active smoking program with a control group; 3) % distribution of nonsmokers ex-smokers and smokers by sex and education; 4) cigarette sales information for low tar types; and 5) % distribution of lung and larynx cancer cases for filtered and nonfiltered cigarette smokers by sex and amount smoked.

      "title": "Cotinine: Beyond that Expected, More than a Biomarker of Tobacco Consumption",
      "abstract": "A greater incidence of tobacco consumption occurs among individuals with psychiatric conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia, compared with the general population. Even when still controversial, it has been postulated that smoking is a form of self-medication that reduces psychiatric symptoms among individuals with these disorders. To better understand the component(s) of tobacco-inducing smoking behavior, greater attention has been directed toward nicotine. However, in recent years, new evidence has shown that cotinine, the main metabolite of nicotine, exhibits beneficial effects over psychiatric symptoms and may therefore promote smoking within this population. Some of the behavioral effects of cotinine compared to nicotine are discussed here. Cotinine, which accumulates in the body as a result of tobacco exposure, crosses the blood-brain barrier and has different pharmacological properties compared with nicotine. Cotinine has a longer plasma half-life than nicotine and showed no addictive or cardiovascular effects in humans. In addition, at the preclinical level, cotinine facilitated the extinction of fear memory and anxiety after fear conditioning, improved working memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in a monkey model of schizophrenia. Altogether, the new evidence suggests that the pharmacological and behavioral effects of cotinine may play a key role in promoting tobacco smoking in individuals that suffer from psychiatric conditions and represents a new potential therapeutic agent against psychiatric conditions such as AD and PTSD.",

      "title": "Urinary symptoms in diabetes",
      "abstract": "Physicians have been studying urine for thousands of years. We still look at it but thankfully no longer have to taste it! Urinary symptoms may include changes in urine colour, clarity or frothiness; in volume (polyuria, anuria); frequency of urination; ease or otherwise of passing urine (for example retention); control of urination (for example incontinence); and sensations such as dysuria or awareness (or lack of it) of the need to urinate. All these aspects are relevant in diabetes. ‘My symptom started about 5 weeks ago… Constant thirst and needing to go to bathroom every hour. I am 60 and thought this was just another of the wonderful joys of aging. But as time went on I realized that my urine was smelling very sweet.’1 ‘I have high blood glucose… I'm urinating loads especially at night. I have terrible urge incontinence, I leak quite a bit… I'm only 40 so quite embarrassing.’2 Dry mouth, sweet or funny taste, thirst, need to urinate, not feeling right, and weakness are regarded as osmotic hyperglycaemic symptoms.3 Polyuria is the passage of large volumes of urine, usually at frequent intervals. It has been suggested that both the high volumes of urine and the high urine glucose content may cause long-term damage.4 Hyperglycaemia may not be the only reason for polyuria in people with diabetes. People with Wolfram's syndrome can have both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus,5 as can others without this syndrome.6 Hypercalcaemia and diabetes may co- exist. ‘The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in primary hyperparathyroidism is approximately 8% and that of primary hyperparathyroidism in diabetic patients is approximately 1%. Both values are about three-fold higher than the respective expected prevalences in general populations.’7 SGLT2 inhibitors induce glycosuria and hence both polyuria and increased urinary frequency. Other drugs, such as diuretics, also increase urine output. ‘So, I'm on my 4th urine infection in 4 months… I also think that this one *might* have spread to my kidneys, based on the fact that I have pain there, nausea, and my temperature is up and down.’8 Bacteriuria is more common among women with diabetes than in those without diabetes, so researchers incubated uroepithelial cells from each group with Escherichia coli. They found that ‘Type 1-fimbriated E. coli adhere more to diabetic than to control uroepithelial cells.’9 Cloudy urine, with or without symptoms, should be investigated, as should malodorous urine. Urinary infection can be present without these signs. Among people with diabetes, urinary infections may be due to, or be associated with, multi-resistant or unusual organisms including fungi. ‘Last week whilst at my diabetic clinic appointment I gave a urine sample and had my period at the time. Blood was present in my sample and doctor… asked if it was monthly period. Yesterday I get letter from clinic saying they have traced protein in my urine and want me back for second test… petrified that maybe I have start of kidney disease and am going to die before I get to 43!!!’10 Please don't send urine samples from menstruating patients for microalbumin or other protein analysis. Refer anyone aged ≥45 years with ‘unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection or visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection… using a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for bladder cancer.’11 People with diabetes may be slightly more at risk of bladder cancer than those without diabetes – a meta- analysis found an overall relative risk of 1.24, 95% CI 1.08–1.42 compared with people without diabetes.12 Various studies have suggested that pioglitazone use is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.13, 14 Other studies did not confirm a link.15 The UK's MHRA advises avoiding pioglitazone in patients with past or present bladder cancer, and in people at higher risk of this.16 The American FDA concludes: pioglitazone ‘may be linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer’. ‘Patients should contact their health care professionals if they experience any of the following signs or symptoms after starting pioglitazone, as these may be due to bladder cancer: blood or a red color in the urine; new or worsening urge to urinate; pain when urinating.’17 Kidney disease is very common among people with diabetes. The National Diabetes Audit found that 64.8% of people with type 1 diabetes and 79.1% of those with type 2 diabetes had some evidence of chronic kidney disease.18 Protein in the urine reduces the surface tension and, if present in large amounts, for example in nephrotic syndrome, can cause frothy or foamy urine.19 Diabetic cystopathy is a common complication of diabetes that gets little publicity. Symptoms are variable and many patients are asymptomatic or assume symptoms are just ‘because of the sugar’. Symptoms include hesitancy, poor stream, dribbling, nocturia, a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, reduced awareness of the need to urinate, leaking with increased abdominal pressure such as coughing, or more general urinary incontinence, infrequent urination, and urinary retention. Exclude other causes such as urinary tract infection or prostatic disease.20 A Japanese study found that 40% of people with diabetes without urinary symptoms had voiding problems on questioning. Cystometrograms showed high bladder volume at first desire to void and maximal capacity, with reduced detrusor contractility; and higher residual volume in people with diabetes compared with non-diabetic controls.21 In Taiwan, 22.5% of patients reported an overactive bladder on asking, among whom 48.0% had incontinence.22 Women with type 2 diabetes without other causes of urinary symptoms were more likely to have nocturia, and had weaker urinary streams, and voided smaller volumes than those without diabetes. Among women with diabetes, 13.9% had significant residual volume post voiding compared with 1.8% of controls. Reduced bladder emptying efficiency was associated with the presence of neuropathy.23 Although ‘diabetic cystopathy’ is usually understood to mean neuropathic bladder disease, the cause is likely to be multifactorial including nerve damage within the bladder and its exit, microvascular disease, and the effects of high glucose and microorganisms. Treatment depends on the problem, but reducing hyperglycaemia will reduce polyuria and reduce progression of neuropathy. Voiding every 2 hours can prevent excessive bladder volumes. Some patients with neurogenic bladder may need to learn how to exert lower abdominal pressure to help emptying. Others may need to self-catheterise or have an indwelling urethral catheter. Nowadays, most catheterised patients can use catheter valves, avoiding embarrassing, weighty leg bags, although most such patients use a night bag. NICE guidance on the management of urinary incontinence and other symptoms states that such patients should have specialist assessment.24-26 Urinary symptoms are common among people with diabetes who may not mention them unless asked. Don't assume that they are all due to hyperglycaemic polyuria. Many will not be. Any urinary symptoms are, at best, a nuisance or, at worst, a torment. Seek them. Treat them. Don't assume that all polyuria is due to glycosuria, especially in people who have near-normal glucose control. Do control hyperglycaemia as glycosuria will exacerbate urinary problems, in addition to the other hazards of hyperglycaemia. Treat urinary tract infections promptly having clarified the causative organism. Beware multi-resistant bacteria and fungi. Don't test urine for protein during menstruation but do take non-menstrual haematuria seriously. Refer via suspected cancer channels anyone aged ≥45 years with ‘unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection or visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection’.11 Remember diabetic cystopathy. ‘Evaluation of bladder function should be performed for individuals with diabetes who have recurrent urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, incontinence, or a palpable bladder. The medical history should include simple questions to unveil symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms.’27",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction is very common among people. Thousands of people are now suffering from cocaine addiction. Nicotine addiction may be one of the most common in the world, but many people underestimate the health hazards of nicotine. This report, presents nicotine in four parts: harms and addiction; research; conclusions, and further implications. Because nicotine is not like most banned drugs on the market-nicotine cannot be absorbed directly, people must be exposed to nicotine through a certain medium. The most common and intuitive way is through smoking, secondhand smoke, and e-cigarettes. However, most people don’t start smoking because of nicotine addiction, so the authors of this paper conducted experiments on why people start smoking late. Through self-made questionnaires and online experimental surveys, the results showed people were exposed to smoking because of environmental factors, social factors, psychological factors, and so on. People were exposed to nicotine for too long due to their addiction to cigarettes, which evolved into an addiction to nicotine. In the later stage, due to the addictive nature of nicotine, people no longer smoke because of the original addiction to smoking, but because they want to meet the needs of nicotine.",

      "abstract": "Le tabac est particulierement nuisible pour la sante. Malgre la connaissance generale des risques lies a la consommation de tabac et l'envie de la majorite des fumeurs d'arreter de fumer, pres de 20% de notre population selon les dernieres enquetes restent fumeurs. Il est en effet difficile d'arreter de fumer car le tabac est une drogue responsable d'une dependance psychologique et, selon la quantite fumee, d'une dependance physique. La prise en charge globale du tabagisme devra donc stimuler et entretenir la motivation a l'arret, assurer un accompagnement psychologique pendant et apres la periode de sevrage et traiter la dependance physique. La motivation, variable en fonction du stade de maturation du fumeur, est essentielle lors de l'arret du tabac. Stimuler et entretenir la motivation necessite resonance, empathie et ecoute active lors d'entretiens motivationnels par exemple. La dependance psychologique est liee au plaisir de fumer, a la gestion du stress ou de l'appetit en fumant, a la detente, a la convivialite, au geste, a l'habitude. L'accompagnement psychologique faisant appel notamment aux therapies cognitivo-comportementales veillera des lors a aider le fumeur a gerer le stress, a vivre positivement et a s'affirmer. D'autres aides paralleles ayant un effet placebo peuvent etre utiles telles l'homeopathie, l'hypnose ou l'acupuncture. La nicotine est le principal compose de la fumee de tabac responsable de la dependance physique, par fixation sur les neurones dopaminergiques de la zone de recompense du cerveau, mimant l'action de l'acetylcholine. Cette fixation favorise la liberation de divers neuromediateurs impliques dans les phenomenes de l'humeur. Lors de l'arret, le fumeur dependant peut souffrir d'un syndrome de sevrage. Cette dependance physique peut etre evaluee sur base de questionnaire, du test de Fagerstrom ou de dosages biologiques. Jusqu'a present, le bupropion et les substituts nicotiniques voire la nortriptyline sont des medications recommandees pour leur efficacite dans l'aide a l'arret du tabac. Certains phenomenes annexes frequents lors de l'arret du tabac ne sont pas a negliger: la prise de poids et l'apparition d'une tendance depressive voire d'une depression. Le suivi dietetique et de l'humeur est important, necessitant parfois une prise en charge specifique et un traitement. Le sevrage tabagique est donc un phenomene complexe impliquant des mecanismes psychiques et physiopathologiques que nous devons connaitre afin de pouvoir aider efficacement le fumeur non seulement lors de l'arret du tabac mais aussi afin de prevenir la rechute.",

Many dependent drug users have generally poor health associated with their lifestyles, and many physical health problems are directly associated with drug use. Intravenous drug users can develop respiratory complications from granuloma formation after injecting insoluble adulterants (Glassroth et al. 1986), and the inhalation of high-temperature vapours such as those of heroin, crack, or free-base cocaine can also cause respiratory disease or damage (Hughes and Calverley 1988), especially when the drug contains contaminants (Tashkin et al. 1987). Regular cannabis smoking can lead to respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest Such symptoms are similar to those induced by cigarette smoking but can occur (independently of cigarette smoking) even after a relatively short duration of cannabis use (Taylor et al. 2000).",

      "title": "Doping in sports",
      "abstract": "Doping is the use of prohibited substances and/or methods used for performance enhancement. Doping in sports is gradually becoming sensational news in India also. India's star sprinter S Dhanalakshmi and long jumper Aishwarya Babu, Aneesh Kumar, para discus thrower, and Geeta, para powerlifter, have also failed the dope test ahead of Commonwealth Games in Birmingham recently. There are examples from the past also. Ben Johnson, in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Canadian 100 m sprinter, smashed his own world record with a time of 9.79 s, the fastest man alive. Within 24 h, a postcompetition urine sample tested positive for anabolic steroids; within 3 days, he was stripped of his gold medal. Lance Armstrong admitted that his doping, his use of erythropoietin (EPO) and testosterone, began in the mid 90's and boosted his performance throughout his seven Tour de France victories in a sport riddled with doping. This problem was less prevalent in the past or it is possible that it went unrecognized due to less surveillance or less strictness imposed by national and international agencies, i.e., World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA). According to Olivier et al..[1] the prevalence of doping in elite sports is likely to be between 14% and 39%, although this figure can differ widely in various subgroups of athletes. By definition given by WADA,[2] doping is defined as an occurrence of one or more of antidoping rule violations. Testing positive for a substance that is prohibited or in the prohibited list Using or trying to use banned substance, this includes athlete biological passport cases Hiding from doping control officer, refusing to take test, not going to doping control station, and not giving complete sample Athlete not being where they say they will be or missing the test during their 60 min time slot, not submitting, incomplete or wrong information. It is potential antidoping rule violation (ADRV) if there are 3 whereabouts failure in 12 months period Interfering with testing or doping control processes included during the prosecution of case Having banned substances or method in your possession without an therapeutic use exemption or justifiable reason Handling, transporting, selling, or attempting to sell banned substances Giving or trying to give a banned substance to an athlete Helping someone to dope or helping someone to cover up doping Working with or seeking help/services from someone who is serving a period of ineligibility Actions that frighting someone from reporting suspected doping or acts of revenge against those who have reported. The principle of strict liabilities is of athlete himself/herself. They are ultimately responsible for any banned substance that goes into their bodies. There are three types of doping described: Chemical doping: chemical substances and adopting of methods that enhance the performance of sports persons to avoid fatigue and to enable the body to reach the utmost limits Blood doping: blood doping is a form of doping in which the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream is boosted in order to enhance athletic performance Gene doping: gene doping is the use of substances or techniques to manipulate cells or genes in order to improve athletic performance. Most commonly used drug is androgenic anabolic steroids, which mimic the effects of the male hormone testosterone and are designed to increase muscle mass, help sports players train harder and for longer, and reduce recovery time. Others are human growth hormone normally produced by the pituitary gland, which speeds muscle development, reduces body fat, and strengthens muscles. Erythropoietin (EPO) increasing red blood cells can dramatically improve an athlete's aerobic capacity and delay fatigue. It also improves metabolism and muscle recovery. Stimulants are substances that elevate physiological and nervous action in the body. It is being used to increase the alertness and boost general performance, i.e., adrenaline, amphetamine, and cocaine. Diuretics or masking agents can result in rapid weight loss as your water stores are depleted. They are most commonly used by sports people needing to reach a certain weight class, for example, jockeys and boxers. WADA publishes the Single List World Wide of these prohibited substance or methods and it is revised every year. This includes: Prohibited at all times: substances and methods with a potential to enhance performance in future competitions or have masking potential Prohibited in-competition only: substances considered having a relative short-lived effect, useful during/around competition time Prohibited in particular sports: substances only useful for doping in very few sports and would negatively affect performance in all others (e.g., beta-blockers). Who does dope testing: antidoping laboratories duly accredited by WADA. The task of the antidoping laboratory is to engage in drug of abuse testing in athletes employing sophisticated analytical technologies. Intent of dope testing: The intent is to eliminate any competitive advantage that might result from ergogenic aids, protecting other athletes from injury by drug-abusing athletes, and fair competition. Two types of dope samples are taken: urine and blood. Currently, NADA.[3] have more than 100 trained dope control officers for dope sample collection, mostly located around important sports centers across India. Athlete can be selected for doping control anytime, anywhere by NADA. If these laboratory analytical findings are negative, then this goes to NADA records. If these are positive, then it is an antidoping rule violation and athlete is asked to appear before Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel. The imposition of ineligibility for prohibited substances and prohibited methods except for the specified substances is as per rule. First violation: 4 years ineligibility subjected to further reduction for 2 years Second violation: 8 years to life-time ineligibility. And last, do not forget supplements. They may contain banned/prohibited substances, may be contaminated with ban substance during manufacturing process, exclude some ingredients from their labels, and may fake claims as \"approved by WADA\" or \"safe for athletes.\" This problem is more serious in countries where the markets are not regularized. Hence it is the moral duty of all physicians who are treating athletes to ensure that no banned drug is used for treatment of ailments in this group of patients. Also all sports associations/federations including team coach and doctor/physio to educate them regularly to avoid any mistake which can be harmful for their career as sports person. If at all any such medicine is mandatory, option of therapeutic use exemption should always be used well in time. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

Sexual arousal and craving are some of the reasons the youth resort to crystal (glass). Drug abuse may cause disorders in sexual function. Case report The patient was a 41 years old man. He married in age 22 years and experienced frequent intercourses with his wife from which he gained pleasure and it was his preferable method. Her wife left ten years ago. The patient started crystal administration through insufflations since seven months ago. Simultaneous with crystal abuse, wearing women's underwear was the only medium through which the patient reached sexual orgasm. Discussion A lot of psychological symptoms related to new substances (for example glass) are new to psychiatrists treating dependency in medical clinics. Fetishism may coexist with addiction as comorbidity. Another point to be mentioned is that, symptoms of fetishism increased and decreased with more and less glass administration, indicating that symptoms of paraphilia emerge as a result of glass use. In addition, prior to glass use, the patient maintained normal sexual tendencies, had experienced sexual intercourse and did not suffer from any type of paraphilia.",

      "title": "Date-rape drugs scene in Poland.",
      "abstract": "Since the beginnings of twenty-first century in Poland increasing number of reports about the drug-facilitated sexual assaults have been observed. Many drugs have been identified as so-called \"date-rape drugs\", because of their pharmacological properties, especially inducing amnesia. These drugs are used for the purpose of \"drugging\" unsuspected victims and than raping them. In a typical scenario, the perpetrator surreptitiously adds \"date-rape drug\" to the alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person, who is subsequently sexually assaulted while under the influence of this substance. Many victims do not report the incident until several days after the event or even do not report it at all. They report the incident so late after the events because they often have problems with remember the course of incident. It causes that victim is not reliable witness for justice. Detection of \"date-rape drugs\" in biological fluids is unequivocal evidence of perpetration. Analysis of biological fluids collected from victims of rapes for presence of drugs was rare in Poland up to now. The aim of this study is to show the use of \"date-rape drugs\" in Poland. Materials for this study were from the routine casework elaborated at the Institute of Forensic Research in Kraków. APCI-LC-MS methods were applied for screening of biological fluids (blood and/or urine) for amphetamine and its 6 analogues, for 12 substances from benzodiazepine group and for quantification of the detected drugs. HPLC-DAD was used as a screening method for wide range of medicinal drugs, and NCI-GC-MS methods for determination of ketamine and tetrahydrocannabinols (delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, 9THC) and its metabolite (11-nor-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, THCCOOH). In 2000-2004, the biological fluids taken from 33 persons, both sexually assaulted or perpetrators were analysed. In 2000 and 2002 not any case of this type was registered, in 2001 only two cases were recorded. After 2003 significant increase in the number of these cases was observed. Eleven and twenty cases involving \"date-rape drugs\" were submitted to the Institute in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The most common substances detected in analysed materials were amphetamine (in concentrations ranged from 10 to 85 ng/ml) and 9THC (0.36-1.4 ng/ml). Alcohol (0.27-2.3% per hundred), MDMA (8-201 ng/ml), benzodiazepines (oxazepam, nordazepam, estazolam), propranolol and lidocaine were also found in blood and urine specimens.",

      "abstract": "Substance and drug abuse is a major health problem that exerts a heavy toll on our society in terms of economic costs and human suffering. There is an unwillingness to recognise the distinction between the concept of illicit drug use and the realities of hard-core abuse. Addictive behaviour involves a wide range of substances. It includes abuse of or dependencies on nicotine, banned or illegal drugs, psychoactive medications and alcohol. Why do people take drugs? Since antiquity, both civilized and primitive people have used a near infinite number of chemical substances for such purposes as seeking pleasure, pursuing divine insight, escapism, and increasing aggression or strength, as well as the socially acceptable purpose of preventing or treating disease. South Africa is in a drug crisis, where substance abuse is now recognised as being the biggest threat facing our youth. The use of drugs by young people is a widespread and growing problem. Adolescent substance abuse is increasing at an alarming rate, and national trends indicate that the average age when chemical experimentation occurs is decreasing. Adolescence is a period of particular vulnerability. During the transition from childhood to adulthood, the young person has no real status in our society. Young people are constantly trying to achieve an identity and find new ways to handle the stresses of growing up. In order to fully understand the impact that substance abuse has, it is important to focus on the latest trends taking place amongst our youth. Cues for drug abuse identification Although drug abuse in its different forms can produce recognisable effects, those effects can be similar to conditions not related to drug abuse at all. Generally there are signs which may suggest drug abuse, and these may include the following: 1. Sudden and dramatic changes in discipline",

What are the advantages and disadvantages? The aim of this article is to trace the health effects of new, popular alternatives to the traditional cigarette. Materials and methods: A literature search was conducted using the medical databases PubMed and Google Scholar. Articles were retrieved in English, employing the key words: “Iqos”, “Glo”, „ e-cigarette” and „ tobacco” appropriate configurations. Conclusions: Modern tobacco devices, such as IQOS and Glo, emit significantly less harmful substances than traditional cigarettes. In particular, emissions of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are significantly lower. Nevertheless, nicotine remains the main ingredient in these products, with serious health risks. Regular use of nicotine can lead to addiction, cardiovascular disease and problems with the nervous system and oral cavity. Inhaling aerosol from tobacco devices such as IQOS, Glo and disposable e-cigarettes can lead to damage to lung cells and other respiratory health problems. Despite the lower risks, the use of alternative smoking methods is still harmful to our health.",

The question raised is thus: will an adolescent experimenter be a non smoker, an experimenter for ever, a regular smoker, light or heavy? This short review shows that there are numerous factors from genetics, to familial environment not limited to tobacco issues, smoking situation at school as well as school performances of the student, and also individual psychological characteristics. The experimenter is a very good target for smoking cessation actions and should deserve particular attention from preventive medicine and, thus, from school medicine, before he becomes a regular smoker, who will be more resistant to smoking cessation programs.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco cessation represents a multifaceted approach involving patients who often don't neatly fit into classic prototypes.Researchers found that current smokers experience a more than 10-year reduction in life expectancy compared to non-smokers, and more than half make an attempt each year, but less than 10% manage to stay smoke-free for at least 6 months.Therefore, it's recommended to employ a combination of methods and strategies, ranging from questionnaires to established medications.The role of the medical staff is and remains vital in this context.Nicotine is a potent drug due to its rapid absorption and swift diffusion into the central nervous system, and quitting nicotine leads to important consequences, such as craving, drug-seeking behaviour and withdrawal symptoms.Negative affective states also emerge, characterized by symptoms like depressed mood, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.Hierarchical multiple regression models have revealed that extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness and age are among the predictors of daily cigarette consumption.The authors discuss both traditional and innovative opportunities to expedite this process, while analysing the potential to enhance the compliance of healthcare providers and patients.Smoking cessation, the process of quitting smoking, can be approached through both pharmacological (medication-based) and non-pharmacological (behavioural and supportive) methods.The choice of approach or combination of approaches depends on individual preferences and needs. RezumatRenunțarea la fumat reprezintă o abordare complexă a unui pacient care adesea nu se încadrează în prototipurile clasice.Cercetările au evidențiat că fumătorii se confruntă cu o reducere de peste 10 ani a speranței de viață în comparație cu nefumătorii și mai mult de jumătate fac o încercare de a renunța în fiecare an, dar mai puțin de 10% reușesc să rămână abstinenți cel puțin 6 luni.Prin urmare, se recomandă utilizarea unei combinații de metode și strategii, de la chestionare la medicamente deja stabilite, iar rolul personalului medical este și rămâne vital în acest context.Nicotina este un drog puternic datorită absorbției și difuzării rapide în sistemul nervos central, iar renunțarea conduce la efecte secundare importante, precum dorința arzătoare, comportamentul de căutare a drogului și simptomele de sevraj.Apar și stări afective negative, caracterizate prin simptome precum depresie, anxietate, iritabilitate și insomnie.Modelele ierarhice de regresie multiplă au dezvăluit că extraversia, nevroticismul, conștiinciozitatea și vârsta se numără printre predictorii consumului zilnic de țigări.Autorii discută oportunități vechi și noi de a accelera acest proces analizând posibilitatea de a îmbunătăți complianța furnizorilor de servicii medicale și a pacienților.Procesul de renunțare la fumat, poate fi abordat atât prin metode farmacologice, cât și prin metode comportamentale și de susținere.Alegerea abordării sau combinația de abordări depinde de preferințele și nevoile individuale.",

GTS occurs through skin exposure to dissolved nicotine from tobacco leaves. Symptoms of GTS include weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, abdominal cramps, breathing difficulty, abnormal temperature, pallor, diarrhoea, chills, fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate, and increased perspiration and salivation. The onset of the illness is three to 17 hours after exposure and the duration of illness is one to three days. Initial treatment includes cessation of work, change of clothing, showering, fluid intake, and rest. In more extreme cases, intravenous rehydration, anti-emetics, and dimenhydrinate are administered. Protective, water-resistant clothing; chemical-resistant gloves, boots, and socks; working in dry conditions; and dimenhydrinate can reduce the likelihood of contracting GTS. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> It is important to provide education to tobacco workers and employers about GTS. An international public awareness campaign about GTS timed to coincide with the tobacco harvest, along with enforced worker safety regulations, should be undertaken to protect the health of individuals working in tobacco production.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Imitation/non‐imitation by adult offspring of alcohol‐related parent behavior was examined in the context of the fall‐off effect’ and of sensible/problem alcohol use, two processes which tend to constrain drinking. Evidence indicates there is more imitation by adult offspring of abstemious parents (both abstainer and low volume) than of high volume parents. Adult offspring drink significantly less, on the average, than their high volume parents, a phenomenon here termed‘fall‐off effect’ for both men and women with respect to either their fathers or mothers. This fall‐off among social drinkers appears when the mother approaches or the father consumes at or more than a typical daily drinking level (≥1 drink per day). More sensible drinking occurs among adult offspring when (I) the parent has no drinking problem‐signs than when the parent has drinking problems (this pattern appears at all levels of offspring consumption), and (2) when parents drink at high volume and have no problems for those offspring who do not imitate parent volume. Drinking “sensibly’ appears to be associated directly with the level of parent alcohol use and offsprings’ own drinking levels (considered as imitation or non‐imitation of parents), and indirectly with offspring recall of problematic intake by parents. Drinking sensibly is a medical, education and public health issue.",

      "title": "Adolescent Ethanol Exposure: Anxiety-Like Behavioral Alterations, Ethanol Intake, and Sensitivity",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period associated with rapid age-specific physiological, neural, and hormonal changes. Behaviorally, human adolescents are characterized by age-typical increases in novelty seeking and risk taking, including the frequent initiation of alcohol and drug use. Alcohol use typically begins during early adolescence, and older adolescents often report high levels of alcohol consumption, commonly referred to as high-intensity drinking. Early-onset and heavy drinking during adolescence are associated with an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorders later in life. Yet, long-term behavioral consequences of adolescent alcohol use that might contribute to excessive drinking in adulthood are still not well understood. Recent animal research, however, using different exposure regimens and routes of ethanol administration, has made substantial progress in identifying the consequences of adolescent ethanol exposure that last into adulthood. Alterations associated with adolescent ethanol exposure include increases in anxiety-like behavior, impulsivity, risk taking, and ethanol intake, although the observed alterations differ as a function of exposure regimens and routes of ethanol administration. Rodent studies have also shown that adolescent ethanol exposure produces alterations in sensitivity to ethanol, with these alterations reminiscent of adolescent-typical ethanol responsiveness. The goal of this mini-review is to summarize the current state of animal research, focusing on the long-term consequences related to adolescent ethanol exposure, with a special emphasis on the behavioral alterations and changes to ethanol sensitivity that can foster high levels of drinking in adulthood.",

Inhalants cause a fleeting sense of well being, but users frequently are also affected psychologically and physically. Substances such as gasoline and paint thinners are highly toxic and destroy major organs. The abuse of inhalants can cause cardiac arrest, asphyxiation, and accidents. This article focuses on the clinical manifestation of inhalants, altered lab values, the specific agents used, and their effects on the various organs. Health care professionals are in a key position to identify inhalant abusers when clients are seeking treatment for medical problems caused by inhalants. If health care professionals are cognizant of the manifestations of inhalant abuse, they can save a client's life.",

For a variety of reasons, including performance improvement, self-treatment of otherwise untreated mental illness, and coping with pressures such as pressure to perform, injuries, physical discomfort, and retirement from sport, athletes may turn to drugs. Doping is a term used to describe this type of abuse. Doping has a long history, dating back to when organized sports existed. Improved drug testing detection technologies and improvements in scientific research have led to the discovery and use of compounds that may later be outlawed, resulting in \"advances\" in doping strategies. The sports persons also need to be more vigilant about the prevalent antidoping rules and regulations.",

In India, there are plenty of options for smoking and smokeless tobacco, including jarda, pan masala, gutka, bidi, and cigarettes. Every year, tobacco usage claims the lives of almost six millions individuals globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tobacco smoking caused 100 million premature deaths worldwide in the 20th century. If present tobacco use rates continue, this number is predicted to climb to 1 billion in India in the 21st century. For a variety of reasons, including peer pressure, stress, alleviation, sadness, and social media ads advocating smoking, people begin to smoke or chew tobacco. The lower socioeconomic classes like and prefer tobacco more than other drugs because it is more affordable and readily available. One tobacco addicted patient tried to quit chewing tobacco, but as withdrawal symptoms, he reported having headaches, indigestion, anorexia, anxiety and body aches. The patient was treated with powder of Punarnava (Boerhavia diffusa Linn.), Sheerisha( Albizzia lebbeck L.) and Sarpagandha (Rauwolfia serpentine L.) ghana vati for his withdrawal symptoms. These are dravya’s from Ekasara gana which helps patient to feel better by reducing their withdrawal symptoms and signs of tobacco dependence.",

Controlled experimental trials have shown that small (worthwhile) benefits can obtained from acute doses of bicarbonate taken before exercise. Gastrointestinal problems encountered by some athletes limit the widespread use of this practice, however. The transfer of positive research findings to the competitive environment has proved problematic for some individuals. More recent applications involve serial ingestion of bicarbonate over several days before competition or during high-intensity training sessions over a few weeks. A number of research questions need to be addressed to enhance applications of bicarbonate loading in the elite sport environment. This commentary examines some of research and practical issues of bicarbonate loading used to enhance both training and competitive performance.",

Smokers mostly acknowledge the harm they are doing to themselves and many report that they do not enjoy it – yet they continue to smoke. Smoking behavior is maintained primarily by the positive and negative reinforcing properties of nicotine delivered rapidly in a way that is affordable and palatable, with the negative health consequences mostly being sufficiently uncertain and distant in time not to create sufficient immediate concern to deter the behavior. Tobacco smoking increases the risk of contracting a wide range of diseases, many of which are fatal. Despite reductions in prevalence in recent years, tobacco smoking remains one of the main preventable causes of ill-health and premature death worldwide.

De hecho, casi todas las culturas disponen de una droga que acompaña sus rituales sociales, religiosos, o ambos. El ejemplo más cercano se nos presenta en la transformación del vino en la liturgia católica.El consumo de drogas viene condicionado por la interación individuo/ambiente, con toda su complicidad cultural, educativa, consumista, etc. Su prevención es, por tanto, de enorme complejidad y supone una confluencia de esfuerzos entre las diferentes estructuras sociales, que van desde procedimientos legales hasta programas educativos, campañas de consumo, marketing, reestructuración de la economía, educación sanitaria y procedimientos individuales de tratamiento y rehabilitación.Este trabajo hace especial hincapié en los procedimientos psicológicos que deberían formar parte o tomarse en consideración en los programas educativos y de rehabilitación dirigidos a la labor preventiva.ABSTRACTProbably, human drug consumption is as old as humanity. In fact, almost all cultures dispose of some drug to accompany their social and/or religious rites, the closest example we have is the transformation of wine in the Catholic Liturgy. Drugs consumption is conditioned by the individual's interaction with the environment, in all its educational, cultural and consumer complexity. So, its prevention is enormously complex and supposes a confluence of forces between different social structures, that include legal proceedings to educational programs, consumer campaigns, marketing, economy restructuration, health education and treatment and rehabilitation individual programs. This paper enphasizes the psychological steps that must be a part of those educational and rehabilitation programs directed towards a preventive labor.PALABRAS CLAVE: Psicología ambientalconsumo de drogasabuso de drogasdependenciaprevencióncontrol contigencialcomportamiento aditivoaspectos educativosaspectos psicológicosaspectos socialesKEYWORDS: Environmental psychologydrug usedrug abusedependencepreventioncontingent controladitive behavioureducation aspectspsychological aspectssocial aspects",

They might perhaps say that they would be very unhappy about their child drinking at 13 years of age, but feel quite relaxed about it by the time their child was at the end of the teens. But the way they behave to their children makes it likely that their attitudes are a great deal more complicated than that would suggest. Many parents who would be horrified if their 13-year-old went to a party where unlimited alcohol was on offer would think it quite normal to let their child have a glass of wine when the family was having a celebratory meal at home. And why not? In contrast, they would probably not feel at all relaxed if their 19-year-old son or daughter was frequently drunk, drinking to relieve feelings of depression, getting into fights while drunk, or having unprotected sex with numerous different partners while drunk. So the answer to the question about how parents feel about their children and alcohol is not straightforward. Clearly the age of the child in question is a major consideration, but so is the amount drunk and the circumstances in which drinking is taking place.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette combustion, rather than either tobacco or nicotine, is the cause of a public health disaster. Fortunately, several new technologies that vaporize nicotine or tobacco may make cigarettes obsolete. Some of these new technologies are developed and owned by the tobacco industry, which invests massively for the research and development of these products. Because of its past scientific misconduct, the tobacco industry is ostracized. In the context of a fierce ideological debate on these new products, it is crucial that regulators and the public are provided with evidence-based guidance. Should the scientific production in this field be done with or without the tobacco industry? This thorny issue is discussed in this comment.",

      "abstract": "Nonostante il fumo di sigarette sia un comportamento dannoso per la salute, la sua diffusione e ampia e coinvolge persone di tutte le eta e di tutti i livelli socio-culturali. In particolare, il consumo di sigarette si presenta in genere per la prima volta in adolescenza ed in questo stesso periodo dello sviluppo tende o ad essere abbandonato o a stabilizzarsi in un’abitudine adulta. Diventa quindi importante indagare questa fascia di eta per capire quali siano i fattori che incidono sia sulla sperimentazione che sull’eventuale stabilizzazione del consumo. La ricerca qui presentata ha i seguenti obiettivi: descrivere il coinvolgimento nel fumo di un campione di 2.273 adolescenti che frequentano diversi tipi di scuole medie superiori; analizzare, attraverso un modello causale multifattoriale, l’influenza di variabili individuali, contestuali e sociali sul consumo di sigarette; valutare il peso dei concomitanti e dei predittori psico-sociali dell’implicazione dei ragazzi e delle ragazze. I principali risultati evidenziano come il fumo di sigarette svolga, per l’adolescente che vi e implicato, delle funzioni positive che hanno un impatto ben piu forte rispetto alla consapevolezza della nocivita del comportamento. In particolare, il fumo puo essere interpretato come un modo per esprimere l’identita adulta in eta precoce, ma anche come una modalita trasgressiva di affermazione vistosa di se, come una strategia per farsi degli amici, per essere accettati in alcuni gruppi e per rafforzare l’identificazione all’interno del gruppo. Talvolta il fumo si configura come una fuga e come un modo di occupare il in assenza di altre capacita progettuali. Tra i fattori di rischio per la stabilizzazione del consumo, la consapevolezza da parte dei genitori che i figli fumano risulta essere il piu importante; anche la bassa autoefficacia scolastica, lo scarso sostegno da parte dei genitori, l’uso casuale e non pianificato del tempo libero hanno un impatto significativo.",

The long-term effects of cannabis use on the lungs are well-known. However, the acute adverse effects on the lungs are sparsely reported. There are different ways in which cannabis can be inhaled, such as smoking or through a water vaporizing method known as a \"bong.\" An improvised innovative bong device that is commonly used in Northern Australia, called a \"bucket bong,\" uses water and air pressure to assist in cannabis inhalation. In this report, we describe three patients from remote and rural Northern Australian communities presenting with near-life-threatening events (acute pneumonitis and massive pneumothorax) immediately after the use of cannabis via bucket bong.",

Medical problems of addicted pregnant women involve direct toxicological influences or abstain effects of substances misused, but are also due to consequences of their chronic use, superimposed by infection, poor nutrition and psychiatric problems. Psychoactive substances have also a negative impact on pregnancy, the fetus, and the neonate. Tobacco addiction may accompany other dependencies and be one of useful markers of them. Smoking cigarettes in the substance dependent pregnant women also substantially increases the risk of both maternal and fetal complications. Special hazards are connected with labor and surgical interventions. There is a strong need to multidisciplinary approach to dependencies in pregnancy.

In the latter case, overuse destroys the user, but in the case of alcohol it destroys those around him as well. Over indulgence in alcohol is a euphemism—alcohol poisoning is more descriptive. Before one considers alcoholism one must first consider alcohol, because in all probability it has the broadest ramifications of any drug. For example, one aspect is political. The huge excise taxes collected by the government are a consideration of profound influence should a question of control come up—assuming that control is desired. Another ramification is societal—alcohol is a sort of \"pot\" or marijuana of which society heartily approves. This virtually encourages alcoholism. It is only when the alcoholic is on the skids—for drunken driving, arrests, loss of job, or splintering of the immediate family—that society invokes its",

Se realizo una revision de la literatura en Pubmed con los terminos MeSH: caffeine OR taurine OR gluconates en combinacion con el termino energy drinks con especificadores encontrando 42 articulos, se analizaron los resumenes y se incluyeron 29 articulos. Resultados. Las bebidas energizantes se componen de metilxantinas, carbihodratos, taurina, vitaminas y/o guarana. La mayoria de los efectos estimulantes son a expensas de las altas concentraciones de metilxantinas como la cafeina. Estas altas concentraciones aumentan el riesgo de intoxicacion y dependencia a la cafeina. Se han reportado casos de arritmias, infartos cardiacos, exacerbacion de sintomatologia psiquiatrica y presencia de crisis convulsivas asociadas a su consumo. Ademas, la mezcla con alcohol aumenta los danos relacionados con la intoxicacion alcoholica. Por los efectos diureticos y cardiovasculares no se recomiendan en deportistas. Conclusiones. Se evidencia que los componentes de las bebidas energizantes no son completamente inocuos. Aunque no se conocen los efectos cronicos, la literatura advierte el dano a la salud que puede producirse con la ingesta aguda fuerte o con el consumo frecuente.

E-cigarettes are often tried out before traditional cigarettes, are easily available and regarded as harmless by adolescents. Studies increasingly show negative health effects of regular e-cigarette use, including the risk of becoming a smoker of traditional cigarettes and nicotine addiction. N20 use has also become increasingly popular, and follows after cannabis and ecstasy use in prevalence rates. As with e-cigarette use, most users are not aware of potential health risks of N20 use, while particularly longer-term and heavy use may yield negative neurological and psychiatric effects.

Issues surrounding \"crack babies\" and adult children of alcoholics have been widely discussed in the popular media, and have been addressed by lawmakers, educators, and health practitioners around the country. Although scientific evidence on this topic clearly lags behind public concern, a growing body of research data documents the ways parental substance abuse can reverberate throughout the lifespan of offspring. Until recently, most scientists have focused on the issue of whether parental substance abuse affects the development of children. They have asked questions about whether prenatal exposure to a particular drug is associated with a particular developmental problem: For example, is maternal crack use related to premature birth, does maternal alcoholism cause mental retardation, is maternal heroin abuse associated with attention deficits in school-age children, or are children raised by alcoholic parents likely to have drinking problems themselves? Although studies posing questions, such as these, have often found that prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse increases the likelihood that children will have developmental problems",

This slow removal from the body makes it an attractive drug for abuse. However, cocaethylene has been associated with seizures, liver damage, and compromised functioning of the immune system. It also carries an 18- to 25-fold increase over cocaine alone in risk for immediate death.",

      "abstract": "Smokers of any age can reap substantial health benefits by quitting. In fact, no other single public health effort is likely to achieve a benefit comparable to large-scale smoking cessation. Surveys document that most smokers would like to quit, and many have made repeated efforts to do so. However, conventional smoking cessation approaches require nicotine addicted smokers to abstain from tobacco and nicotine entirely. Many smokers are unable – or at least unwilling – to achieve this goal, and so they continue smoking in the face of impending adverse health consequences. In effect, the status quo in smoking cessation presents smokers with just two unpleasant alternatives: quit or suffer the harmful effects of continuing smoking. But, there is a third choice for smokers: tobacco harm reduction. It involves the use of alternative sources of nicotine, including modern smokeless tobacco products like snus and the electronic cigarette (E-cig), or even pharmaceutical nicotine products, as a replacement for smoking. E-cigs might be the most promising product for tobacco harm reduction to date, because, besides delivering nicotine vapour without the combustion products that are responsible for nearly all of smoking's damaging effect, they also replace some of the rituals associated with smoking behaviour. Thus it is likely that smokers who switch to E-cigs will achieve large health gains. The focus of this article is on the health effects of using an E-cig, with consideration given to the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of this product as a long-term substitute for smoking.",

      "abstract": "Despite the well-known health risks associated with smokeless tobacco use, much is unresolved with respect to effective treatment for use of this substance. The present study examined the impact of a nicotine-free smokeless tobacco substitute and confectionary chewing gum on craving, withdrawal, and anxiety among 24 smokeless tobacco users following 24 hours of nicotine abstinence and a laboratory stressor. Although chewing gum did not impact withdrawal, craving, or anxiety compared to a no-product control condition, smokeless tobacco substitute administration resulted in a reduction of withdrawal and craving levels compared to the control condition following 24 hours of abstinence. Furthermore, significantly lower levels of craving and withdrawal were observed in both smokeless tobacco and smokeless tobacco substitute conditions compared to the control condition following the stressor. Results indicate that although general oral stimulation (eg, chewing gum) was not effective in reducing symptoms related to nicotine withdrawal, smokeless tobacco substitute use appears to be helpful in reducing withdrawal levels post-stressor. These data suggest that use of a smokeless tobacco substitute may be an effective aid in helping individuals wishing to quit, especially when managing stressors. (Am J Addict 2010;00:1-8).",

      "title": "PSYCHOSTIMULANT USE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "Introduction – Undergraduate students are transitioning to a learning curriculum, it's not unexpected that many of them are stressed out by academic and non-academic pressures. Many college students use psychostimulants, which are supplied legally or illegally, to cope with their pressures. College student consume coffee, which is known to contain caffeine, to remain awake for a longer period, improve their physical energy, and stay focused on their work. Furthermore, for academic purposes, students use psychostimulants. Although the number of college students who use psychostimulants without a prescription is modest, It's a form of drug addiction with potentially fatal effects. Methods – The author uses journals with a range of 2011-2021 to discuss the use of psychostimulants in college students. Results – Many college students consume caffeine, but studies show that they also use amphetamine non-medical prescription stimulants such as Adderall and methylphenidate, which are sold under the brand names Ritalin and Adderall. Discuss – Students commonly take non-medical prescription stimulants for a variety of reasons, including improving focus, being more productive with academic activities, working more efficiently, and reducing distractions. Sleep deprivation, sadness, abnormal movements, hallucinations, tachycardia, and loss of appetite are all common adverse effects of psychostimulants. Conclusion – Undergraduate students abuse psychostimulants because they can minimize their stresses and thus perform better in class. The usage of psychostimulants rises as the exam time approaches. Caffeine, a legal psychostimulant, has been found to improve alertness and concentration, allowing it to preserve cognitive performance that has deteriorated due to a lack of sleep. Keywords: psychostimulant, college student, caffeine.",

      "title": "Dietary Supplements for Improving Body Composition and Reducing Body Weight: Where Is the Evidence?",
      "abstract": "Weight-loss supplements typically fall into 1 of 4 categories depending on their hypothesized mechanism of action: products that block the absorption of fat or carbohydrate, stimulants that increase thermogenesis, products that change metabolism and improve body composition, and products that suppress appetite or give a sense of fullness. Each category is reviewed, and an overview of the current science related to their effectiveness is presented. While some weight-loss supplements produce modest effects (&lt;2 kg weight loss), many have either no or few randomized clinical trials examining their effectiveness. A number of factors confound research results associated with the efficacy of weight-loss supplements, such as small sample sizes, short intervention periods, little or no follow-up, and whether the supplement is given in combination with an energy-restricted diet or increased exercise expenditure. There is no strong research evidence indicating that a specific supplement will produce significant weight loss (&gt;2 kg), especially in the long term. Some foods or supplements such as green tea, fiber, and calcium supplements or dairy products may complement a healthy lifestyle to produce small weight losses or prevent weight gain over time. Weight-loss supplements containing metabolic stimulants (e.g., caffeine, ephedra, synephrine) are most likely to produce adverse side effects and should be avoided.",

      "abstract": "A 14-year-old Caucasian girl presented to the emergency department with a persistent headache lasting 6 h, which was not relieved by acetaminophen and ibuprofen, her fourth similar episode of the month. She worried about having already missed five days of school and wanted medication to prevent further episodes.\r\n\r\nShe denied any recent illness or drug ingestion. The patient had many friends, as well as a boyfriend, and could not think of any stress factors to explain her new condition. Approximately five weeks previously, a friend introduced her to energy drinks that she believed helped her become more focused on her school work. Additional inquiry revealed the presence of nervousness and insomnia; additionally, she mentioned that on two occasions her heart started to beat very quickly. She then asked, “Do you think that the three energy drinks I had yesterday could be related to my headache?”\r\n\r\n\r\nLEARNING POINTS\r\n\r\n‘Energy drinks’, as they have been called by the beverage industry, are commercially available nonalcoholic, carbonated and noncarbonated drinks that claim to boost energy level, alertness and performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main active ingredient in energy drinks is caffeine, present in varying amounts; however, guarana, sometimes called herbal caffeine, is considered to be a natural product and is not included in the amount of caffeine identified on the can or bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2006, more than 30% of adolescents reported using energy drinks. Caffeine metabolism slows down during puberty because of the natural surge of growth hormone, potentially increasing the risk of symptomatic effects and complications, especially in combination with other medications such as psychostimulants or amphetamines. \r\n\r\n○ Known adverse effects of caffeine are: headache, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, hallucinations, delirium and even death.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ Caffeine-associated withdrawal symptoms include: headache, tiredness, sleepiness, dysphoric mood, difficulty concentrating, decreased cognitive performance, depression, irritability, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches and stiffness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2011 CPSP survey on energy drinks revealed that: \r\n\r\n○ among 741 respondents, 9% (n=65) reported caffeine-related complications.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ according to the patients with complications, the three most frequent reasons for consuming these products were: to increase alertness (41%), peer pressure (39%) and sports performance (25%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn emerging trend in bars and dance clubs is to combine energy drinks with alcohol, which increases the risk of not realizing one’s degree of intoxication and the associated impairment of motor coordination and visual reaction time, as well as the risk of alcohol-related consequences, such as being physically hurt or injured, being taken advantage of sexually or taking advantage of another sexually, and riding with an intoxicated driver. \r\n\r\n○ In the CPSP survey, 28% of those who presented with complications associated with energy drinks had also consumed alcohol, and 26% had taken other drugs (psychostimulants 30%, cannabis 20% and amphetamines 10%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaediatricians and other health care providers: \r\n\r\n○ can play a very important role in educating children and adolescents about and in screening for energy drinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ must inform the public on the potential health hazards related to excessive intake of caffeine-containing beverages by children and adolescents.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ should advocate for continued and better regulation of products containing a high concentration of caffeine.",

A pilot or surgeon might consume an amount of alcohol that might be appropriate at a dinner party, yet dangerous before a flight or an operation. Likewise, the same applies to individuals taking certain medications, or persons with certain brain conditions or who are at an age that may cause impairment by amounts that would be benign for others. These and other complexities have contributed to the development of special training and specialty status in the field. Interested persons can contact the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Association of Psychiatrists in Alcoholism and the Addictions.

      "abstract": "Abstract The term ‘stimulant’ refers to a class of drugs that increase psychophysiological arousal. From the viewpoint of prevention, it is more useful to look primarily at the social consequences and functions of stimulants. Every society has a documented use of stimulants. When planning interventions the dynamics of use must be placed in the foreground. Stimulant epidemics, like problematic stimulant users, have a natural tendency to burn themselves out. Different types of stimulants may differ in their origins, but their epidemiological consequences and use functions tend to be similar. Implications for prevention can be drawn from the characteristics of stimulant use epidemics. Users at risk for socially unacceptable patterns should be targeted for prevention efforts. Mass media campaigns that single out stimulants should be avoided. Much of the harm associated with stimulants is a consequence of life‐styles characterized by polydrug use and unhealthy practices. Prevention should be timed to the appropriate period of the epidemic. Interventions useful at period I will not work at period 2. The recommendations of the WHO Advisory Group on the Adverse Effects of Cocaine and Coca provide a good model for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention for all forms of stimulant misuse. Stimulant prevention must be creative in finding ways of encouraging the movements of the drug to the periphery of users’lives.",

      "title": "Characteristics of older dietary supplement users: review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Published literature reports rates of dietary supplement usage by individuals aged 60 years or more to be 16−60%. Prevalence figures are dependent on the population studied and the method of data collection. In general, older supplement users are female, Caucasian and well educated, with healthier lifestyle practices than non‐supplement users, and they are less likely to be overweight or to smoke. Neither income nor self‐rated health status are reliable predictors of supplement use in this group. In many cases older supplement users report higher intakes of several micronutrients from food than older non‐supplement users. Current patterns of supplement use by the older person reveal that although they consume a range of products, they do not supplement with nutrients that are of particular benefit to them. The supplements most commonly consumed by individuals aged 60 years and over are multivitamins and minerals, vitamin C and vitamin E preparations. There is insufficient data to quantify the dosage, frequency and duration of supplement use by the older population. Obtaining this information and data about herbal medicine use is an important step towards minimising the risk of drug–nutrient–herbal interactions. Identifying the health professionals who monitor the appropriateness and safety of supplement use in older individuals, particularly given the already high use of medication in this population, also needs to be a focus of future utilisation investigations. This systematic review of the literature published between 1982 and 2003 aims to measure the patterns of dietary supplement use by community‐living individuals aged 60 years and over and to profile the characteristics of older supplement users.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol is one of the drugs most frequently used by heroin addicts prior to inception of heroin addiction. It is therefore not surprising that alcohol also represents the drug most frequently abused by persons on methadone maintenance. This abuse not only results in the appearance of all the previously known complications secondary to excessive alcohol intake, but is also a major factor in preventing successful rehabilitation while on methadone therapy. Conventional means of therapy, through abstinence and/or Antabuse, have not met with success or a good degree of patient acceptance. A multimodal approach utilizing controlled drinking, abstinence, and Antabuse along with identification of cues triggering excessive drinking may serve to attract greater numbers of persons with dependency for narcotics and alcohol into the therapeutic setting.",

Both experimental data and clinical reports suggest that medications play a major role in age-related chemosensory changes. Over 250 drugs have been reported clinically to affect the sense of taste. Taste impairments from medications include: ageusia (absence of taste), hypogeusia (diminished sensitivity of taste), and dysgeusia (distortion of normal taste). The sites of action for most pharmaceutical compounds that induce taste losses are not known, but medications can act at several levels including peripheral receptors, chemosensory neural pathways, and/or the brain. Extensive research has shown that drugs are secreted into the saliva, and salivary levels of many drugs are high enough to exert adverse effects on taste sensations either by modifying taste transduction mechanisms or by producing a taste of their own.",

      "title": "Cocaethylene: When Cocaine and Alcohol Are Taken Together",
      "abstract": "Cocaine is taken frequently together with ethanol and this combination produces a psychoactive metabolite called cocaethylene which has similar properties to the parent drug and may be more cardiotoxic. Cocaethylene has a longer half-life than cocaine, so that people who combine cocaine and ethanol may experience a longer-lasting, as well as more intense, psychoactive effect. Cocaethylene is the only known instance where a new psychoactive substance is formed entirely within the body. Although known to science for decades, cocaethylene has not been extensively studied and even its metabolic pathways are not entirely elucidated. Like its parent drug, cocaethylene blocks the reuptake of dopamine and increases post-synaptic neuronal activity; the parent drug may also block reuptake of serotonin as well. Cocaethylene has been studied in animal models in terms of its pharmacology and its potential neurological effects. Since the combination of cocaine and alcohol is commonly used, it is important for clinicians to be aware of cocaethylene, its role in prolonging or intensifying cocaine intoxication, and how it may exacerbate cocaine-induced cardiovascular disorders. Most cardiac-related risk assessment tools do not ask about cocaine use, which can prevent clinicians from making optimal therapeutic choices. Greater awareness of cocaethylene is needed for clinicians, and those who use cocaine should also be aware of the potential for polysubstance use of cocaine and ethanol to produce a potentially potent and long-lasting psychoactive metabolite.",

      "abstract": "'Energy drinks', 'energy shots' and other energy products have exploded in popularity in the past several years; however, their use is not without risk. Caffeine is the main active ingredient in energy drinks, and excessive consumption may acutely cause caffeine intoxication, resulting in tachycardia, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death. The effects of chronic high-dose caffeine intake in children and adolescents are unknown. Caffeine may raise blood pressure, disrupt adolescent sleep patterns, exacerbate psychiatric disease, cause physiologic dependence, and increase the risk of subsequent addiction. Coingestion of caffeine and ethanol has been associated with increased risk-taking behaviors, harm to adolescent users, impaired driving, and increased use of other illicit substances. The toxicity of ingredients often present in energy drinks, such as taurine, niacin, and pyridoxine, is less well defined. Recent and significant literature describing adverse events associated with energy drink use are reviewed. Although prior studies have examined the effects of caffeine in adolescents, energy drinks should be considered a novel exposure. The high doses of caffeine, often in combination with ingredients with unknown safety profiles, mandates urgent research on the safety of energy drink use in children and adolescents. Regulation of pediatric energy drink use may be a necessary step once the health effects are further characterized.",

      "title": "Nicotine dependence among workers: Is it a time for smoke-free workplaces!",
      "abstract": "The adverse effects of smoking, a chronic relapsing disease, have been recognized at least since 1604.[1] Even after understanding the risks of smoking or smokeless tobacco, and also the benefits of smoking cessation, for both general and specialized physicians, smoking cessation is not on priority. Smoking or chewing tobacco is viewed as a part of lifestyle and moreover a habit which continues despite its hazardous consequences. Almost all smokers begin smoking in very adolescence under influence of numerous social factors which include mimicking of family members and friends in circle, promotion through advertising and public images, as a status symbol in society, and some get the feel of macho man via smoking. Easy accessibility and low cost of raw tobacco products also contribute to overuse of nicotine and its products. In India, 20% of total tobacco consumption is through cigarette smoking as compared to bidi smoking which accounts for around 40% of total tobacco consumption.[2] Smokeless tobacco use in the form of gutkha is also highly prevalent in countries such as India. Stressful life, workplace stress, and nature of work also influence smoking behavior of an individual. John et al.[3] studied a community sample of Northern German area and observed that higher work strain was associated with stronger relation with Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Migration in search of job from rural areas also influences the smoking behavior. Cui et al.[4] categorically demonstrated that rural-urban migrant workers manifested a high prevalence of stress in both life and work. Both forms of stress showed association with current smoking and life stress was found to outweigh the impact of work stress. The sidestream smoke also called secondhand smoke is also harmful. Many studies till now have clearly demonstrated the association between exposure to secondhand smoke at home or at work and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which may also be a dose-dependent phenomenon. Therefore, smoking at workplaces not only harms the individual smoker but also puts his/her coworkers at risk of developing harmful hazards of smoking. A study recently done in Delhi by Prashar et al.[5] and published in this issue titled, \"Prevalence and correlates of nicotine dependence among construction site workers\" raises at least three issues, namely, (i) is tobacco chewing safer than smoking, (ii) place of FTND in smokers, (iii) will smoke-free workplace help in this regard ? The authors have found more numbers of tobacco chewers than smokers in their study. Both forms have nicotine as primary substrate responsible for addiction. Three to four times more nicotine is absorbed from chewing tobacco than smoking cigarette. It has higher risk of developing oral cancers apart from other known local effects in the oral cavity. However, the absence of sidestream smoke with this form prevents others from passive smoke exposure. The authors have correlated various risk factors associated with a relatively high prevalence of smoking and tobacco use at workplaces. They have also been able to demonstrate that majority of their study population (78%) started smoking because of peer pressure, again supporting the role of workplace stress in commencement of tobacco use. Tobacco users have varying degree of nicotine dependence. Nicotine being most important psychologically active drug in tobacco causes addiction similar to heroin and cocaine. Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ) is a simple and widely used paper and pencil test of nicotine dependence and correlates with other proposed measures of nicotine dependence (carbon monoxide, nicotine, and cotinine level). Recently revised version of FTQ, the FTND is as reliable as FTQ and has somewhat higher internal consistency.[6] The authors of the present study have used this test to assess nicotine dependence in their study population and reported 51% of them being moderate to severe dependent. Moreover, 60% of themselves found it difficult to refrain from smoking or chewing tobacco in public places; further supporting the fact that FTND may also predict the outcome with nicotine replacement as a function of dose. Worksite tobacco control initiatives face a crucial challenge. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is only one of options to quit smoking. Provisions of smoke-free workplaces are an area of debate from erstwhile and difficult to implement. However, does it work? A systematic review of smoke-free policies to reduce tobacco use by Hopkins et al.[7] has identified strong evidence of effectiveness of smoking bans and restriction in reducing environmental (secondhand) tobacco smoke, reduced tobacco use among workers with added economic benefits. Another study by Michael and Stanton compared the cost-effectiveness of NRT with state-wide smoke-free workplaces. They found that smoke-free workplace policies are about 9 times more cost effective than free NRT program and opined that it should be a public health funding policy even when the primary goal is to promote individual smoke cessation.[8] David and Lois studied the motivational characteristics of smokers at workplace and revealed that <8% of the employed smokers were ready to quit smoking.[9] Given the multiple risks of smoking and smokeless tobacco use, it is imperative that successful comprehensive programs are needed to be developed to protect and promote the health and quality life of workers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this review is to describe adolescent nutritional requirements from a scientific, nutritional, and psychosocial point of view, emphasizing the main risks of malnutrition at this age. Currently, too many teenagers are alone at home and prepare their own meals. The influence of friends replaces parental rules. The habits of adolescents are characterized by a tendency to skip meals, especially breakfast, and, less frequently, the midday meal; to purchase carry-out meals away from home; to consume snacks, especially sweets; to eat at fast food restaurants, almost always with high-calorie content; and to eat fried foods, soft drinks, and sweets. Toxic habits, such as smoking, alcohol, and drugs, interfere with a healthy diet, as well. Physical activity usually decreases during adolescence, particularly in girls. The lack of physical activity is due to a precarious knowledge of the benefits associated with practicing physical activity, low motivation, time constraints, and, in many cases, the lack of adequate facilities. Adolescents interested in a body image in accordance with modern ideals follow restrictive and unbalanced diets without any nutritional basis, which they themselves planned. These behaviors increase the risk of nutritional alterations, such as noncompliance with nutritional requirements, meal pattern irregularities, nutritional problems due to low nutrient intake, and self-esteem issues and frustration. In general, in this age group, there is an increase in protein consumption and salt content, often with a supply of unbalanced nutrients, high-fat diets (35–50% of total calories), and low polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio. In addition, adolescents consume a low level of complex carbohydrates, fiber, fruits, and vegetables.",

      "abstract": "Nalmefene modulates the motivational system by blocking the opioids receptors. Nalmefene indication is the alcohol consumption reduction in alcoho dependent patients. We describe the case of a patient with weekend alcohol abuse that was followed by cocaine use and sex. After being treated with nalmefene, the patient decreased alcohol consumption and did not engage cocaine use and sex. The patient is a 36-year-old man with a previous history of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol abuse. After detoxification the patient became a weekend drinker. Two months later he started complaining that after drinking he needed to consume cocaine and this led him to having sex with prostitutes. These behaviours had a serious impact on his finances that lead him to asking for help. Nalmefene, 18 mg at dinner before going out, was prescribed. Taking one pill of nalmefene “allowed me to drink several shots without feeling a need to continue drinking and, most importantly, I didn’t feel the need to consume cocaine and have sex”. In an attempt to ascertain if what had happened the previous weekend was “psychological” the patient went out without taking nalmefene. The pattern of alcohol use, control loss, and consumption of cocaine and sex repeated itself. During the following two months, the patient took nalmefene during dinner before going out every weekend and the results were the same as when he first took the treatment. Conclusion Nalmefene may be helpful in the treatment of several other addictions by blocking the positive reinforcements of the drugs.

      "title": "Influence of Alcohol Addicted Parents in the Development of Alcoholic Behaviour of their Children",
      "abstract": "Alcohol addiction is simply defined as a compulsive need for an intoxicating liquid that is obtained from fermented grain or fruit. These liquids include beer, wine, and other hard liquors. One misconception that many alcoholic and addicts seem to have is that their drinking is not affecting anyone else. Many times they make statements like, “I am not hurting anyone but myself”. There is a great deal of research and a vast amount of anecdotal evidence that the behavior of addicts and alcoholics can affect everyone around them, including family, friends, employers and coworkers. Addicted family members are more likely to be violent or emotionally abusive, and when abuse is not a factor; households affected by addiction can be highly disordered, unstable and unloving. If one have a drinking problem and have children in home, they are being affected, sometimes so profoundly that the effects last their entire life time. The most vulnerable effects of alcoholism or addiction are the children. The children of people with alcohol problems usually suffer greatly. Children of alcoholics have deep-seated psychological and emotional reactions to growing up with an addicted parent. Children of addicts often grow up socially isolated and they tend to develop emotional difficulties and behavioral problems. As they grow up, these type of issues can lead to antisocial behavior, mood disorders, and drug and alcohol abuse. Children of addicts often develop feeling of anger and resentment towards their parents. Therefore alcohol addiction is recognized as significant barriers of the empowerment of children, with the consequences of child's health, their health-seeking behavior and their adaptation of the family norms. Studies have shown that a child may be more likely to follow in footsteps of his parents and have the same addictive behaviors. It is vital that children have a positive and honest relationship with their parents. Those who suffer from alcohol abuse need to seek help immediately in oreder to restore and improve the family relationship. There are many supportive groups and programs available to help those families that are dealing with addiction. the first step is realizing that one drinking has become a problem, and the second step is willing to do something about the problem.",

      "abstract": "Most of the available appetite-suppressant drugs act on noradrenergic and possibly dopaminergic receptors to produce satiety. A smaller number increase excess neuronal serotonin levels by blocking serotonin reuptake or by increasing its release. All these drugs produce significantly greater weight loss than does placebo in most studies. Abuse is a problem with amphetamine, methamphetamine, and benzphetamine, whereas other drugs have minimal or no potential for abuse. Weight loss can be sustained for up to 36 months. Net weight loss, compared with placebo, ranges from 2 to 10 kg, and weight regain after terminating drug treatment proves that drugs do not work when not taken. The stigma of obesity, the public opprobrium toward obese persons, and regulatory rigidity have led to unjustified distrust in the potential of drug treatment for obesity.",

Drugs have also had an undeniable influence on art and culture. These substances become referred to as ‘drugs of abuse’ if their repeated consumption is triggered or induced by psychological or physical compulsion, often leading to conflict with society, either due to neglect of family or social duties, and also to criminal activities in order to obtain the materials. Drug abuse particularly affects young people and has become one of the most important and widely discussed issues in society. It is therefore an important task in medical science to find answers to how drugs exert their effect and what leads to addiction and permanent consumption.",

      "abstract": "Bulimia, or “ox hunger,” is characterized by episodes of binge eating, during which there is a large intake of food over a short time span, followed by induced vomiting and occasionally periods of fasting. Classically, the problem starts in a teenage female who perceives herself as being too fat. As a result, the person develops feelings of guilt and low self-esteem.‘,’ An attempt at dieting leads to some weight loss and simultaneous hunger. In the susceptible individual, this hunger results in an eating binge. To counter the effect of the weight gain from the eating binge, self-induced vomiting is initiated. Once the individual realizes that the weight gain caused by the binge can be nullified by vomiting, less restraint is exerted on the binges. A natural progression is for the person to resort to binges not only when hungry, but also when tense or anxious.3 Vomiting is usually carried out in secret, and often with the aid of the emetic ipecac. Laxatives and diuretics frequently become adjunctive agents. Although bulimics may binge and vomit as little as twice a week, the frequency varies and it can become as high as 140 episodes each week.3-6 The average intake of food is 3,400 calories in a 1.2-hour period, with some patients ingesting as much as 50,000 calories in a 24hour period.5 Casper3 characterized the three major manifestations of bulimia nervosa as recurrent episodes of binge eating with an awareness on the patient’s part that the pattern is abnormal, the presence of depressed moods, and the absence of any known physical disorder. In addition, at least three of the following are present: high-calorie intake during the binge, inconspicuous eating during the binge, self-induced vomiting at the end of the binge, repeated attempts to lose weight through dieting and",

While there is evidence to suggest a high prevalence of risky drinking among users of ATS in Australia, little is known about how they combine their use of ATS with the consumption of alcohol or why they do so. This paper considers how ATS users consume alcohol during ecstasy and methamphetamine use, and also addresses alcohol abuse and dependence among low-risk and at-risk ATS users. At-risk users are more likely to have experienced alcohol abuse and dependence during adolescence or early adulthood, suggesting that higher-risk use of ATS may be linked with problematic drinking patterns. The paper suggests that problematic behaviour relating to alcohol and ATS use is interlinked, and may be important in developing appropriate policy responses.",

      "abstract": "A drug-addicted person may set a goal to abstain from taking drugs, yet soon afterwards he or she will ignore all warnings or reprimands, take an excessive amount of a drug, and possibly go much farther, such as trade in a car, or another valuable possession, for a couple of cocaine hits. This disadvantageous decision-making and drug- seeking behavior may continue despite catastrophic personal consequences -- for example, loss of job, health, or family -- even when the drug is no longer perceived as pleasurable. A series of brain-mapping studies and neuropsychological tests conducted at BNL has shown that people addicted to cocaine have an impaired ability to process rewards and exercise control, in a way that is directly linked to changes in the responsiveness in their prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain essential for advantageously monitoring and controlling one's own behavior. Goldstein will describe her research in this field, which was designed to test a theoretical model postulating that drug-addicted individuals disproportionately attribute value to their drug of choice -- at the expense of other potentially but no-longer-rewarding stimuli and at the same time, experience decreased ability to inhibit their drug use.",

      "title": "Die Prävalenz und Ausprägung von Persönlichkeitsstörungen bei Ecstasykonsumenten",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung\r\n\r\nEcstasy ist die am haufigsten konsumierte synthetische Droge, im Jahr 2000 erreichte die Anzahl der vom BKA beschlagnahmten Tabletten erneut eine Rekordhohe. Gleichzeitig steigt die Zahl der Berichte uber medizinische Komplikationen – auch mit Todesfolge. Inzwischen mehren sich Hinweise darauf, das der dauerhafte Konsum groserer Mengen von Ecstasy neurotoxische Auswirkungen haben konnte, deren langfristige Folgen nicht absehbar sind.\r\nWelche Faktoren tragen zur Entwicklung eines Risikokonsums beziehungsweise einer Abhangigkeit bei? Bei Alkohol- und Drogenabhangigen konnte gezeigt werden, das Personlichkeitsstorungen, allen voran die antisoziale und Borderline Personlichkeitsstorung, einen starken Einflus auf die Entstehung, Aufrechterhaltung und den Verlauf der Erkrankung haben. Zum Missbrauch von Ecstasy ist die Datenlage diesbezuglich noch unzureichend.\r\n\r\nDies ist die erste Studie, die der Frage nach der Pravalenz und Auspragung von Personlichkeitsstorungen an einer groseren Stichprobe von Ecstasykonsumenten nachgegangen ist. Dazu wurden unter Verwendung zweier Selbstratinginstrumente (Personality Disorder Questionaire, PDQ-R und Inventar Klinischer Personlichkeitsakzentuierungen, IKP) 57 Ecstasykonsumenten (31 mannlich, 26 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 23 Jahre) mit 30 Konsumenten anderer illegaler Drogen (19 mannlich, 11 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 22 Jahre) sowie 7 Abstinenten (3 mannlich, 4 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 22 Jahre) verglichen. Im nachsten Schritt wurden die Ecstasykonsumenten nach dem Schweregrad des Konsums drei Gruppen zugeteilt, die ebenfalls miteinander verglichen wurden.\r\nNach den Ergebnissen der vorliegenden Studie haben Ecstasykonsumenten und insbesondere –abhangige im Vergleich zu ecstasy- sowie drogenabstinenten Kontrollen mit identischem subkulturellem Hintergrund, aber auch gegenuber der Allgemeinbevolkerung und gleichaltrigen Studenten eine erhohte Pravalenz und Auspragung von Personlichkeitsstorungen. Die Zahlen liegen etwa auf dem Niveau von Patienten eines stationaren Drogenentwohnungsprogramms. Weiterhin zeigen sich teilweise signifikante Zusammenhange zwischen der Auspragung einzelner Personlichkeitsstorungen und dem Schweregrad des Konsums von Ecstasy und anderen Drogen.\r\nEcstasykonsumenten fallen durch teilweise signifikant erhohte Werte insbesondere fur Personlichkeitsstorungen aus dem Cluster B auf, was konsistent ist mit anderen Studien, die bei Ecstasykonsumenten eine Pragnanz von Personlichkeitszugen gefunden haben, die den Cluster B Personlichkeitsstorungen zugrunde liegen. Diejenigen Ecstasykonsumenten, deren Gebrauchsmuster die ICD-10 Abhangigkeitskriterien erfullen, unterscheiden sich von den Kontrollen daruber hinaus durch eine starkere Belastung bei den Cluster C Personlichkeitsstorungen, was als Hinweis auf Probleme aus dem angstlich-dysphorischen Bereich gewertet wird. Dieses Ergebnis deckt sich mit Ergebnissen anderer Studien, die auf eine erhohte depressive Belastung von Ecstasykonsumenten hindeuten. \r\n\r\nDie Frage, inwieweit diese Ergebnisse durch vorbestehende Personlichkeitseigenschaften, mogliche neurotoxische Folgen des Ecstasykonsums, den Konsum anderer Drogen sowie durch methodische Schwierigkeiten insbesondere bei der Diagnostik von Personlichkeitsstorungen beeinflust worden sind, wird ausfuhrlich diskutiert. \r\n\r\nAls weiteres wichtiges Ergebnis dieser Studie ist die niedrige Pravalenz der antisozialen Personlichkeitsstorung zu nennen, die mit 9% in der Gesamtgruppe der Ecstasykonsumenten und 14% bei den Ecstasyabhangigen unter der Zahl liegt, die bei Alkohol-, Opiat- und Kokainabhangigen gefunden werden. Dieses Ergebnis ist wahrscheinlich auf verschiedene Faktoren wie eine grostenteils bessere soziale Integration von Ecstasykonsumenten, substanzspezifische Unterschiede sowie die mangelnde Validitat der antisozialen Personlichkeitsstorung zuruckzufuhren.\r\n\r\nZusammengefast weist diese Studie auf die wichtige Rolle von Personlichkeitsstorungen bei der Entwicklung von Misbrauch- und Abhangigkeitsmustern von Ecstasy hin. Fur die Zukunft ware es wunschenswert, diejenigen Konsumenten, bei denen Hinweise auf das Vorhandensein einer Personlichkeitsstorung vorliegen beispielsweise unter Verwendung semistrukturierter Interviews genauer zu betrachten. Daruber hinaus weist diese Studie auf die Unterschiede zu Abhangigen herkommlicher Drogen und die daraus folgende Notwendigkeit fur speziell auf Ecstasykonsumenten zugeschnittene Hilfsangebote hin.",

We probably do not think of the Olympic gold medalist, the professional baseball player who is a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame, or the National Football League lineman. Yet these athletes and hundreds, perhaps thousands of others regularly use drugs in the course of their training, performance, or both. I am talking not about recreational drug use-athletes use drugs for pleasure and relaxation probably no more or less than their contemporaries with comparable incomes-but about a much less discussed type of drug use: taking drugs to enhance performance. It is a strange idea. Most of us think of drugs in one of two ways. Either they are being properly used by doctors and patients to make sick people well or at least to stem the ravages of illness and pain, or they are being misused-we say abused-by individuals in pursuit of unworthy pleasures. Performance-enhancing drug use is so common and so tolerated in some forms that we often fail to think of it as",

The typical behavioral reaction appeared to be a reversion to immature, dependent modes of living, which, however, did not represent any real threat to the psychological health of emotionally stable subjects. It appears that fasting for long periods is not especially stressful when it results in an extreme weight loss and consequent increase in self-esteem.",

      "abstract": "Dietilenoglicol é uma substância química totalmente incolor, inodora e de sabor adocicado e é utilizada como intermediário químico nas indústrias, principalmente como solvente ou anticongelante. O dietilenoglicol foi apontado como agente responsável por intoxicações em massa desde os anos de 1930, em cerca de seis países. Quando usado erroneamente, pode resultar em efeitos adversos significativos à saúde, incluindo insuficiência renal e letalidade. As intoxicações não são comuns, porém, são notórias por ocorrerem de forma epidêmica e com alta mortalidade. Geralmente os casos acontecem pela adulteração, falsificação e substituição de substâncias não tóxicas pelo dietilenoglicol. Apesar do efeito inebriante, a substância é praticamente atóxica, sendo o grande problema a sua biotransformação, pois esta dá origem a metabólitos de elevada toxicidade, como o ácido diglicólico. O primeiro relato de intoxicação em massa conhecido ocorreu no ano de 1937 nos Estados Unidos da América (EUA). Este trágico evento gerou impacto nacional e levou o Congresso Norte-americano a aprovar a criação do Food and Drug Administration, agência federal do Departamento de Saúde e Serviços Humanos nos EUA. No presente estudo, foram descritas as diversas intoxicações que ocorreram ao longo dos últimos oitenta anos, com ênfase nos casos que ocorreram em Minas Gerais – Brasil no final do ano de 2019 e início de 2020.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Incretin-based medications for treating obesity produce substantial short- and long-term weight loss and improve obesity-related comorbidities. However, associating lifestyle modification with new medications to treat obesity is generally advisable for several reasons. Firstly, healthy eating patterns and physical activity may offer important additional benefits, enhancing the patient's health and well-being. In addition, regular specialist counselling in lifestyle modification can help patients maintain their motivation levels and develop specific skills for addressing obstacles during the lengthy process of weight loss and maintenance, potentially improving outcomes in the long term. Given the high efficacy of the new weight-loss drugs, it would be timely to streamline and simplify the current gold standard of obesity management based on lifestyle modification. For example, it now seems redundant to prescribe strict diets or meal replacements to reduce calorie intake, or to recommend patients practice 200 to 300 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise for enhanced weight loss. Moderate calorie restriction and, at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and two sessions of muscle-strengthening activities per week may be more achievable and appropriate goals for sustainable weight loss in most patients on pharmaceutical obesity treatment. As regards lifestyle modification counselling, future studies should assess its optimal intensity and duration in the \"new medications for obesity era\".

Objetivo: Describir las alteraciones respiratorias y sistémicas derivadas del consumo de cigarrillos electrónicos y que pueden servir para comprender los riesgos involucrados con su utilización tanto a corto como a largo plazo. Materiales y métodos: Se realizó una búsqueda y recolección exhaustiva de datos e información relevante sobre este tema, empleándose como criterios de inclusión artículos que describan los efectos respiratorios y sistémicos asociados con el uso de los cigarrillos electrónicos. Resultados: Los cigarrillos electrónicos son dispositivos que generan un aerosol mediante la vaporización del líquido que contienen, si bien los compuestos presentes en el vapor generado por estos dispositivos parecen ser menos dañinos que los producidos por combustión por parte del cigarrillo convencional, estudios recientes indican la ocurrencia de un grupo heterogéneo de alteraciones respiratorias y sistémicas que pueden ocurrir tras su consumo. Conclusiones: Se han descrito alteraciones en la salud producidas por el uso de los cigarrillos electrónicos, destacándose entre ellas el daño al parénquima pulmonar y de las vías respiratorias pequeñas y también a nivel extrapulmonar por la evidencia de trastornos a nivel cardiovascular, neurológico, tegumentario e inmunológico.",

      "title": "A Bridge Too Far: Individuals With Regular and Increasing Very Heavy Alcohol Consumption Cannot be Considered as Maintaining “Recovery” Due to Toxicity and Intoxication-related Risks",
      "abstract": "The concept of “recovery” from alcohol use disorders (AUD) has garnered increasing scientific interest in recent years including attempts to explicate and measure its presumed component parts. In general, there is consensus that “recovery” should not be solely about abstinence or quantity-frequency measures of alcohol consumption and should include measures of functioning. Some researchers have taken an even more radical step, however, to suggest that psychosocial functioning should be the sine qua non defining feature of “recovery,” seemingly irrespective of how much one drinks; as such, people can be classified as achieving and maintaining successful “recovery” despite engaging in regular very heavy drinking. This commentary argues against this notion, as it goes beyond existing data and largely ignores the more insidious toxicity-related, as well as acute intoxication-related, health risks, known to occur with heavy alcohol exposure that contradict the salubrious intent of the “recovery” construct. Furthermore, classifying someone as being in successful “recovery” due to high functioning but while engaging in very heavy drinking, ignores the potential collateral damage to close significant others (eg, children, partners), whose well-being can be severely impacted by the enduring unpredictability of heavy use. Finally, it is argued that exclusive championing of “functioning,” while paying little if any attention to AUD remission or alcohol exposure status, creates a conceptual conundrum whereby someone with low functioning but who is in long-term AUD remission or completely abstinent could be classified as not achieving “recovery,” holding such individuals to a higher standard and may be stigmatizing.",

      "title": "Sleep: A Nightmare",
      "abstract": "Common Causes of Sleeplessness Include: (1) Stress – Concerns about work, school, health, finances, or family can keep your mind active at night, making it difficult to sleep. Stressful life events or trauma – such as the death or illness of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss can lead to stress. (2) Travel or work schedule – Disrupting your body’s circadian rhythms can lead to lack of sleep. Causes include jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late or early shift, or frequently changing shifts. (3) Poor sleep habits – Poor sleep habits include an irregular bedtime schedule, naps, stimulating activities before bed, an uncomfortable sleep environment, and using your bed for work, eating, or watching TV. Computers, TVs, video games, smartphones, or other screens just before bed can interfere with your sleep cycle. (4) Eating too much late in the evening – Having a light snack before bedtime is OK, but eating too much may cause you to feel physically uncomfortable while lying down. Many people also experience heartburn, a backflow of acid, and food from the stomach into the esophagus after eating, which may keep you awake. (5) Mental health disorders – Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, may disrupt your sleep. Awakening too early can be a sign of depression. (6) Medications – Many prescription drugs can interfere with sleep, such as certain antidepressants and medications for asthma or blood pressure. Many over-the-counter medications – such as some pain medications, allergy, and cold medications, and weight loss products – contain caffeine and other stimulants that can disrupt sleep. (7) Medical conditions – Examples of conditions linked with insomnia include chronic pain, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), overactive thyroid, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. (8) Sleep-related disorders – Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing periodically throughout the night, interrupting your sleep. Restless legs syndrome causes unpleasant sensations in your legs and an almost irresistible desire to move them, which may prevent you from falling asleep. (9) Caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol – Coffee, tea, cola, and other caffeinated drinks are stimulants. Drinking them in the late afternoon or evening can keep you from falling asleep at night. Nicotine in tobacco products is another stimulant that can interfere with sleep. Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often causes awakening in the middle of the night. Complications of Insomnia May Include: (1) Lower performance on the job or at school. (2) Slowed reaction time while driving and a higher risk of accidents. (3) Mental health disorders, such as depression, an anxiety disorder, or substance abuse. (4) Increased risk and severity of long-term diseases or conditions, such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Prevention: Good sleep habits can help prevent insomnia and promote sound sleep: (1) Keep your bedtime and wake time consistent from day to day, including weekends. (2) Stay active – regular activity helps promote a good night’s sleep. (3) Check your medications to see if they may contribute to insomnia. (4) Avoid or limit naps. (5) Avoid or limit caffeine and alcohol, and do not use nicotine. (6) Avoid large meals and beverages before bedtime. (7) Make your bedroom comfortable for sleep and only use it for sex or sleep. (8) Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading, or listening to soft music. Conclusion: Sleep deprivation is helping no one except the market. Brands are capitalizing on our lack of sleep, on our habits. Who are we giving excuses to, our web series can be paused, late night conversation can",

      "abstract": "The older view of addiction was that people became addicted because they were ignorant of the risks of addiction, they were unhappy, or they lacked healthy opportunities. Once addicted, they were hooked by physical dependence, causing them to continue use despite wanting to quit. The new paradigm of addiction focuses on reward and the powerful experience of falling in love with the feeling that addictive behaviors produce. Potential addicts seek brain reward and are heedless of the risks, of which they are seldom ignorant. Withdrawal is largely irrelevant. The problem of addiction is the power of brain reward. The new view of addiction has important implications for prevention, treatment, public policy, and medical treatment with controlled substances.",

Energy drinks (ED) appeared on the market as a mixture of carbohydrates, vitamins, and caffeine. Later, alcohol blends were made for cocktails, so their popularity increased. The high consumption of ED is due to the mental stimulating effect by the high levels of caffeine, taurine and glucuronolactone [3].",

Soziale Ausgrenzungs- und Stigmatisierungsprozesse beeinflussen Lebens- und Drogenkonsumbedingungen massiv. Das selektive Drogenverbot hat erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die Akzeptanz, Unterstützung und soziale Teilhabe. Nach einer strafrechtlichen Auffälligkeit durch Strafverfolgungs-/Justiz- oder Strafvollzugsbehörden werden soziale Ausgrenzungsprozesse verstärkt, die wiederum Auswirkungen auf das Drogenkonsumverhalten haben. Der Prozess der Kriminalisierung der Konsumierenden illegaler psychoaktiver Substanzen hat in Deutschland ein hohes Ausmaß angenommen. Die Zahl der polizeilich festgestellten Rauschgiftdelikte steigt seit vielen Jahren kontinuierlich an und betrifft im Wesentlichen Konsumierende mit Mengen zum Eigenbedarf (ca. 75% aller 282 604 im Jahre 2015 Delikte). Nach der Verurteilung zu einer Freiheitsstrafe erleben Drogenabhängige einen doppelten Ausschluss: von Freiheit und (in den meisten Bundesländern) vom Zugang zu anerkannten Infektionsschutz- und Behandlungsprogrammen. Zu diskutieren ist eine Reduktion der Kriminalisierungslast für Konsumierende illegaler Drogen, etwa mit einer gesellschaftlich konsentierten Regulation einer bestimmten Menge zum Eigenbedarf und kontrollierter Zugangsmöglichkeiten zu psychoaktiven Substanzen unter Wahrung des Jugend- und Verbraucherschutzes.",

      "title": "Decentering alcohol: Non‐drug pleasure and reinforcement as an alternative target",
      "abstract": "Though pleasure from alcohol is oft underemphasized, we suggest that public health messaging only needs to acknowledge (rather than emphasize) the pleasures of alcohol, to broadly accept the human propensity for pleasure, and to intentionally leverage these empirical findings by emphasizing and increasing the availability of non-drug alternatives. The opinion and debate piece by Nicholls and Hunt [1] stimulates an interesting discussion on the importance of pleasure in public health-oriented research on alcohol. We agree that pleasure is an important concept in understanding alcohol use as well as other substance use, and that public health discourse limits its own efficacy by focusing primarily on harm without acknowledging many of the benefits people report experiencing from drinking (or other drug use). This idea is broadly consistent with the behavioral science literature, which posits that alcohol can function as a positive reinforcer by producing desirable effects (e.g. enhancing social connection, inducing pleasant subjective effects) that increase the likelihood of future alcohol use. These reinforcing effects may, at least during any discrete use occasion, outweigh the costs, acute or chronic, of alcohol use [2]. Although humans are motivated by costly immediate harms [3], they are less so by delayed, diffuse, and uncertain ones [4-6]. This human aversion to immediate harms is matched by an innate, evolutionarily adaptive drive for pleasure or related positive subjective states. From a population perspective, harms associated with alcohol use are characteristically delayed, diffuse and uncertain for most people who use alcohol, if they experience problems at all, and rewards are often immediate and robust. In the case of social connection, for example, alcohol may help to facilitate a basic human need of social bonding [7, 8] while only inconsistently resulting in harms that lessen this potent reward. Ignoring the reality that many find alcohol to be pleasurable goes against the experience of many who drink and threatens to delegitimize public health messaging. A similar problem can be found in many treatment settings that focus almost exclusively on reiterating harms of alcohol while failing to acknowledge that drinking once served an adaptive function, even if for most it was maladaptive by the time treatment began. Although perhaps conspicuously absent from public health messaging research, there is a rich history of experimental work describing the pleasurable effects of alcohol and other drugs [9-12]. These studies, typically conducted in the framework described by the United States Food and Drug Administration Human Abuse Potential guidelines, seek to evaluate subjective effects like 'Good Effect' or 'Drug Liking' and determine the potential for a drug's future misuse [13]. Notably, these studies highlight the role that pleasure, or more broadly positive reinforcing effects, play in determining future behavior—behaviors that evoke greater pleasure are more likely to be repeated in the future, and a drug's 'abuse potential' is at least in part related to its ability to induce pleasure. In addition to understanding the importance of the reinforcing efficacy of alcohol, modern behavioral models of addiction have emphasized the importance of alternative, non-drug reinforcement that can effectively compete with substances [14, 15]. Research across the translational spectrum has demonstrated that behavioral allocation toward substance reinforcers is dependent upon the presence or absence of other reinforcers in the choice context [16-19]. Typically, addiction treatment focuses on explicit reduction in the value of a drug through pharmacological or behavioral methods. Interventions may instead (or may also) increase the value of non-drug alternatives that serve the same functional purpose that drugs do for a given patient. This idea is highlighted in the recent sober curious movement and the proliferation of non-alcoholic beverages (e.g. mocktails). Such approaches offer a mechanism of reducing alcohol use by introducing an alternative that, at least partly, retains many of the pleasurable functions of alcohol (e.g. social connection and acceptance, taste) and effectively serves as a competing option. Public health serves a societal function and, as stated by the authors, is built on a foundational principle that long-term rewards, such as health, are better than short-term rewards. By necessity, public health typically takes a utilitarian, rather than Kantian, approach, valuing the whole over the individual, and focuses on the health of the public in addition to those pleasures that can be paired with health. However, we agree with the authors that public health risks its legitimacy by ignoring the experience of people who primarily experience the positive, rather than the negative, effects of alcohol. Perhaps a compromise: public health messaging only needs to acknowledge (rather than emphasize) the pleasures of alcohol, to broadly accept the human propensity for pleasure, and to intentionally leverage these empirical findings by emphasizing and increasing the availability of non-drug alternatives. Public health messages that can craft a compelling and competitive narrative of pleasure in other activities may be more effective than focusing exclusively on the pleasures or perils of alcohol alone.

These frequent users are more at risk of suffering the harms associated with cannabis use than infrequent users. This report is an exploratory investigation into factors which might encourage regular cannabis users to stop or reduce their consumption of cannabis. The study results indicate that, while being arrested or imprisoned may discourage cannabis use, such measures are less likely to reduce consumption among frequent cannabis users than among those who use cannabis only infrequently. Frequent cannabis users, on the other hand, are more likely than occasional cannabis users to say that they would seek treatment if one were available. The study also finds evidence that regular cannabis users would respond to a shortage of cannabis, or an increase in the cost of cannabis, by switching to other drugs such as tobacco.",

In assessing the causal relationship, I estimate fixed‐effects instrumental variable models by using exogenous variation in adopting a reduced workweek in South Korea as an instrument for work hours. The estimation results reveal that shortening work hours induces individuals to exercise regularly and decreases the likelihood of smoking, with more pronounced effects for heavy smokers. While a work‐hour reduction substantially increases the probability of drinking participation, it does not significantly affect the likelihood of frequent or daily drinking habits. In addition, the effect of a work‐hour reduction on regular exercise is salient among women and older groups, and the effect on smoking behaviors is more pronounced among men and middle‐aged groups.

It is difficult to prove the precise etiologic agent for any suspected eruption. The only way to prove definitively that a given drug has caused an eruption is to discontinue the suspected drug, wait until the reaction clears, and then readminister the drug to observe if a relapse occurs.

      "abstract": "The health effects of tobacco depend on the way it is used. When chewed or taken as snuff it causes an increased risk of cancer in, respectively, the mouth and nose. When smoked, particularly in the form of cigarettes, the smoke is inhaled, absorbed into the blood, and distributed throughout the body, and so is able to cause disease in many different organs. That it does so is not surprising, when it is borne in mind that tobacco smoke contains some 4000 chemicals, including more than 50 that can cause cancer in animal experiments.",

      "title": "Fasting – the ultimate diet?",
      "abstract": "Adult humans often undertake acute fasts for cosmetic, religious or medical reasons. For example, an estimated 14% of US adults have reported using fasting as a means to control body weight and this approach has long been advocated as an intermittent treatment for gross refractory obesity. There are unique historical data sets on extreme forms of food restriction that give insight into the consequences of starvation or semi-starvation in previously healthy, but usually non-obese subjects. These include documented medical reports on victims of hunger strike, famine and prisoners of war. Such data provide a detailed account on how the body adapts to prolonged starvation. It has previously been shown that fasting for the biblical period of 40 days and 40 nights is well within the overall physiological capabilities of a healthy adult. However, the specific effects on the human body and mind are less clearly documented, either in the short term (hours) or in the longer term (days). This review asks the following three questions, pertinent to any weight-loss therapy, (i) how effective is the regime in achieving weight loss, (ii) what impact does it have on psychology? and finally, (iii) does it work long-term?",

Therefore it is likely that some of our patients may be using illicit drugs in combination with other medications. Illicit substance use may contribute to adverse effects, interfere with treatment efficacy, or even augment treatment effects. Additionally, regular users of illicit substances may exhibit poor medication adherence or impaired ability to engage in behaviours such as blood glucose testing in diabetes.Systematic research on drug interactions with illicit drugs is not routinely conducted – most evidence comes from case reports. However, drug interactions are important. Many deaths that are attributed to illicit drug toxicity alone are often actually the result of drug interactions. This article reviews potential drug interactions with illicit drugs, with an emphasis on the two most popular illicit drugs in Australia – cannabis and methamphetamine.",

These experiences keep the suspicion of drug eruptions at a high level. Clinical and laboratory findings in drug eruptions have been described, and commonly the reporter has verified the diagnosis by subsequent administration of the suspected drug. The test dose given appears to be a calculated guess. Warnings have been issued about the dangers from attempts to prove the diagnosis.

Vietnam veterans were more likely to have begun using heroin during their military service, and they were more likely to say that their service experiences had affected their use of drugs, usually citing relief of fear and tensions of war. Veterans who had not been in Vietnam were somewhat more likely to have begun using drugs after service, and generally indicated that their military experiences had not affected their drug use. When they did cite an effect of service, the factors usually indicated were boredom and a lack of meaningful activity. Attitudes toward narcotic use were negative in both groups, but significantly less so among Vietnam veterans. However, these attitudes did not relate to patterns of current or past drug use. Groups did not differ in the extent of or reasons for current illicit drug use, but non-Vietnam veterans reported more alcohol use. The Vietnam war was mentioned by one Vietnam veteran and by no non-Vietnam veterans as a reason for continuing narcotic use. Few other differences were found. Notably, typical treatment course over a 5-year follow-up period was similar in the two study groups.",

Clinicians and researchers alike have the need to quantify drinking patterns to determine the risk for adverse, health-related events such as injury, liver damage, and cancer. Biochemical measures of ethanol consumption are affected by temporal patterns of drinking as well as individual characteristics such as gender and age. The choice of a laboratory analysis to determine ethanol consumption is complex; no single laboratory test will predict drinking accurately across all drinking patterns, across the life span, and across gender. In conjunction with interviews and physical assessment, however, biochemical laboratory tests are sensitive tools used to measure both recent and long-term patterns of alcohol consumption.",

When exercise or physical work increase to more than 1 hour per day, the importance of adequate energy and nutrient intakes becomes more critical. As the American public becomes more concerned with health and health issues, the interest in nutrition and physical activity has increased. This interest in health has also heightened the sale of supplements, herbal preparations, and weight loss products, all aimed at improving health, preventing or curing disease, improving sport performance, and changing body composition and weight. Sports nutrition’s the practical science of hydrating and fuelling before, during and after exercise. Executed properly, sports nutrition can help promote optimal training and performance. Done incorrectly or ignored, it can derail training and hamper performance. Active individuals need more energy (calories) each day than their sedentary counterparts assuming individuals are the same age, body size and participate in similar non-physically active daily activities. Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance means that active individuals need to replace the water and electrolytes lost in sweat. Nearly 25% of Americans use dietary supplements daily and ~35-40% use themoccasionally. For individuals engaged in physical activity, the estimates are as high as 50-100% (Sobal & Marquart, 1994). We now know that what you eat and drink can significantly impact health andexercise performance. The active individual needs to make sure they consumeenough energy to maintain a healthy body weight for their activity level and sport, while reducing risks of chronic disease. Active individuals need more carbohydrate and protein than sedentary individuals, and should not restrict fat intake too severely. Keeping well-hydrated and replacing fluids lost during exercise is also a key part of feeling good and performing at one’s best. Active individuals dieting for weight loss may need to supplement, but in general supplements should be used with caution and after careful examination of the diet.",

A profile of these 52 subjects aged 80 or older revealed that they were of average size or thin, and of a happy temperament; they ate well and regularly, slept adequately, avoided excessive amounts of alcohol, did not smoke, used drugs sparingly, and led an active life, physically and mentally. Also, it was apparent that the rugged elderly can withstand the impact of a major illness or a surgical operation with associated anesthesia. The following factors are important for longevity: 1) pick the right grandparents, 2) keep active physically and mentally, 3) eat properly, 4) stay thin, 5) drink alcohol moderately if at all, and 6) do not smoke.",

      "abstract": "Se sabe que los fumadores tienen mas riesgo de desarrollar un trastorno mental que aquellos que no fuman, presentando segun algunas series niveles mas elevados de ansiedad y depresion de forma basal. Incluso el propio intento de abandono o la reduccion del numero de cigarrillos podria determinar un mayor riesgo de aparicion de un episodio depresivo mayor. Sin embargo, lo que sucede tras un periodo mas o menos largo de abstinencia con la sintomatologia ansiosodepresiva no esta del todo esclarecido. Ademas, existe una clara asociacion entre tabaquismo y enfermedad mental, con una prevalencia de tabaquismo que alcanza mas del doble que la poblacion general. Esta circunstancia se relaciona con un mayor riesgo de recaidas, peores tasas de abandono y sintomatologia de abstinencia mas severa, suponiendo un importante reto en una consulta de deshabituacion tabaquica. Por otro lado, se dispone de evidencia suficiente acerca de la utilidad de los farmacos de primera linea para el abandono del tabaco (terapia sustitutiva con nicotina (TSN), Bupropion y Varenicline) en pacientes sanos, aunque la evidencia en psiquiatricos es mas limitada ya que se excluyeron de los estudios de comercializacion. Sin embargo, existen ciertas cautelas en su empleo en relacion a la posibilidad de un mayor riesgo de efectos neuropsiquiatricos graves en pacientes con y sin antecedentes psiquiatricos, circunstancia que no esta del todo aclarada en la literatura y que ha conllevado la inclusion de una alerta negra en las cajas de los dos medicamentos por la US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Aunque no existe contraindicacion para el empleo de estos farmacos en pacientes psiquiatricos, la monitorizacion estrecha deberia ser la norma. En base a lo anterior, se pretendio valorar la influencia de un programa de abandono del tabaco llevado a cabo en una unidad secundaria hospitalaria de deshabituacion tabaquica en el estado emocional de los pacientes mediante la medicion de los niveles de ansiedad/depresion a lo largo del mismo y las posibles diferencias en funcion de la presencia de antecedentes psiquiatricos. Para ello, se llevo a cabo un estudio de cohortes observacional, longitudinal y prospectivo, de la practica clinica habitual, con inclusion consecutiva de pacientes que acudieron a la Unidad de Deshabituacion Tabaquica del Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena para dejar de fumar entre marzo 2011 y octubre de 2012. Se incluyeron a todos los fumadores mayores de edad con un consumo acumulado > 10 paquetes/ano que aceptaron participar en el programa de abandono. Se excluyeron mujeres embarazadas o en periodo de lactancia, personas tratadas exclusivamente con parches de nicotina, que no comprendieran las indicaciones del cuestionario de ansiedad/depresion que se utilizo o que rechazaran participar en el estudio. Se llevo a cabo un programa de tratamiento farmacologico y de tipo cognitivo-conductual de 5 visitas (basal, a los 15 dias, primer, segundo y tercer mes). La pauta de tratamiento fue de 150 o 300 mg para Bupropion y de 1 mg/12 horas para Varenicline (previa titulacion) con una duracion de 8 semanas en los dos casos. El tratamiento se indico en todos los casos por el mismo neumologo que decidio la medicacion en funcion de las caracteristicas de cada paciente (antecedentes psiquiatricos, toma de medicacion concomitante, intentos previos, preferencias del paciente y costo). Se valoraron los sintomas de ansiedad y depresion mediante el empleo de la escala hospitalaria de ansiedad y depresion (HADS). Esta medicion se llevo a cabo tanto en la visita basal como 1er y 3er mes del seguimiento. De la misma manera se comprobo abstinencia mediante cooximetria y entrevista clinica. Todos los casos en los que no se pudo constatar la abstinencia (imposibilidad de contactar y o medir CO) fueron considerados como recaidas. Finalmente se incluyo un poblacion de 678 fumadores.\n Ver mas",

      "title": "Effets retardés des pesticides sur la santé humaine",
      "abstract": "Les pesticides, de par leurs proprietes intrinseques, representent un danger potentiel pour l’homme en cas de contact inopine. Leur usage, professionnel ou domestique, suscite de nombreuses interrogations quant aux consequences deleteres qu’ils pourraient avoir sur la sante. Si les effets des intoxications aigues sont assez bien connus, les consequences a long terme, suite a des expositions chroniques, le sont beaucoup moins. Les approches toxicologiques in vitro ou in vivo chez l’animal ne sont pas toujours adaptees pour predire les effets nefastes retardes dans les populations humaines. Les multiples expositions auxquelles sont confrontees les populations rendent souvent difficile l’etablissement d’un lien de causalite entre l’exposition a un produit donne et son eventuel effet sanitaire. Toutefois, et en depit des limitations methodologiques des approches epidemiologiques, des donnees convergentes ont permis d’acquerir quelques certitudes et des suspicions assez consistantes quant aux effets deleteres a long terme pour certains pesticides ou familles chimiques de pesticides. Il n’en reste pas moins que de trop nombreuses incertitudes persistent. Celles-ci ne pourront etre levees que par des etudes rigoureuses utilisant des mesures specifiques et sensibles des expositions, d’une part, et des effets sanitaires, y compris a des stades precoces, d’autre part. A ce jour, les atteintes de la fonction de reproduction, les troubles neurologiques et les pathologies cancereuses sont les effets sanitaires les plus frequemment evoques en relation avec des expositions chroniques aux pesticides. Cette revue s’efforcera de brosser quelques evidences et, surtout, de rappeler les nombreuses incertitudes qui subsistent en matiere d’effets retardes des pesticides sur la sante humaine.",

      "title": "Alcohol consumption and suicide",
      "abstract": "About 90% of people in Western countries use alcohol at some time in their lives, and 40% experience temporary or permanent alcohol-related impairment in some area of life as a result of drinking. Multiple sociocultural and environmental factors influence suicide rates, and thus studies conducted in one nation are not always applicable to other nations. Impulsivity and aggression are strongly implicated in suicidal behaviour. Constructs related to aggression and impulsivity confer additional risk for suicidal behaviour in people with alcohol dependence. Lower serotonin activity is tied to increased aggression/impulsivity, which in turn may enhance the probability of suicidal behaviour. Acute alcohol use is associated with suicide. Suicide completers have high rates of positive blood alcohol. Intoxicated people are more likely to attempt suicide using more lethal methods. Alcohol may be important in suicides among individuals with no previous psychiatric history. Alcohol dependence is an important risk factor for suicidal behaviour. Mood disorder is a more powerful risk factor for suicide among problem drinkers as age increases. All individuals with alcohol use disorders should be assessed for suicide, especially at the end of a binge or in the very early phase of withdrawal. Middle-age and older men with alcohol dependence and mood disorders are at particularly high risk.",

The most common reasons for inadvertent use of prohibited substances in sport occur through taking drugs for the treatment of medical conditions, taking supplements or using recreational substances of abuse. The inadvertent use of prohibited substances is recognised by anti-doping agencies; however, the onus to prove no fault or negligence rests with the athlete. Sanctions for inadvertent doping vary according to the degree to which the athlete was negligent. Athlete Support Personnel have an important role to play in reducing the incidence of inadvertent use of prohibited substances in sport.",

      "abstract": "Patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) should not use benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, insomnia, or anything else, for the same reasons that they should not drink any alcohol or use other drugs, regardless of their primary drug used. Once the addiction “switch” is thrown on, it never again goes off. This question has additional relevance today because in 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration put black box warnings on all benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics about the serious risks associated with their concomitant use. Anxiety is not a benzodiazepine-deficiency disease. It is possible to treat anxiety and insomnia without medicines of any kind, and it is possible to use medicines other than benzodiazepines for these common and serious mental disorders. Although many patients with SUDs are eager to use benzodiazepines, using alternatives is often effective and it does not put the patient's recovery in jeopardy. The standard I propose here is based on the experience of many people with SUDs who have tried and failed to use benzodiazepines for anxiety.",

      "abstract": "You need to ensure that you are not mistaking haemoptysis with: • Haematemesis: brownish-red blood that is vomited from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. • Epistaxis (nosebleed): particularly a posterior nosebleed. • Bleeding gums: combined with a cough, this may be confused with true haemoptysis. To tell if it is really haemoptysis, you can ask the patient where they think the blood is coming from (they may say it initially dripped from their nose), its colour (darker, coffee-ground appearance suggests partially digested blood), any history of nosebleeds, nausea, vomiting, gastric disease, or alcoholism. For the latter, asking if he is an alcoholic is unlikely to yield a valid response. Instead, you can try the TACE questions to detect alcohol dependence: . . . Does it Take more than three drinks to make you feel high? Have you ever been Annoyed by people’s criticism of your drinking? Are you trying to Cut down on drinking? Have you ever used alcohol as an Eye-opener in the morning? A positive response to the first question scores 2 points and a positive response to each of the rest, scores 1 point each. A positive response to two of these four questions is considered to indicate possible alcohol abuse or dependence as does a total score of two or more points. Haemoptysis should always be investigated thoroughly for two reasons: 1 It may be the presenting symptom for life-threatening lung disease. 2 Massive haemoptysis, variably defined as anything from &gt;100 mL to &gt;1000 mL over 24 hours, may be life-threatening itself, usually through asphyxiation but potentially also shock. Haemoptysis is thus a ‘red flag’ symptom and any patient with haemoptysis requires a thorough diagnostic work-up. These can be grouped together under a ‘surgical sieve’—we have used INVITED MD: Infective: pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), bronchitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, mycetoma Neoplastic: primary lung cancer, metastatic lung cancer Vascular: pulmonary embolism, left ventricular failure, bleeding diathesis (i.e. a bleeding tendency e.g. coagulopathy, severe thrombocytopenia), arteriovenous malformation, vascular–bronchial fistula Inflammatory: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener’s granulomatosis), Goodpasture’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome), polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis",

      "abstract": "Extract Oral hygiene in older people Key concepts The importance of teeth Teeth are important for chewing a wide range of food, and also for social and cosmetic reasons. Tooth retention is associated with better quality of life. A minimum of 21 teeth, arranged in opposable pairs, are needed in order to eat a varied diet. People with fewer teeth will require dentures to eat efficiently. Recent studies have shown that over 20% of nursing home residents have significant unmet oral health needs, and those with dementia often have even poorer oral health. Poor oral health has adverse consequences such as bad breath, toothache, bleeding gums, tooth loss, and poor nutrition. It is therefore important to promote good oral healthcare in the future older population. Normal ageing of the teeth and mouth Teeth naturally alter colour with age, both as a consequence of increased levels of mineralization in dentine making it more opaque, and from extrinsic staining related to tea, coffee, and other products. Gum recession may occur, exposing more of the root of the tooth (hence the phrase ‘long in the tooth’), making teeth technically more challenging to clean. Teeth will become more worn as a result of chewing and sometimes bruxism. The numbers of taste buds decline from middle age and result in a less sensitive sense of taste, which when combined with reductions in the sense of smell reduces people's enjoyment of food. There are significant reductions in the orofacial musculature, making chewing a more laborious process. Thinning of the oral mucosa may result in increased sensitivity to stimuli and a sense of burning in the mouth. The bone of the jaws may be affected by osteoporosis, although when teeth are present the jaw remains a functional matrix.",

      "title": "Toxicology Rounds",
      "abstract": "FigureFigureTwo young men in Greenbrier, TN, died earlier this year after ingesting dewshine, a homemade mixture of the soft drink Mountain Dew combined with racing fuel. Logan Stephenson, 16, was found dead at home in his bed on Jan. 21, and his friend, JD Byram, also 16, was taken to the hospital after he began seizing later that day. He died four days later. The fuel involved in these cases was almost pure methanol. It was apparently added with the intention of producing a rapid and intense effect. Some who have tried dewshine reportedly call it moonshine on steroids. Methanol is far less intoxicating than ethanol, but it is likely that young people who drink dewshine think the racing fuel actually contains ethanol or do not realize how toxic methanol is. The lethal dose of methanol in adults is 50-60 mL, but retinal damage and visual impairment can occur after ingestion of as little as 10 mL. Two tablespoons of methanol can be fatal to a child. Mountain Dew has a long and fascinating history that intersects with toxicology. It was first marketed in the 1940s as a caffeinated soda meant to be mixed with whiskey. Early advertisements, which laid on moonshine imagery with a heavy hand, featured a character called Willy the Hillbilly who was often pictured swigging from a homemade jug labeled Mountain Dew. The tag line was, “It'll tickle your innards.” The term mountain dew, in fact, was a longstanding euphemism for illegal whiskey. The first known use of the term to denote moonshine was in 1816, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. Mountain Dew is now owned by PepsiCo, which recently introduced a clear, lemon-lime version under the unfortunate trademark Dewshine. This drink is nonalcoholic, and should not be confused with the homemade mixture involved in the fatal cases from Tennessee. A rumor also circulated for years that surreptitiously submitting a sample of Diet Mountain Dew was a good way to beat a drug screen because it looked and smelled like urine. This ruse certainly no longer works because routine analysis will detect the absence of creatinine in the sample. It is not clear whether the Tennessee dewshine cases represent an isolated incident or a broader phenomenon. It seems like a good time, however, to review some of the less-appreciated fine points in managing methanol toxicity. Serum methanol levels do not correlate well with toxicity. Methanol itself is not toxic and does not produce acidosis, but it is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to formaldehyde, which is then converted by aldehyde dehydrogenase into formic acid. (See figure.) The formic acid causes high-anion-gap acidosis and is directly toxic to the retina. Clinicians deciding whether to institute hemodialysis in these cases should consider manifestations of severe toxicity — metabolic acidosis, new visual defects, seizures, and coma — to be much more important indicators than the methanol level, which is usually not available in a timely fashion. Some patients with methanol poisoning can be managed using fomepizole alone without hemodialysis. Patients who present early after ingesting methanol may have converted very little into the toxic metabolic formic acid. Timely administration of fomepizole will inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase and block further accumulation of formic acid. A patient without signs of severe toxicity and with normal renal function will eliminate the fomepizole over several days. Hemodialysis enhances clearance of methanol and possibly shortens the length of stay in the ICU, but it may not be necessary for a good clinical outcome. Toxicologists still do not agree completely on when hemodialysis can be omitted because every case is different. The local poison center can provide guidance and certainly should be consulted on all cases of known or suspected methanol ingestion. Dosing fomepizole can be tricky. The initial loading dose of fomepizole is 15 mg/kg IV, followed by 10 mg/kg IV every 12 hours as indicated. It is important to note, however, that fomepizole induces and accelerates its own metabolism after about two days. Increase the dose after 48 hours to 15 mg/kg every 12 hours. Fomepizole has a low volume of distribution and is not strongly bound to protein, so its elimination is accelerated by hemodialysis. The dosing interval for fomepizole is changed to every four hours when a patient is receiving dialysis. Methanol poisoning can cause basal ganglia infarction and hemorrhage. Intracranial hemorrhage is a rare but well described complication of methanol poisoning. It is not clear whether this is a result of direct toxicity or methanol-induced vasospasm. The most common areas affected are the putamen and the cerebral deep white matter. Any patient who presents after ingesting methanol with severe acidosis and impaired mental status not attributable to acute intoxication should have a head CT or MRI. Neurological impairment caused by these lesions can be irreversible. Some authors argue that systemic anticoagulation may increase the risk for hemorrhagic brain lesions in these cases and should be avoided. Extracorporeal treatment (ECTR) can be performed without systemic anticoagulation by frequent flushing of the ECTR circuit by saline or regional anticoagulation, according to the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup. (Crit Care Med 2015;43[2]:461.) The most important aspect of treating methanol poisoning is supportive care, along with use of an ADH blocker or hemodialysis as indicated. These cases are not at all straightforward, and the local poison control center can provide advice about the fine points of management. Share this article on Twitter and Facebook.

      "abstract": "Many young adults experience chronic pain and given its wide availability and potential pain reducing properties, young adults may use cannabis to self-medicate for pain. However, little is known about young adult users’ perceptions of potential health risks and benefits of cannabis, and whether these perceptions differ by chronic pain status. As a part of a larger study, young adult recreational cannabis users (N=176, ages 18-29) who reported using at least once a week completed assessments of use frequency and perceived cannabis-related risks and benefits. The sample had a high proportion of participants who met criteria for chronic pain (51.1%). The majority of the sample reported using daily or multiple times daily (80.7%) with an average of 2.68 (SD=1.42) sessions per day across administration modes (e.g. smoking, edibles, tinctures). Participants answered questions about their lifetime chances of experiencing five cannabis-related risks (personal harm, negative health outcome, negative mental health outcome, harming someone else, increased pain) and benefits (personal benefit, positive health outcome, positive mental health outcome, benefitting someone else, decreased pain; 1=Very low to 7=Very high). Overall, young adult users perceived their risk to be very low (M=1.62, SD=.73) and 40.3% of the sample had an average risk score (combined across the five risk items) of 1.00, while only one participant reported an average risk above 4.00. In particular, participants reported a low lifetime chance of experiencing personal harm (M=1.51, SD=.90), harming someone else (M=1.20, SD=.58), or experiencing increased pain (M=1.24, SD=.74) due to their cannabis use. In contrast, young adult users perceived somewhat high chances of experiencing benefits related to their cannabis use (M=4.78, SD=1.46). In particular, participants perceived a high chance of experiencing reduced pain (M=5.88, SD=1.55), personal benefit (M=4.84, SD=1.86), and positive mental health outcomes (M=4.82, SD=1.77). There was no difference based on pain status on frequency of use, average daily sessions, or perceived risks, and only one difference in perceived benefits. Participants without chronic pain anticipated more personal benefit from cannabis use (M=5.15, SD=1.74) than those with chronic pain (M=4.53, SD=1.94, t(171)=2.21, p=.03). Overall, results suggest young adult recreational users perceive very low risks of their cannabis consumption and moderately high benefits, regardless of pain status. Looking at individual areas of potential risk and benefits may yield targets for future health education campaigns. For example, perceptions of low risk/high benefits regarding mental health outcomes may not be accurate for this heavy using sample.",

      "abstract": "Taste disturbances are common among the elderly due to physiologic changes, diseases, and medications. As many as 11% of elderly persons using multiple drugs report taste aberrations. The main danger of taste decline and disturbance in the old is food-anhedonia, causing loss of body weight via decreased calorie and nutrient intake.To overview drug related taste disturbances emphasizing the elderly.Review of Hebrew and English medical literature.Taste-disturbances can be divided into hypogeusia [diminished sense of taste], ageusia [absence of taste], and the 2 types of dysgeusia [taste distortion]: aliageusia [food related] and phantogeusia [taste illusions]. The mechanisms by which drugs impair taste are numerous, and may be related to drug chemical structure. The treatment of taste disturbances is empiric and has limited success. Treatments include: shifting drugs within the same class, zinc replacement (proven to enhance taste sensation for sweet, bitter and salty flavors), palliative measures (use of mints, sugarless chewing-gums, and bicarbonate mouthwashes), niacin and vitamin A ameliorate hypo and dysgeusia.Disturbed taste sensation is common among the elderly, and should be considered whenever unexplained nutritional decline is present. Scrupulous drug screening is mandatory, and other intervention modalities can be beneficial.",

El alcohol es una de las drogas, que por su facil acceso y su poderosa propaganda que recibe, se ha convertido en un verdadero problema social en todos los paises y en todas las edades. Los estudiantes universitarios han consumido alcohol por lo menos una vez en su vida y, quiza, haya tomado de mas en alguna ocasion. Esto puede ser normal, pues que un estudiante universitario tome bebidas alcoholicas siendo caracteristico de su edad. Pero cuando el joven lo hace con frecuencia y sin medida, su vida se ve afectada en terminos de su desempeno y calidad, entonces el muchacho es un alcoholico. La problematica derivada del consumo de alcohol en los jovenes es diferente a la del adulto. En los jovenes, las consecuencias negativas derivadas del consumo de alcohol, suelen referirse a alteraciones de las relaciones con la familia, companeros y maestros, bajo rendimiento escolar, agresiones, violencias, alteraciones del orden publico y conductas de alto riesgo, como conducir tras haber bebido, asi como actividades sexuales que conllevan embarazos no deseados o enfermedades de transmision sexual.

They have various reasons such as frustration with life, peer pressure, just for fun or even a rebellion gesture towards the norms of civil society, any one is good enough to led them to the world of drugs. In recent years, the problem of drug abuse among youth has reached epidemic proportions. India has become a country of drug culture. They use drug on awaking (coffee or tea), throughout the day (cigarettes, certain soft drinks) as a way to relax (alcohol) and to reduce pain (aspirin). In our youth group become more attractive toward substance abuse and different types of drug for pleasure and entertainment. They do not know the impact of substance and drug abuse. Drug abuse can lead to drug dependence or addiction. Drug dependence arises out of a maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to a cluster of behavioural, cognitive and psychological phenomenon that develops after repeated intake. It includes a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences. Higher priority is given to drug use than other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal state. Total 400 (200 Drug users and 200 Non-drug users) were taken from different four colleges situated in Darbhanga district of north Bihar area. The age ranges of sample were from 18 to 25 years with an average age range of 22 years. The purposive sampling technique was adhered during sample selection time.",

      "abstract": "Risky drinking seems to be very popular among young people in Europe. The presentation will discuss if primary care physicians might play some role in preventing alcohol-related harm such as severe intoxications, accidents, injuries, violence, risky sexual behaviour, depression, suicidal tendencies, progression to dependency, or impairment of developmental processes. Adolescents’ stated reasons for consuming alcohol appear to be very similar to those adults give—a tradition of drinking in their region or country, sociability, relaxation, testing out limits and pleasure. Most young people are mainly experimenting or occasionally consuming alcohol, generally learning an appropriate mastery of alcohol consumption between middle to late adolescence and young adulthood. Some young people, however, drink to cope with psychological distress, to forget problems, for example in families, schools or other relationships and are at risk of becoming long-term, large-scale consumers developing misuse and dependency, especially when “binge-drinking”. In primary care institutions young people are rarely, if at all, and mostly superficially asked about their alcohol use, although primary care physicians are in a unique position to offer low-threshold support for many everyday lifestyle-related problems. Main barriers to screening and counselling are insufficient time and lack of training in effective communication. The presentation will give some hints on easily applicable techniques that allow access to those young people who are at risk of developing alcohol use disorders and are in need of support.",

      "abstract": "Through doping, we understand the use by athletes of substances prohibited by the anti-doping agencies in order to gain a competitive advantage. Since sport plays an important role in physical and mental education and in promoting international understanding and cooperation, the widespread use of doping products and methods has consequences not only on health of the athletes, but also upon the image of sport. Thus, doping in sports is forbidden for both ethical and medical reasons. Narcotics and analgesics, anabolic steroids, hormones, selective androgen receptor modulators are among the most frequently utilized substances. Although antidoping controls are becoming more rigorous, doping and, very importantly, masking doping methods are also advancing, and these are usually one step ahead of doping detection techniques. Depending on the sport practiced and the physical attributes it requires, the athletes will look for one or more of the following benefits of doping: recovering from an injury, increasing body recovery capacity after training, increasing muscle mass and strength, decreasing fat tissue, increasing endurance. Finally, when we look once again at a doping scandal, amazed at how much animosity against those caught can exist; the question is: is it really such a disaster as presented by the media or a silent truth under our eyes, but which many of us have refused to accept?",

      "abstract": "The recent attempt to poison Ukrainian President, Viktor Yuschenko with dioxins, raised public concern regarding this toxic chemical. In industrial countries, there is a constitutive exposure of humans to dioxin compounds, which are formed as by-products in manufacturing processes of various chlorinated organic chemicals and in waste incinerators. Dioxins are extremely stable in the environment and have a low turnover rate in the body--sometimes they are detected years after the original exposure. Of the dioxins, the most notoriously famous is the TCDD (2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). Dioxins exhibit high acute toxicity in various animal species. Humans, however, are considered less susceptible and so far there were no reported deaths following acute dioxin poisoning. Nevertheless, numerous adverse health effects are attributed to dioxin exposure. The most prominent is the chloracne--an acute acneiform eruption, usually appearing on facial skin. There is a solid evidence base that some dioxins are carcinogens. Other long-term deleterious effects of dioxin include: immunosuppression, effects on reproduction, impairments in developmental, neurological and cognitive functions in infants, increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and various hormonal alterations. The action of dioxins resembles that of hormones, since their toxicity is mostly receptor-mediated. Dioxins manifest their toxicity in extremely low concentrations. Although there are compounds that exhibit their biological activity at even lower dose range (e.g. nerve gases), this potency of dioxins is considered extraordinary, since there is an every-day exposure to dioxins through environmental vectors mostly via the food chain. Until now, there is no antidotal cure for dioxins, but only symptomatic treatment combined with techniques that accelerate its excretion rate from the body.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents consume alcohol in moderation mainly to enjoy and enhance mood but adolescents also drink hazardously, e.g. to cope with stressful life events. Drinking hazardously may be related to the developing adolescent brain going through a number of structural and physiological changes. These structural and physiological changes affect adolescent behavior aimed at gaining experience in life. Adolescent drinking patterns vary and may include risky behaviors such as binge drinking. Motivations to drink and risk factors for binge drinking and alcohol abuse are both internal and external. Internal risk factors include amongst others genetic predisposition to have less self-control, whereas external risk factors includes early life stress. Integrative approaches underline the value of multi-domain analysis for prediction; any one feature in isolation only modestly predicts drinking behavior. Health consequences of drinking vary widely depending on dose and drinking pattern. Moderate alcohol drinking may be associated with a lower incidence of chronic disease and mental health, whereas alcohol binging and abuse appear to negatively affect social functioning mainly in the short term and mental and physical health in the long term. Resilience towards behaving non responsibly may best prevent alcohol abuse and stimulate enjoyment of moderate alcohol consumption. Limitations in current knowledge concern the interpretation of alcohol drinking being the cause for adolescent risky behavior, generalizability of findings on abusing adolescents to the general population and insufficient knowledge of relevant covariates and mediators.",

Diffusion forekommer nastan overallt, aven om man inte alltid kan se det. Exempelvis bestar all den luft som vi andas in av en mangd molekyler som diffunderar fram och tillbaka. Eller sa kan det vara vattenmolekyler som diffunderar in till platen pa bilen och gor sa att den rostar, eller varfor inte syremolekyler som diffunderar in i juiceforpackningar och forstor bade smaken och hallbarheten pa juicen. I de tva senare fallen galler det att skydda sig mot sadana angrepp. Hur ska detta ga till? Det galler att pa nagot satt hindra molekylerna att tranga igenom. Hindrad diffusion kan aven utnyttjas positivt. I lakemedelsindustrin anvands numera ofta lakemedel med kontrollerad frisattning, d.v.s. man ser till att lakemedlet endast lamnar tabletten nar den ar pa ratt plats i kroppen och med en konstant hastighet. Pa sa satt kan man minska den nodvandiga dosen och anda fa ett battre resultat. For att lyckas med saval rostskyddet som den effektivare lakemedelsdoseringen ar det viktigt att forsta hur diffusionen fungerar. Min forskning har jag darfor agnat at att forsoka beskriva diffusionsfenomenet och hur det paverkas av olika sorters hinder. I min avhandling har jag anvant modeller for att beskriva den hindrade diffusionen. Jag har anvant mig av foljande tva system, alkoholproduktion fran socker med hjalp av jast immobiliserad (fangad) i alginatgel och adsorption (bindning) av proteiner i agarosgelskulor. For att kunna fa hjalp med vissa parametrar har jag aven matt diffusionen med hjalp av en utrustning som har tillverkats pa institutionen for kemiteknik. Bada de studerade systemen bestar av en gel. En gel har en struktur som liknar en tvattsvamps, d.v.s. stora haligheter som kan samla upp vatten. Trots att en gel oftast bestar av mer an 90% vatten hindras molekylerna avsevart. En jamforelse kan goras med nar man springer pa ett oppet falt eller nar man springer i en snarig skog. Immobiliseringstekniken ansags vara en stor nyhet nar den forst upptacktes. Man trodde att den skulle anvandas flitigt i manga processer. Tyvarr fick inte tekniken det forvantade genomslaget pa grund av problemen med diffusionen in och ut ur kulorna. I det forsta systemet hindras sockret fran att diffundera in i kulorna av bade gelen och jasten. Sockret omvandlas, nar det val kommit in, till etanol och diffunderar sedan ut igen. Jag har byggt upp ett simuleringsprogram som kan anvandas for att oka forstaelsen for hur samverkan mellan diffusionen och reaktionen fungerar. Resultaten visar att hur jasten ar placerad i kulan inte har nagon avgorande betydelse sa lange kulan ar relativt liten. Dock kommer det alltid att finnas mest jast vid ytan beroende pa tillgang till socker och kulans volymforhallande (storsta delen av volymen ligger valdigt nara ytan). Proteiner anvands flitigt inom bade bioteknik och lakemedelsindustrin. Har stalls stora krav pa renhet. For att kunna framstalla en tillrackligt ren produkt kravs det att man kan separera olika proteiner fran varandra. En teknik som ar vanlig vid proteinseparation ar kromatografi. Da later man proteinerna rora sig i en kolonn och beroende pa deras egenskaper, passerar de igenom kolonnen olika fort. Sjalva innanmatet i kromatografikolonnen bestar ofta av sma kulor av agarosgel. I affinitetskromatografi, som jag anvant som system, diffunderar proteinerna in i gelkulorna och fastnar. Aven har har jag skapat ett simuleringsprogram som ska hjalpa till att forsta hur och varfor olika fenomen upptrader nar proteinmolekylerna diffunderar och binder till andra molekyler. Modellen klarar av flera olika sorters inbindning och flera olika proteiner. Resultaten fran simuleringsprogrammet stammer val overens med experimentella data. I arbetet har jag visat att det ar mojligt att beskriva hindrad diffusion genom matematisk modellering och simulering. Dock bor man notera att en modell inte blir battre an indata man har. Darfor maste man alltid verifiera sina resultat med experiment. Simuleringen gor att man sparar tid och kanske slipper gora alltfor manga experiment. (Less)",

Thus it was not easy to refrain. Moreover , these offenders had a low standard of living, and a low level of education. Therefore, they had an urge to try drugs as an escape. After their first use of drugs they felt relaxed by the effects of the drugs. As a result, they become happy, relaxed, and they could work better. This made the drug users want to continue the use. Also, these drug users had a belief that heroin was the most dangerous kind of drug. Thery believed that other kinds of drugs were safer than heroin, and therefore not dangerous . Moreover, those who lived near the offenders did not pay particular attention to drug addiction problems. These factors contributed to the tendency to use drugs continuously. Finally , they became addicted to drugs. It was found that each drug user had tried more than on kind of drug.

In addition, heavy drinking tends to be associated with heavy smoking. A large majority of alcoholics, who by definition are heavy drinkers, smoke. A number of studies examining the effects of ethanol pretreatment or availability on tobacco consumption have demonstrated that ethanol potentiates tobacco consumption. Whether smoking potentiates alcohol consumption is not known. Possible mechanisms underlying the alcohol/tobacco association, including cross-tolerance between the two drugs, are discussed. Tobacco appears to counteract the deleterious effects of alcohol on some measures of performance. The association between alcohol and tobacco consumption may have some relevance regarding the issue of relapse to either one of the drugs. Finally, combined use of alcohol and tobacco presents greater risk of certain diseases than the sum of the excess risks of alcohol and tobacco considered individually.",

Los programas preventivos para evitar su uso han resultado poco efectivos y escasamente atractivos porque no reflejan la realidad juvenil ni ofrecen razones que desalienten la busqueda de nuevas emociones, de sensaciones de placer y de estados de relajacion, que motivan el consumo. Son programas ineficaces porque no generan ni fortalecen los recursos y estrategias de los jovenes para sobreponerse a la influencia de sus pares, no solo para el inicio o sosten del consumo de mariguana, sino de incurrir a otras practicas de riesgo que identifican al grupo y otorgan identidad a sus miembros. En este trabajo nos propusimos conocer los significados y valores que los usuarios otorgan a la mariguana, para sustentar politicas y programas eficientes, que propongan e impulsen una oferta de satisfactores que no estan incorporados y que muchos consumidores atribuyen a esta droga, tales como el acceso y disfrute de la cultura, el deporte, la naturaleza, el uso adecuado de tiempo libre, la existencia de espacios recreativos publicos y seguros, y la participacion en actividades de promocion social, entre otros aspectos.

Smokeless tobacco (ST) use among Indiana youngsters is higher than its use among youngsters nationally. More than 10% of current Indiana high school junior and senior female students report some ST usage. ST ingestion causes addiction and serious health consequences, including various forms of cancer and significant dental diseases. It is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. Nicotine levels in ST are very high, and ST intake is rapidly addicting. Tobacco companies have been accused of \"graduating\" youthful customers from flavored lower-nicotine \"starter\" products to forms that contain a more highly concentrated nicotine content. Clinicians should routinely ask children, teens and adults about ST use. Early intervention in youth who are experimenting with ST or using \"starter\" products may prevent addiction and disease. Physicians should be alert to the intraoral physical signs of ST use. To strengthen their tobacco intervention skills, physicians should require continuing education training regarding ST.",

      "title": "Risks of flavored nicotine and nicotine-free substances on adolescents",
      "abstract": "Nicotinic substances, tobacco, and vape pods have been widely used in electronic cigarettes that have been increasing in global popularity among adolescents. Global rise in electronic cigarettes and vaping devices are mainly being promoted through social media platforms such as Instagram advertisements and TikTok commercials1,2. Particularly, the inhalation (vaping) of electronic cigarettes contains toxic particles such as nicotine combined with various flavors that are delivered to the lungs and brain. Chronic vaping of toxic particles can cause addiction, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and increased risks of hypoxemia3,4. Recent commercials promote non-nicotine (0 mg) vape pods consisting of harmful particles that target adolescents to smoke electronic cigarettes and to keep up with current societal norms1,4. Ultrafine particles found in vaping products can harm vital organs such as the lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, and cause neurological dependence on flavored nicotinic substances3,4. A recent study by Smith and colleagues includes computed tomography images of the lungs when exposed to 90 days of smoking electronic cigarette particles to cause acute lung injury. The computed tomography images show ground-glass opacities associated with consolidation in the lungs that can clinically manifest as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, alveolar hemorrhage, and/or respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease3. Flavored inhalation of nicotine or nicotine-free substances increases the risks of lung injury and can cause oxidative stress in the body. A similar study by Caporale and colleagues emphasizes the toxicity of non-nicotine electronic cigarettes to impact the endothelial function of a healthy nonsmoker. Specifically, the study highlights when nonsmokers went through magnetic resonance imaging before and after inhaling nicotine-free cigarette aerosol, there was vascular resistance in the arterioles which resulted in lowering venous hemoglobin saturation that may be a result of hypoxemia. Regardless of smoking, nicotine or nicotine-free substances some microparticles can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which can cause adverse reactions such as neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity4. Therefore, limiting electronic cigarettes in the market should be implemented to promote the healthy development of adolescents. Should the government implement school classes to educate adolescents about the dangers of electronic cigarettes? The benefits of public awareness about the toxicity of vaping outweigh the potential government spending that may be required. Educating the youth about the dangers of vaping can limit its usage and can promote normal adolescent development. However, there is a rise in non-nicotine vape pods, which were originally introduced to assist chronic smokers in quitting conventional cigarettes. Now nicotine-free vape pods are being used as a stepping stone for young individuals to start vaping and potentially use products with nicotine. Some suggestions to counter the rise of vaping can be to increase the prices of electronic cigarettes, raise taxes on each purchase, increase the minimum age to buy vaping devices, and monitor social media advertisements. Another way to curb and limit the usage of nicotine vaping devices in the community is to dispense electronic cigarettes with medical prescriptions. Moreover, a common problem that educational institutions may face is the rise in social media trends that use vaping as a way for students to bond with one another. To counter this trend, institutions should ensure healthier social groups by introducing clubs such as sports, gaming, drama, art, and cooking, or promoting any gathering of students' interest that avoids inhalation or ingestion of toxic microparticles. Therefore, electronic cigarettes should be difficult to purchase for adolescents and further research is necessary on non-nicotine vaping devices and the potential pathologic problems that could cause chronic diseases or halt normal development.

This class of foods for specific health uses are designed to assist in the prevention or treatment of disease, or to enhance and improve human capacities. They include products like vitamin-fortified grains, energy bars, low-fat or low-sodium foods, and sports drinks. Three sets of concerns about functional foods deserve attention. 1) Their health benefits are greatly exaggerated and, in many cases, non-existent; practical questions remain about their efficacy. 2) Their medicinal properties blur the boundaries between food and drugs; public health questions remain about their appropriate use, distribution, and regulation. 3) Their proliferation is fueled by the food industry, not by the medical profession; political questions remain about the role of market forces that too often benefit producers more than consumers.",

O jeho škodlivosti na ľudské zdravie, včítane jeho asociovaného negatívneho vplyvu na rodinné väzby príslušníkov alkoholikov, sa veľmi dobre vie. Ide o interdisciplinárny problém, ktorého riešenie si vyžaduje finančné vklady, celospoločenskú podporu, angažovanie širšej skupiny odborníkov a nakoniec aj aktívny prístup mládeže i dospelých k tomuto problému. Tu referujeme šesť letálnych prípadov intoxikácií etylalkoholom. Prvá kazuistika sa venuje žene, ktorá v opitosti umiera v herni. Druhý prípad uvádza muža, ktorý v opitosti umiera pri rybníku. Tretí opisuje priebeh výletu spojeného s pitím a úmrtím muža v aute. Štvrtý prípad je založený na báze celodenného popíjania a následným úmrtím muža. Piaty prípad opisuje priebeh bujarej oslavy, ktorá sa končí úmrtím muža. Posledný šiesty prípad dokumentuje ťažkú otravu muža alkoholom, ktorý v kombinácii s požitím kanabinoidov umiera na lavičke autobusovej stanice. Sú diskutované príčiny a dôvody vedúce k takýmto tragickým udalostiam. Upozorňuje sa na nebezpečenstvá, ktoré vyplývajú z nárazového pitia príležitostných konzumentov a tiež na nebezpečenstvá nárazového pitia osôb, ktoré dlhodobo v nadmerných dávkach užívajú alkoholické nápoje. Zvlášť je diskutovaná prevencia užívania alkoholických nápojov detí a mládeže, včítane prevencie alkoholizmu. Sú navrhnuté edukačné programy, ktoré by mohli odtabuizovať túto problematiku a v rámci toho formovať postoje detí, mládeže i dospelých na pitie alkoholu aj s očakávaním zníženia prípadov úmrtí intoxikáciou etylalkoholom v budúcnosti.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco cessation represents a multifaceted approach involving patients who often don't neatly fit into classic prototypes.Researchers found that current smokers experience a more than 10-year reduction in life expectancy compared to non-smokers, and more than half make an attempt each year, but less than 10% manage to stay smoke-free for at least 6 months.Therefore, it's recommended to employ a combination of methods and strategies, ranging from questionnaires to established medications.The role of the medical staff is and remains vital in this context.Nicotine is a potent drug due to its rapid absorption and swift diffusion into the central nervous system, and quitting nicotine leads to important consequences, such as craving, drug-seeking behaviour and withdrawal symptoms.Negative affective states also emerge, characterized by symptoms like depressed mood, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.Hierarchical multiple regression models have revealed that extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness and age are among the predictors of daily cigarette consumption.The authors discuss both traditional and innovative opportunities to expedite this process, while analysing the potential to enhance the compliance of healthcare providers and patients.Smoking cessation, the process of quitting smoking, can be approached through both pharmacological (medication-based) and non-pharmacological (behavioural and supportive) methods.The choice of approach or combination of approaches depends on individual preferences and needs. RezumatRenunțarea la fumat reprezintă o abordare complexă a unui pacient care adesea nu se încadrează în prototipurile clasice.Cercetările au evidențiat că fumătorii se confruntă cu o reducere de peste 10 ani a speranței de viață în comparație cu nefumătorii și mai mult de jumătate fac o încercare de a renunța în fiecare an, dar mai puțin de 10% reușesc să rămână abstinenți cel puțin 6 luni.Prin urmare, se recomandă utilizarea unei combinații de metode și strategii, de la chestionare la medicamente deja stabilite, iar rolul personalului medical este și rămâne vital în acest context.Nicotina este un drog puternic datorită absorbției și difuzării rapide în sistemul nervos central, iar renunțarea conduce la efecte secundare importante, precum dorința arzătoare, comportamentul de căutare a drogului și simptomele de sevraj.Apar și stări afective negative, caracterizate prin simptome precum depresie, anxietate, iritabilitate și insomnie.Modelele ierarhice de regresie multiplă au dezvăluit că extraversia, nevroticismul, conștiinciozitatea și vârsta se numără printre predictorii consumului zilnic de țigări.Autorii discută oportunități vechi și noi de a accelera acest proces analizând posibilitatea de a îmbunătăți complianța furnizorilor de servicii medicale și a pacienților.Procesul de renunțare la fumat, poate fi abordat atât prin metode farmacologice, cât și prin metode comportamentale și de susținere.Alegerea abordării sau combinația de abordări depinde de preferințele și nevoile individuale.",

      "title": "Flavoured hookah and perioperative risk: Evil goes global",
      "abstract": "Sir, Tobacco (cigarette/bidi) smoking is a recognised evil in anaesthesia practice due to its adverse effects on health and increased perioperative risks. Consequently, perioperative concerns of tobacco smoking have been elaborately discussed in literature.[1] Aware of the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, tobacco-free hookah (also known as flavoured hookah, waterpipe and shisha) is increasingly being promoted and used as a safer alternative despite its potential health hazards. However, adverse effects of hookah in anaesthesia practice have not been adequately addressed. This paper aims to discuss the harmful effects of flavoured hookah and its potential impact on perioperative course and outcomes. Flavoured hookah involves waterpipe system and flavoured constituent shisha, heated with charcoal. The popularity of flavoured hookah among adolescents and young adults in India and other Asian countries has increased significantly in recent times[2] and has been termed as 'public health epidemic' in the western world. Various factors such as availability of multiple flavours, less harshness of smoke, no or less nicotine and importantly, wrong perception of less or no risk associated with its use, are promoting its usage. Although nicotine is absent, smoke of flavoured hookah contains various toxicants such as carbon monoxide (CO), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), volatile aldehydes and heavy metals.[3] Effects of these products include cardiovascular diseases (CO), lung diseases (volatile aldehydes) and cancer (PAH and heavy metals). Similar to cigarettes, smoke from hookah can cause ciliary damage, increase viscosity of secretions, reduce muco-ciliary clearance and thus increase the risk of perioperative pulmonary complications. Hookah also disrupts respiratory epithelium, increases airway reactivity and can lead to perioperative bronchospasm or laryngospasm. High carboxyhaemoglobin levels increase the perioperative risk of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias. The air quality found in hookah cafes is also hazardous with a significant level of particulate matter (PM2.5)[3] which can exacerbate the risk of chronic bronchitis or asthma. Additional adverse effects include increased risk of communicable diseases due to sharing of single mouthpiece by users and potential for becoming permanent smokers or dual abuse (alcohol and hookah). Considerations during anaesthesia include high perioperative risk of respiratory (tissue hypoxia from decreased blood oxygen content and leftward shift in oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve) and cardiac morbidity (ischemia, negative inotropy and arrhythmias), misinterpretation of peripheral oxygen saturation with conventional pulse oximeters (similar absorbances of carboxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin at 660 nm), high carboxyhaemoglobin and low oxyhaemoglobin on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, need for modification of drug doses secondary to cytP450 enzyme induction by PAH, changing of CO2absorbent intraoperatively and need for FiO2 = 1 or hyperbaric oxygen to reduce carboxyhaemoglobin half-life.[4] In addition, preoperative evaluation should include chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, carboxyhaemoglobin levels[5] and ABG. Although no outcome relationship has been studied between flavoured hookah smoking and anaesthesia, increased perioperative risk is likely based on the described health hazards. In the absence of data, no recommendations currently are available regarding perioperative precautions, preoperative preparation, duration of abstinence prior to surgery and need for postponement of elective surgeries. To conclude, awareness among general public about potential health risks from use of flavoured hookah is needed, especially the youth who constitute 35% of India's population[6] and are most vulnerable to its use. Since many individuals do not consider its use as smoking and are unaware of its harmful effects, they may not inform about this habit during pre-anaesthetic evaluation. Anaesthesiologists should also be aware of this increasing public health problem and its ramifications in the perioperative period. We would encourage anaesthesiologists to actively seek information from patients about its use, discuss associated concerns, educate patients about its harms and take necessary perioperative measures similar to tobacco smoking.

      "abstract": "E-cigarettes, also known as electronic cigarettes or vape pens, have become increasingly popular in recent years as an alternative to traditional tobacco products. However, there is growing concern about the potential impact of e-cigarettes on oral and dental health. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the current evidence on the topic and to highlight the potential risks associated with e-cigarette use. One of the main concerns surrounding e-cigarettes is the potential for oral and dental health problems. E-cigarettes contain a liquid solution that is heated and inhaled as a vapor, and this vapor can contain a variety of chemicals and toxins. Some of these chemicals have been found to have adverse effects on oral health, including inflammation of the gums, dry mouth, and an increased risk of cavities. Additionally, the act of vaping itself can lead to oral health issues, as the repetitive motion of inhaling and exhaling can cause irritation to the mouth and throat. Furthermore, the nicotine content in e-cigarettes can also have negative effects on oral and dental health. Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it restricts blood flow, which can lead to a decrease in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the gums and other oral tissues. This can result in a higher risk of gum disease and delayed healing after oral surgery or dental procedures. In addition, nicotine has been shown to contribute to the development of oral cancer, as well as other oral health issues such as tooth decay and tooth loss. More research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on oral and dental health, but in the meantime, it is crucial for individuals to take steps to protect their oral health and to be aware of the potential risks associated with e-cigarette use.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse is the use of a substance that affects a normal state or even medical drugs but uses in the wrong doses or method that affects a person or others in dangerous ways. It impacts all aspects of a person's life; mental, physical, emotional, and social. Drug addiction is responsible for more deaths, illnesses, and disabilities than any other avoidable health problem. In the last century, most people decrease their use of smoking tobacco, and alcohol abuse but there are significantly elevated rates of using drugs. In some countries, they found that the use of the drug is more in males, and in other countries found more in females than males, it differs from one culture to other probably depend on many factors. Adolescents there are curious to deviate in ways even the competent of them and increase overtime with prevalence of newer drugs. They start using it at youth age, and most of them are university students. They think that it improves their life and academic performance, and they are easily influenced by their bad friends. In Sudan nowadays, we notice that drug abuse becomes a national issue because drug dealers and drugs user become at a higher rate than in the past, also the number of deaths from overdose is increasing, so we need more research about it. The Drug Enforcement Administration in every country spends a lot of money to catch drug dealers, stop cannabis delivery, and ended it to save their nation. It affects individual lives and then affects the community which leads to delays in the development of our country. In this Review, we discuss the effect of drugs on the most important aspects of adolescents' life.",

Generally inhaled, from steel bombs or balloons, Nitrous Oxide is today the 7th most popular drug in the world for its euphoric effects. We will present through a case report where psychiatric symptoms are significant, an overview of psychiatric complications, but also neurological and general of the recreational use of Nitrous Oxide. Indeed, this use, even recreational, can produce a series of neurological, psychiatric, hematological and respiratory symptoms. Its pathogenic mechanism remains largely unknown; there is no specific treatment apart from vitamin B12 supplementation. Therapeutic approaches are therefore based on motivational interviews and psychotherapies. Prevention campaigns among young people therefore seem necessary because they underestimate the dangers.",

Para dormir, tomamos somniferos; para paliar nuestras carencias en la vida de relacion, se acude al tabaco, al alcohol o al cannabis; para serenarnos tras la batalla, volvemos a los tranquilizantes; para rendir en el estudio o en el trabajo, se tomaba antes la centramina. En las mananas de los lunes, cuando se piensa en lo que queda hasta esa ilusion que es el fin de semana, un abanico de estimulantes/relajantes se extiende por el camino. No se conocen en su justa medida las razones por las que se tiende al consumo de sustancias que afectan en mayor o menor medida a nuestra actividad basal. La drogadiccion en sentido amplio, como cualquier comportamiento irregular, se acostumbra a explicar en terminos de disfuncion sociologica (el sistema social, en su defectuosidad, es el que propicia el consumo de drogas), de caracter (las limitaciones de muchos individuos para la integracion social les motiva a usar productos artificiales), o biologica (un deficit de dopamina en la composicion cerebral estimula la ingesta). Pero que porcion de cada una de estas explicaciones concurre en el dependiente de productos psicoadictivos, es algo que no se sabe con seguridad.",

      "abstract": "Smak og lukt er sanser som reagerer på oppløste kjemiske stoffer fra mat og luft via hjernenervene. Fysiologiske aldringsprosesser innebærer cellulære og intercellulære endringer i de nevroner i sentralnervesystemet som mottar smak- og luktsignalene. Aldring medfører også en viss reduksjon i antall smaksløker i munnhulen og antall luktreseptorer i nesehulen. Kliniske undersøkelser viser at svikt i smak og lukt forekommer i økende grad med stigende alder, særlig hyppig etter 80-årsalderen, og lukt hyppigere enn smak. Aldringsavhengig tap av smak og lukt er vanskelig å skille fra effekter av sykdommer og medikamentbruk, noe som er særlig karakteristisk for eldre på institusjon. Den tydeligste effekten på smakssansen rammer surt, salt og umami. Eldre er ofte ikke selv oppmerksom på dette og risikerer derfor tap av appetitt og feilernæring, særlig i retning av øket bruk av salt. Svikt i luktesansen bidrar til smakstap og kan også medføre personlige og sosiale implikasjoner i form av substandard hygiene og dårlig inneluft. I tillegg er de nevrodegenerative prosessene som fører til svekket luktesans, en av del patologien ved utvikling av demens. Svikt i luktesansen kan derfor være et forvarsel om kognitiv svikt.",

      "title": "Exploring the Hidden Ethnobotanical Treasures for Treating or Managing Chronic Alcoholism",
      "abstract": "Alcohol is one of the most common beverages consumed in today's society. Its vast popularity at various levels makes it one of the highest causes of driving fatalities, especially in the United States. Reports and statistics state that over 65 million people are struggling with alcoholism disorder. Alcoholism is a medical, social and economic problems where treatment methods mostly include difficult and long-lasting psychotherapy and in some cases, quite controversial pharmacological approaches. No medicine can 'cure' alcohol use disorder, but some can help you to recover. They can make drinking less enjoyable so you don't want to do it as such; e.g., disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, etc. But there are various side effects of synthetic drugs such as excessive use of acamprosate may results in abdominal pain, confusion, and increase urination. Naltrexone results stomach cramping, anxiety, etc. Excessive use of disulfiram shows polyneuritis, hepatitis, acneiform eruption, etc. The developments of alcoholism remedies have medical, social, and economical significance. In view of the adverse behavioral effects of synthetic drugs, the development of low toxicity and high efficiency medicines derived from natural products exhibits expansive market prospects. A 24number of medicinal plants and pure natural compounds are reported to have preventive and therapeutic effect on alcoholism and alcohol dependency, but their constituents, efficacy, and mechanism of action are mostly unknown so far. The reduction of alcohol absorption from the gastrointestinal system appears to be a common feature among most of the plants. The aim of this book chapter is to provide an overview of effective natural products for the prevention and treatment of chronic alcohol-use disorder.",

      "abstract": "AbstractAt present, theophylline is used predominantly as sustained-release dosage forms. Since the mid-seventies many such products have been introduced and have found huge application for use with a dosage interval of 12 hr (‘twice-a-day’ preparations). Since 1983 theophylline has also been available as preparations that can be given with an interval of 24 hr (‘once-a-day’ preparations). The release of theophylline from sustained-release dosage forms can be influenced (either increased or decreased) by concomitant intake of food. Obviously, ultra-slow-releasing products are most vulnerable to food effects. With some preparations the composition of the meal, especially its fat content, determines the degree of the food effect. The effect of meal timing and content on once-a-day theophylline preparations must be known since rather large doses are ingested all at a single time. If food can alter the release of theophylline in an unexpected manner from ultra-slow preparations, drug effectiveness may be impaired if release is inhibited or toxicity might result if sudden release of drug occurs. Herein, information about food interaction with once-a-day theophylline preparations is reviewed as this topic is important both for clinicians as well as those concerned with chronopharmacologic investigations of such medications.Key Words: Once-a-day theophyllinemeal effectsmeal fat contentDilatrane A.P.®Theo-24®Theo-Dur®Uniphyl®Uniphyllin®",

      "title": "Influence of Time of Day in the Development of Physiological and Behavioral Drug Dependence in Mice",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a spiraling and debilitating condition that has severe social and economic consequences for the individual and society. Recently, much work has examined the relationship between drug addiction and the circadian timing system. The master circadian pacemaker directs a daily temporal rhythm throughout the brain and body including the consumption of alcohol. Many drugs, including alcohol, can have myriad effects at different times of day. Conversely, alcohol can alter circadian physiology at multiple levels within the system. Few studies, however, have examined the role that the timing of chronic drug exposure and withdrawal plays in the development and maintenance of drug addiction. Alcohol use, for example, follows a circadian pattern with consumption peaking in the early evening in non-dependent individuals and withdrawal likely occurring late at night. In the transition to dependence, however, craving and consumption expand earlier into the day. What consequences this altered timing of drug use plays in the physiological and psychological consequences of drug addiction remains to be seen. Herein, we specifically examine if: 1) controlling for time of day in alcohol exposure/withdrawal can alter the development of physical dependence, 2) the development of psychological dependence, and 3) if time of day can become a conditioned environmental cue that triggers craving and behavioral sensitization in an amphetamine model of addiction",

      "abstract": "A.Latar PendahuluanPada kehidupan remaja saat ini, merokok merupakan suatu pemandangan yang sangat tidak asing. Kebiasaan merokok dianggap dapat memberikan kenikmatan bagi perokok, namun di lain pihak dapat menimbulkan dampak buruk bagi perokok sendiri maupun orang-orang disekitarnya. Berbagai kandungan zat yang terdapat di dalam rokok memberikan dampak negatif pada tubuh penghisapnya. Sekarang ini kegiatan merokok juga banyak dilakukan oleh remaja yang biasanya dilakukan di depan orang lain, terutama dilakukan di depan kelompoknya karena mereka sangat tertatik kepada kelompok sebayanya atau dengan kata lain terikat dengan kelompoknya. Hal ini sebenarnya telah diketahui oleh remaja khususnya dan umumnya masyarakat dunia, bahwa merokok itu mengganggu kesehatan. Masalah rokok pada hakekatnya sudah menjadi masalah nasional,bahkan internasional. Pemerintah tentunya juga tidak tinggal diam atas fenomena banyaknya kebiasaan merokok pada kalangan masyarakat,khususnya kalangan remaja yang masih berstatus pelajar. Selain kebijakan-kebijakan pemerintah akan larangan merokok diberbagai tempat umum seperti rumah sakit, di kantor-kantor, lingkungan sekolahan, serta tempat umum lainnya tentunya pemerintah juga mengeluarkan peraturan yang sah seperti 3HUDWXUDQ 3HPHULQWDK 5, 1RPRU 7DKXQ WHQWDQJ ³3HQJDPDQDQ 5RNRN %DJL.HVHKDWDQ¥\\DQJGLNeluarkan resmi oleh Presiden. Masalah perilaku mengkonsumsi rokok tidak hanya terjadi pada kalangan remaja ataupun kalangan pelajar pada masyarakat kota metropolis saja, akan tetapi sehubungan dengan berbagai pengaruh dan perilaku remaja karena pergaulan, maka pemuda atau remaja bahkan pelajar di pedesaan saja juga telah banyak yang melakukan kegiatan merokok. Termasuk dalam hal ini para pelajar SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Dari kondisi itulah maka dalam penelitian ini akan mengangkat topik dan masalah penelitian tentang perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Penulis merasa tertarik untuk melaksanakan penelitian ini karena kehidupan remaja khususnya para pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar sebagian besar merokok. Bahkan tidak hanya dilingkungan Sekolahan tempat penelitian saja tetapi secara umum merebak keseluruh penjuru pelosok desa di sekitar tempat penelitian. Adapun rumusan masalah yang menjadi dasar penilitian mengenai perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar,yaitu; (1)Apa yang mendorong seorang pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar, memiliki perilaku merokok?(2)Apa dampak yang ditimbulkan",

      "abstract": "Drugs are surrounded by an aura of myths. They are associated with various cults, ideologies, social movements and – unfortunately – pathologies. Humanity has been familiar with psychoactive substances for time immemorial but the functions of these substances have changed over the years. This change has been increasingly dynamic of late. Within the last few decades not only has the model of drug taking changed but also young people’s attitudes towards the substances. Most noteworthy is the evolution that has taken place in the model of drug taking. Nowadays the practice is not limited, as it used to be, to narrow circles of recognisably pathological youngsters but has spread to pupils, students and young men and women who have completed their education and joined the work force, who treat some of the substances as a no less popular element of their daily lives than alcohol. This state of affairs has been brought about to a considerable extent by the changes which are taking place on the drug market itself and by the quantum change in attitudes towards psychoactive substances. The model of functioning of people who take drugs has also changed. Previously, drugs were not taken on an occasional basis but were part of a permanent drug culture. Those who took drugs formed tight-knitted communities. Now, however, young people often take drugs spontaneously, occasionally, almost on the spur of the moment, without being associated with any specific social margin. Youngsters’ enormous receptivity to soft drugs and the constant presence of marihuana in their cultural activities has “habituated” them to the problems of drug dependence and led them to feel that they can take drugs and still belong to the drug-free community.",

The case discusses the effects that anabolic steroid abuse can have upon manhood. The frequency of anabolic steroid misuse is increasing. The implications of this with respect to psychiatric illness and violent crime are discussed. It is well known that the use of anabolic steroids among young men, body builders in particular, is growing apace (Perry and Littlepage, 1992), and they may be aware of the risks of impurity and contamination. There is a wide range of anabolic steroids in use; they are often used in doses of greater than 1 mg/kg per day. As well as single use, the misuser may 'stack' (use more than one at a time) or 'pyramid' (use increasing doses of a given drug) the steroids (Kennedy, 1990). The physical and psychiatric effects of anabolic steroids are well known (Kashkin and Kleber, 1989; Brower, 1992; Pope and Katz, 1988). However, we describe a case with psychiatric symptoms, a violent outburst and a unique (?) physical sign.",

      "title": "On the duration of cannabis effects and the presence of THC in the body",
      "abstract": "When tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the most important psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, is present in sufficiently high concentrations it affects brain function. It is important to know the duration of this effect, both for medical and recreational use. New studies indicate that small amounts of cannabis remain present in the brain longer than previously assumed and accumulate with repeated intake. The possible consequences are currently unknown. To guide information-based cannabis choices, we call for further research. Cannabis use is increasing [1], as are the average THC levels in cannabis products [2]. The question of the duration of THC presence in the brain and the subsequent effects thus become more urgent. Long-term negative effects have been suggested to involve cognitive impairment, including memory, learning and impulse control [3]. Some studies indicate that this may have to do with functional or structural changes in the brain [4, 5]. However, most psychoactive effects of THC fade during the first hours after cannabis smoking and are mostly gone 6–8 hours after intake [6]. After occasional smoking of 30–50 mg, a common intake per day for recreational users [7], THC plasma concentrations fall from approximately 50–100 ng/ml at peak to approximately 0.5–2 ng/ml at distribution equilibrium 6–8 hours later [8-10]. Twenty-four hours after smoking, most users will have plasma levels below 1 ng/ml and below the detection limit of several analytical methods (often 0.5 ng/ml). This could give the impression that THC is no longer present in the body. However, with an ultrasensitive analytical method, THC plasma levels have been detected for 10–28 days after smoking of approximately 30 mg THC on 2 consecutive days in an experimental study [11]. That study estimated the terminal half-life (T½) of THC in 10 subjects to be 4.3 (2.6–12.6) days. Recent population pharmacokinetic studies have reported a mean T½ of THC from 21.5 hours to 3.5 days [10, 12, 13]. According to general pharmacokinetic principles, the THC plasma concentration after a period of 5 T½ will be 3% of the level at distribution equilibrium. Taken together, these findings suggest that THC may be present in low concentrations from 5 to 60 days. An important question is whether these very low THC levels, which are comparable with the human plasma levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide [14], will be interfering with the brain function through an impact on the endocannabinoid systems. Repeated smoking within this period would lead to accumulated THC levels and probably increase the risk of interference. The duration of the low-concentration period shows marked individual differences in naturalistic studies of frequent smokers [15-18] and in less frequent cannabis smokers [19]. The reason for this variation in T½ is currently unknown, but could be dependent upon analytical methodology or biopharmacological factors such as gender, age, body mass index, pattern of use and drug interactions. In our opinion, data on the fate of THC in the human body expressed as comprehensive information on its T½, and similar to that required for medicinal drugs, should be available also to all users of cannabis. No external funding was necessary for this work.

La que genera el tabaquismo no es sencilla, comprende multiples factores, que provocan en el individuo una severa afectacion que conlleva su perpetuacion en el consumo. Asi el tabaco provoca fundamentalmente dos tipos de dependencia: fisica o farmacologica y psicologica o psicocomportamental. No obstante, a las mismas se debe anadir el `habito o automatismo'; adquirido tras anos de consumo diario de mas de 20 cigarrillos de promedio. Por otro lado, el fumador inveterado asocia el consumo de tabaco con gran cantidad de estimulos, es el componente manual-oral del cigarrillo, al que ademas hay que sumar la dependencia social que genera el pitillo al constituir en muchas ocasiones el intermediario para comenzar una entrevista o mantener un conversacion. Por todo ello, el tratamiento del tabaquismo es un tema complejo que requiere ser abordado de una forma multifactorial. Considerandolo no unicamente como una adiccion fisica que requiere un tratamiento farmacologico, sino que ademas debe contemplar la realizacion de un tratamiento psicologico, ya sea individual o de grupo, que ayude al paciente a pasar de ser fumador a exfumador, aprendiendo a vivir sin tabaco. En este articulo hacemos una revision de las distintas terapias psicologicas utilizadas en la deshabituacion tabaquica.",

The ants did not adapt themselves to these side effects and developed dependence on nutmeg consumption. The effect of this spice vanished in 22 hours after weaning. All these findings are not divulgated, but must imperatively be known by users (every one, restaurateurs) and practitioners, for instance by writing them of the spice package.

      "abstract": "Tobacco has been used orally alone or in combination with other ingredients. In India tobacco is taken in several forms. Use of smokeless tobacco indeed represents a health concern of growing magnitude among these groups. As a consequence of its addictive qualities, the consumption of smokeless tobacco often becomes a lifelong habit with cumulative and deleterious effects on health. Smokeless tobacco has been advocated as a substitute for cigarette smoking. On the contrary, the use of smokeless tobacco is fraught with health risk and needs to be discouraged. Previous reports have described long term harmful effects of nicotine on various body parameters, little is known about acute effect of smokeless tobacco on cardiopulmonary parameters. Very few studies have been undertaken on the acute effect of use of Gutkha, a common form of smokeless tobacco in India on cardiopulmonary parameters of youngsters. Methods: Treadmill Exercise Testing & Pulmonary Function Tests were done before and after maximal exercise testing to assess cardiopulmonary efficiency in two groups’ viz., healthy sedentary controls and healthy gutkha chewers. Results: On studying the differences in cardiopulmonary efficiency in the two groups the resting heart rate was found to be statistically significantly higher in the study group and the delta heart rate was found to be statistically significantly lower among gutkha chewers. There was no significant difference seen in parameters like VO2 max, maximum oxygen pulse, MVV, VE max as an acute effect of gutkha chewing. Conclusion: In this study it appears that tobacco chewers are physically fit like controls, but after immediate tobacco chewing a lesser delta HR suggests a higher risk for cardiovascular mortality. Stopping tobacco chewing at this juncture can be helpful in reverting back the risk and parameters like resting HR, recovery HR, and delta HR can be used as prognostic assessment tools for any intervention therapy to stop gutkha chewing in asymptomatic individuals.",

However, as with all psychoactive substances, dependence, both psychological and physical, can occur. This is of the alcohol-barbiturate type, though of less severity. The incidence of dependence under both therapeutic and abuse circumstance is quantified and found to be very low. The social significance of this level of dependence is examined relative to both the overall reliance of society on pleasure-giving activities, and the puritan ethics still applicable to mental illnesses.

      "abstract": "Currently, there are over 100 legally available synthetic cannabimimetics (SCBs). Serious adverse effects and deaths have been related to use of these substances. Despite their known hazards, many of them are still not banned for use in Croatia and grow in popularity among drug users. We report the case of a young man who suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest and eventually died several hours after smoking herbal incense containing a sprayed mixture of SCBs and consuming alcohol. He had no history of health problems and the autopsy revealed no pathological findings. We discuss hazards related to herbal incense smoking and draw attention to the rise in a number of cases related to use of SCBs in our community.",

      "abstract": "One in seven Nigerians aged 15 to 64 had used illicit substances (other than tobacco and alcohol) in the past year, with significant numbers suffering from drug-related disorders. Cannabis, known as marijuana or Indian hemp, contains THC, which affects brain receptors. Short-term effects include mood swings, memory loss, and poor coordination, while regular use can lead to anxiety, depression, and respiratory problems. Nigeria has strict laws against cannabis use, with severe penalties for possession and distribution. Tobacco is widely used for its nicotine content. Short-term effects include high blood pressure and increased heart rate, while long-term use can lead to lung cancer and heart disease. Smoking is legal in Nigeria, but there are efforts to reduce tobacco usage through taxes and health campaigns. Khat, or miraa, contains cathinone, causing similar short-term effects as tobacco. Though illegal in Nigeria, it remains used in some Northern communities. Datura stramonium, or jimsonweed, contains harmful substances that can cause hallucinations. Its use is also illegal in Nigeria, its traditional medicine practices can be risky despite potential benefits. The purpose of this review is to develop a review of current research on toxic, narcotic, psychoactive plants and ecological risk assessment, as well as to point out deficiencies and to offer motivation for enhancing the research level in this field. Research on psychoactive plants is being conducted progressively, and significant progress has been made in the aspects of occurrence. Nevertheless, there are some areas for improvement and more research needs be carried on the selected plants as well as other plants in existence.",

      "title": "THE PERSISTENT GRIP OF CHEWING TOBACCO AND ITS HARMFUL EF-FECTS ON AN INDIVIDUAL – A REVIEW ARTICLE",
      "abstract": "A majority of individuals in India engage themselves in daily consumption despite the prominent warning labels on tobacco chewing products such as “Tobacco is injurious to health and tobacco kills”, “Tobacco causes painful death”, and “Tobacco users die younger”. Tobacco kills over 8 million people annually and is readily available at a meagre price in our country. Its nicotine content makes it a potent and highly addictive substance. Once an individual becomes hooked on nicotine, breaking free becomes a challenge due to the relentless grip of withdrawal symptoms and insatiable cravings. Tobacco has become a coping mechanism to help an individual navigate the stress, anxiety and emotional turmoil of life. This reliance bows to a psychological dependence that's hard to escape. Hence, the repeated and continued use of tobacco results in addiction. Its usage poses serious health risks, and there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco. From its origin in America to its global spread, tobacco’s legacy is complex and complicated. The modern-day challenges of regulations and health issues continue to evolve as society balances the interests of public health, economic considerations and an individual's freedom. In Ayurveda, Tobacco was first described as Tamakhu by Aacharya Yogratnakara in the 17th century. Combating this global threat is essential to save lives and improve public health. The need of the hour is to create awareness, which can help in decreasing the harmful effects of long-term consumption of tobacco.",

      "title": "Application of Umami Taste Stimulation to Remedy Hypogeusia Based on Reflex Salivation",
      "abstract": "Enjoying taste should be one of the greatest pleasures in human life. However, aging is sometimes associated with decreased taste sensitivity, also known as hypogeusia. The loss of taste not only affects quality of life, but can also cause weight loss and health problems in the elderly. Our recent study has shown that 37% of test subjects over 65 years of age exhibited hypogeusia. Further, whole saliva secretion, including minor salivary secretion, was significantly decreased in elderly patients with gustatory impairment, but was normal in all elderly subjects with normal taste thresholds. These data indicate that hyposalivation is closely related to hypogeusia. Moreover, clinical studies have shown that treatment of hyposalivation diminishes hypogeusia, indicating that salivation is essential to maintain normal taste function. However, many medications for relief of dry mouth, such as parasympathomimetic (cholinomimetic) drugs, have serious adverse effects. Palpitation, sweating, nausea, diarrhea and dizziness have all been observed in elderly patients taking parasympathomimetic drugs. To circumvent this problem, glutamate, which produces umami taste, was demonstrated to increase salivary secretion and thereby improve hypogeusia by enhancing the gustatory-salivary reflex. Our data suggests that umami is an effective tool for the relief of hypogeusia without the side effects of parasympathomimetic drugs.",

A person who abuses multiple drugs may have a more difficult time stopping drinking and a higher risk for relapse to alcohol use after treatment. Conversely, a person who successfully stops drinking may offset this achievement by substituting another drug for alcohol. Successful treatment must take into account both alcohol- and drug-related issues, with particular emphasis on assessment, motivation, treatment design, and outcome evaluation.",

Some problems can be directly related to the pharmacological effects of the drugs, but many are associated with the methods of drug administration and more specifically with self-injection. Some drug abusers inject subcutaneously (‘skin-popping’) and some do so intramuscularly, but the most favoured route is intravenous – because this delivers the whole dose, with no wastage, directly into the bloodstream, producing the maximum effect with minimum delay, although increasing the likelihood of a toxic overdose. Whatever complications ensue, their management and the ultimate prognosis is adversely affected by the poor general state of health of many of those who are severely dependent on drugs, resulting from poor social conditions, malnutrition and self-neglect.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse is one of the leading causes of loss of productivity, disease, and early death in the world. People typically start experimenting with drugs of abuse during adolescence, and about 20% of people who use drugs develop a substance abuse disorder. In general, drug use is more common in men than in women. However, when women use drugs, they are just as likely as men to develop a substance use disorder. Drugs of abuse induce euphoria, and the rewarding properties of drugs play an essential role in the early stages of drug use. After the development of dependence, cessation of drug use leads to somatic and affective withdrawal signs, which contributes to the maintenance of drug use. The intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) method can be used to measure the acute rewarding properties of drugs and the dysphoria associated with drug withdrawal. One of the main advantages of the ICSS method is that it provides a quantitative measure of the rewarding aspects of drug use and the aversive aspects of withdrawal. The ICSS method can be used to identify sex differences in the rewarding and aversive aspects of drug use.",

Seiring perkembangan zaman, olahraga tidak hanya sebagai sarana untuk pemeliharaan kesehatan manusia tetapi juga sebagai ajang kompetisi yang dapat mengharumkan nama bangsa dan negara. Orientasi untuk memperoleh kemenangan tidak mudah bagi seorang. Tantangan tersebut mendorong munculnya keinginan untuk memenangkan pertandingan secara instan, antara lain adanya isu tentang penggunaan doping. Penggunaan doping dalam aktivitas olahraga prestasi menjadi salah satu isu yang sedang hangat dibahas pada saat ini, karena menimbulkan kontroversi. Doping adalah penggunaan oleh peserta lomba, berupa bahan yang asing bagi organisme melalui jalan apa saja atau bahan fisiologis dalam jumlah yang abnormal atau diberikan melalui jalan yang abnormal, dengan tujuan meningatkan prestasi. Kesimpulan dari hasil penelitian ini adalah penggunaan doping lebih berasal dari aspek individu sendiri, tanpa adanya kesadaran dari individu pelaku olahraga. Penggunaan doping dapat memberikan efek negatif bagi penggunanya dan dapat menciderai fair play dalam olahraga. Jadi hendaknya para peserta lomba mengurangi atau memerangi penggunaan doping. Dalam proses mengurangi dan memerang penggunaan doping dalam olahraga maka dibentuk WADA (World Anti Doping Agency) dan LADI (Lembaga Anti Doping Indonesia). Proses mengurangi pengguna doping dapat dengan menanamkan nilai etika dalam olahraga dan tidak selalu menuntut kemenangan menjadi hal yang utama. Kata kunci : Efek, Doping, Olahraga",

Some have argued that continued caffeine use is an attempt to suppress low grade withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness and lethargy. In some moderate users, this is possible; however, in experimental contexts, the phenomenon is too inconsistent to constitute a reliably valid syndrome.",

      "abstract": "One hundred fifty-eight users of eight or more different prescription drugs in a three-month period were identified, using computerstored pharmacy data. Compared with 99 \"light\" users of only one or two different drugs, these heavy users were more likely to be older, female, and white and to have blue collar occupations, if male, or to be housewives, if female. Heavy drug use was associated with greater use of other medical care and was usually a persistent characteristic. Prepayment for drug prescriptions was not associated with heavy use. Among heavy users were found some severely ill individuals, and some with emotional problems that appear to contribute to symptoms and requests for drugs. In a 21-month period, adverse drug reactions were experienced by 28% of heavy users as compared with 8% of light users.",

      "title": "The Nontherapeutic Use of Psychotherapeutic Drugs among the College Age Group: The Sedatives and Tranquilizers",
      "abstract": "Abstract The sedatives and minor tranquilizers comprise two large groups of prescription drugs widely used without medical supervision by the college age group. Within the sedative group, the barbiturates and methaqualone are currently the most popular. An estimated nine million Americans have used sedatives without medical supervision, approximately five and one-half million of whom are within the college age group. The appeal of barbiturates to college students is that these drugs produce a “high” similar to that of alcohol, relieve feelings of stress, and produce a temporary sense of well-being. Tolerance and dependence develop quickly; high doses impair motor coordination and judgment. Barbiturates are frequently implicated in auto accidents and in suicides. Methaqualone continues to be popular among students because of its purported aphrodisiac effects and because it is frequently used to bring the cocaine user “down.” Its increase in use has therefore paralleled the increase in use of cocaine. The use of tranquilizers has doubled between 1972 and 1982. Valium, the most popular of tranquilizers, continues to be widely used among students because of its ability to be absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream and to produce its effects of euphoria and acute intoxication quickly. Though Valium is considered to be a relatively safe drug, it can be fatal if taken in large doses with alcohol. Tolerance and both psychological dependence and physiological addiction may occur and cause students to use increasing doses of the drug. A detailed knowledge of the adverse psychological and biological effects of the sedatives and tranquilizers will prove helpful to all those working within the college health facilities.",

      "title": "S2864 Pill-Induced Esophagitis Secondary to Caffeine Pills",
      "abstract": "Introduction: In the United States, over 80% of Americans report using caffeine daily. Amongst the military population, caffeine use for its stimulant effects has been commonplace and even encouraged for decades. Studies have demonstrated that caffeine can counter the cognitive deficits seen with sleep deprivation, notably improving attention, vigilance, and reaction time. While caffeine is overall very safe, ingestion of high doses typically in the form of caffeine pills can result in deleterious side effects. Although the primary concern is development of cardiac arrhythmias, damage to the esophageal mucosa is a rare yet clinically significant occurrence. We present a case of severe pill esophagitis in a 19-year-old active-duty military member. Case Description/Methods: A 19-year-old man presented with headache, abdominal pain, and nausea following a suicide attempt with consumption of ∼7,300mg of caffeine. Medical history was unremarkable and he denied any daily medications or supplements. Vital signs and electrocardiogram were normal. Physical exam was significant for a holosystolic murmur and mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. Labs were significant for hypokalemia, and an elevated creatine kinase of 4,103 U/L. Acetaminophen level and urine drug screen were negative. On hospital-day 3 the patient developed worsening epigastric pain and decreased appetite. Computed topography imaging showed circumferential esophageal wall thickening concerning for esophagitis. Gastroenterology was consulted and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed showing severe Los Angeles (LA) Class D erosive damage extending from the gastro-esophageal junction to the proximal esophagus (Figure 1). Pathology findings were consistent with pill-induced esophagitis and the patient showed clinical improvement after treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Discussion: Caffeine has been widely researched as a stimulant and there is no evidence to support any adverse health effects when consumed in moderation (up to 400mg/day). Although dangerous levels are not well established, ingestion of >10 g/day is generally considered a toxic dose. Fatality from caffeine is rare with the most common cause of death being ventricular fibrillation. If consumed in pill form as is common in the military and shift work populations, it is important to realize the potential risk of pill-induced esophagitis. If encountered, this should be managed with a PPI until symptom resolution.Figure 1.: A: Esophagitis in the mid esophagus. B: LA Class D esophagitis at the gastroesophageal junction.",

Constatou-se que o acesso a serviços odontológicos por este público é dificultado, e ainda há muitos cirurgiões-dentistas que não detêm o conhecimento necessário sobre esta problemática, o que acaba por retardar o diagnóstico e dificulta o tratamento. Assim, é essencial a inserção dos profissionais de odontologia aos programas de saúde bucal direcionado aos usuários de drogas ilícitas, a fim de garantir uma atenção multidisciplinar e possibilitar uma terapêutica eficaz.

Frequent cannabis use, especially when first used before the age of 16 years, is associated with addiction, poor mental health, impaired memory and learning, reduced educational attainment, in addition to social and legal difficulties. Despite the harms associated with cannabis use, dependent cannabis users are less likely to present for treatment than other illicit drug users and problematic cannabis use is rarely detected by health professionals. It is important that clinicians regularly include screening and assessment of cannabis use and account for cannabis use in case formulations.

      "title": "Abstract CN02-03: Quitting or switching? Health benefits and risk of electronic cigarettes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although the best way for smokers to avoid the health risks associated with smoking is to quit smoking altogether, for those who do continue to smoke the application of an exposure reduction (“harm reduction”) strategy could result in substantial reductions in mortality and morbidity. Many smokers are concerned about the health effects of smoking and might be interested in trying new products if they believed this would reduce their health risk. The concept of exposure reduction is based on the principle that if dangerous behavior, like smoking, is likely to continue, the harm caused should be minimized. One such approach for continuing smokers would be to promote the substitution of alternative, less toxic means of delivering nicotine, assuming that these were proven to be less hazardous than tobacco smoking and did not cause any additional health risks. Electronic nicotine inhalers, commonly called electronic cigarettes or “e-cigarettes”, represent a new stage in which nicotine is delivered in a method that simulates smoking but without involving a tobacco combustion process. E-cigarette are battery-powered devices that provide inhaled doses of nicotine by delivering a vaporized liquid nicotine solution, usually including propylene glycol or glycerin. The nicotine is extracted from tobacco leaves (in the same way the pharmaceutical industry obtains nicotine for NRT production), and is then diluted and introduced into the e-cigarette's cartridge. In addition to delivering nicotine, the vapor also provides a flavor and physical sensation similar to that of inhaled tobacco smoke, although no tobacco or combustion is actually involved in its operation. When a user initiates inhalation into the device, air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the nicotine solution stored in the mouthpiece cartridge. It is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. On some models an LED on the opposite end of the device is activated during inhalation to serve as an indicator of use as well as simulating the glow of burning tobacco. E-cigarettes have been shown to reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms in abstinent smokers and, as nicotine is delivered without tobacco combustion, are thought to be substantially safer than cigarettes. While e-cigarette use is rapidly increasing, relatively little is known about their efficacy for smoking cessation, particularly compared with established nicotine-containing pharmacological aids. One randomized controlled trial by Bullen et al. showed that e-cigarettes are at least as effective as nicotine patches for smoking cessation. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of participants in this study engaged in harm reduction, becoming long-term e-cigarette users and reducing their conventional cigarette consumption. Thus, against the backdrop of ongoing debates on tighter regulation of e-cigarettes, a sole focus on smoking cessation may be misguided. From a public health perspective, the permanent switch from combustible to noncombustible products is an important endpoint in itself. Nonetheless, the finding that e-cigarettes are at least as effective as existing licensed, nicotine-containing smoking cessation products should go some way towards easing, if not completely allaying, the fears of many health professionals observing their fast uptake among smokers. Distributors of e-cigarettes promote the product as completely free of harmful substances. However, nicotine solutions used in e-cigarettes vary with respect to concentrations of toxicants, and the quality control in e cigarette manufacturing is questionable. Although a number of toxicants have been identified in e-cigarette vapors, the levels of these toxicants are orders of magnitude lower than those found in cigarette smoke, but higher than those found in Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products. Some studies suggest that vapor from e-cigarette is significantly less cytotoxic compared to tobacco smoke. One study found that after switching from tobacco to electronic cigarettes nicotine exposure is unchanged while exposure to selected toxicants is substantially reduced. Although it cannot be said that currently marketed e-cigarettes are safe, e-cigarette vapor is likely to be much less toxic than cigarette smoke. The devices likely pose less direct hazard to the individual smoker than tobacco cigarettes and might help smokers quit smoking or reduce harm by smoking fewer cigarettes. The use of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy among cigarette smokers who are unable to quit, warrants further studies. Further research is needed to evaluate long term effects of switching, including the health effects of continued use of e-cigarettes. Citation Format: Maciej Lukasz Goniewicz. Quitting or switching?

We also examine the biological effects of individual constituents in electronic cigarette aerosols, which include labeled ingredients, such as propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, nicotine, and flavorants, as well as unlabeled ingredients found in the aerosols, such as carbonyls and heavy metals. Lastly, we examine the effects of electronic cigarette use on endogenous metabolism via changes in cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can thereby impact therapeutic outcomes.

      "abstract": "Addicts are people who have learned how to give themselves a quick chemical fix or achieve an emotional high when they either want to or have to change how they feel, and when they want to ignore real-life problems. Most people do that, but the next morning, they feel sick or foolish. They don't do it again because it didn't work for them. What makes addicts different is that they are willing-or feel compelled-to do it again and again even though they know that doing so will get them into trouble.",

E-cigarette use is now widely recognized as a potential cause of acute lung injury. Vaping is often perceived by physicians as referring exclusively to the use of e-cigarette devices. However, inhalation of nicotine or tetrahydrocannabinol-containing aerosol through alternate methods such as \"dabbing\" and \"dripping\" are increasingly common. However, the health impact of these alternate methods remains poorly understood. The use of alternate methods and devices may go unrecognized because of lack of clinician familiarity with them. In this review, we discuss e-cigarettes devices, electronic-liquid components, the expanded spectrum of methods used to consume aerosolized substances, and the potential for lung injury.",

It is relatively easy to use insulin daily when the patient has the proper home facilities for sterilizing the insulin syringe. In several instances, however, it has been necessary to discontinue treatment because persons, such as traveling men, have been unable to sterilize their syringes when hotel facilities were poor, on railroad trains and, in one instance, during a protracted automobile tour. With this in mind the outfit described was designed to make possible the daily usage of insulin regardless of facilities for sterilizing the outfit.

In addition to the obviously anticipated clarification of normal values relating to erectile function and anatomy and refinement of examinations, tests, and procedures, there is still much to be discovered, refined, and defined. We can anticipate new medications being found to enhance penile erections. Maybe a pacemaker will be possible that will stimulate an erection. New methods will be developed to insert coils and scarring agents for veno-occlusive disorders. Drugs will be produced in the form of pills, creams, or injectables that will dilate, clean out, or prevent blockage in the arteries. Preventing erectile dysfunction should become the issue in the 1990s and the next century. Changes in life-style such as reducing stress, eating healthier, stopping smoking, exercising more, and reducing alcohol consumption will lead to better bodily functioning. Essentially, taking responsibility for our own well being will become important. Health promotion, instead of curing, will receive greater focus. Education will play an important part in realizing a goal of mature sexuality and improved general well-being.",

      "title": "Role of nicotine pharmacokinetics in nicotine addiction and nicotine replacement therapy: a review.",
      "abstract": "Smoking is a complex behaviour involving both pharmacological and psychological components. Nicotine is the main alkaloid found in tobacco, and is responsible for its addictive potential. Nicotine-positive effects on mood and cognition are strong reinforcements for smokers that contribute to their addiction, and cigarette smoking is particularly addictive because inhaled nicotine is absorbed through the pulmonary venous rather than the systemic venous system, and thus reaches the brain in 10-20 seconds. As the likelihood that a substance will be abused depends on the time between administration and central reinforcement, tobacco smoking can easily become addictive. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is available in different forms (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler, sublingual tablet and lozenge), and has been shown to relieve withdrawal symptoms and to double abstinence rates compared to placebo. Most NRT forms deliver nicotine more slowly than smoking, and the increase in nicotine blood levels is more gradual. Compared to tobacco smoking or even tobacco chewing, few positive (reinforcing) effects are obtained from NRT use. Nasal spray provides faster withdrawal relief than other NRT, but compared to smoking absorption is slower and nicotine blood levels obtained are lower than with smoking. These differences in pharmacokinetic profiles compared with smoking may explain that some smokers still have difficulties quitting smoking even when using NRT (apart from psychological and/or social factors). Combination therapy (e.g., patch+gum, patch+inhaler), higher dosage, temporary abstinence or smoking reduction (using NRT to reduce smoke intake) may be needed to help more smokers to quit.",

      "abstract": "Pusenje je nacin konzumiranja duhana uzimanog u obliku cigara (umotanih u duhanov list), cigareta (malenih cigara umotanih u papir), i pomocu lule. Drugi oblik konzumacije duhana je žvakanje i smrkanje. Nikotin u duhanu su tvari o kojima covjek može postati ovisan. To znaci da se tijelo navikava na uživanje tih tvari te pati bez njih. Poznato je da pusenje ugrožava zdravlje i izaziva ozbiljne bolesti. Na primjer, smatra se da je trecina svih slucajeva raka izravno povezana s pusenjem cigareta. Mnogi ljudi ipak zanemaruju ovu pogibelj te nastavljaju pusiti. Smatra se da svaka popusena cigareta skracuje pusacev život za cetrnaest minuta. Vecina teskih pusaca umire od bolesti izazvanih pusenjem. Pusenje skodi i nepusacima kad borave u zadimljenu prostoru. Uvijek je bolje ostaviti pusenje nego nastaviti pusiti. Nakon prestanka pusenja pogibelj da se oboli od neke pusacke bolesti postupno se smanjuje (naravno, samo ako pusac nije vec obolio ), te nakon deset godina gotovo nestaje. Dvije najotrovnije tvari u duhanu su katran i nikotin. Zrak koji udisemo mora se procistiti prije no sto iziđe iz donjeg dijela pluca. To je svrha sluzi, ljepljive tekucine sto se zadržava u nosu i gornjim disnim putovima. Sluz kupi necistocu i bakterije, a tanke dlacice potiskuju sluz iz pluca k nosu i gornjim disnim putovima. Katran u duhanskomu dimu nadražuje disne putove, sužava ih te povecava lucenje sluzi i ometa rad plucnih dlacica. Stoga se sluz, necistoca i bakterije pocinju zadržavati u plucima. Uzrok je to onomu sto obicno zovemo pusacki kasalj, a to je zapravo znak bronhitisa (upale disnih putova). Pusaceva su pluca stoga podložnija zarazama. Devet desetina oboljelih od raka pluca su pusaci. Smatra se da je katran tvar koja je tomu uzrok. Nikotin djeluje na mozak i živcani sustav uopce. Možda je stoga upravo on ona tvar koja pricinja pusacu užitak pri pusenju. No on uzrokuje i to da se covjek navikao na pusenje puseci osjeca jadno i bolesno. Nikotin ubrzava kucanje srca i steže krvne žile, pospjesujuci nastanak bolesti srca i krvožilnoga sustava.",

In the transition from functional to dysfunctional use, the drug ceases to be a means to become an end in itself, and although this does not occur with the majority of users, the conclusion is that, even in functional use, the individual's relationship with their activity is essentially adaptive, and therefore cannot be considered healthy.",

      "abstract": "The review recalls the types of carcinogenic chemicals that are used in laboratories, as well as the types of cigarettes and nicotine for smokers, which are considered essential substances for cancer. Smokers are more likely to develop lung cancer, although lung cancer can also affect people who have never smoked. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time you smoke and the number of cigarettes you smoke. If you quit smoking, even after smoking for many years, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing lung cancer. Inhalation of carcinogenic lab materials or smoking causes lung cancer by damaging the cells lining the lungs. When you inhale cigarette smoke that is full of cancer-causing substances (carcinogens), changes in lung tissue begin almost immediately. At first, your body may be able to repair this damage. But with each repeated exposure, the normal cells that line your lungs are increasingly damaged. Over time, the damage causes cells to function abnormally and cancer may eventually develops. Many laboratories carry specific risks, including the risk of exposure to carcinogens, and preventing accidents in the laboratory requires high care and constant vigilance. Examples of risk factors include high voltages, pressures, high and low temperatures, corrosive and toxic chemicals, chemical fumes, radiation, fire and explosions, as well as biological hazards including infectious organisms and their toxins.",

Inevitable evils one bears with greater or less equanimity, but those forms of ill health that are plainly avoidable should be ruthlessly traced to their sources and eradicated. Hygienic crusades are all the more likely to be successful in America since we have recently experienced a great moral uprising against those deadly agents, adulterated foods and quack medicines. It isno longer respectable or safe for wholesale or retail purveyors of food and drink to substitute for them any poison their fancy dictates. The demand for articles that are at least what they claim or seem to be has at last become so loud and persistent that no government can afford to ignore it.

Tobacco is a second major cause of death in the world. Tobacco is consumed in the form of smoking viz cigarettes, cigars, beedis, hukkah etc. or as smokeless varieties that are chewed viz. Raw powdered tobacco, Misri (roasted and powdered tobacco), Gutkha, Zarda, Pan masala etc. In Ayurved, Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum Linn), named as Tamraparna has been stated as a Sthavaravisha that primarily affects the CNS and is a cardiac poison. It’s chemical constituent, Nicotine is highly toxic and addictive. The common symptoms manifested being gingivitis, painful and bleeding gums, blackening of gums, dental caries, loosening of teeth, yellowish discolouration of teeth, halitosis, stomatitis, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, oral lesions etc. which may further lead to oral carcinoma.

Smoking raises the blood‐pressure by vaso‐constriction, accelerates the heart and respiration, and increases intestinal movements. In excess, cerebral depression may occur, and, with the coexisting depression of the vaso‐motor centre, may lower the blood‐pressure to such an extent that collapse may be induced. 4. The amount of nicotine inhaled during smoking depends not so much on the tobacco smoked, as upon the form in which it is smoked. The greater the condensation area between the point of combustion and the entrance into the mouth, the more nicotine will be inhaled. 5. Arterial disease may result from prolonged tobacco smoking.",

The fact remains that psychedelic drugs were used for more than fifteen years by hundreds of psychiatrists who considered them relatively safe therapeutic agents. Psychedelic therapy for alcoholism is based on the assumption that one overwhelming experience sometimes changes the self-destructive drinking habits of a lifetime, and the hope that psychedelic drugs can consistently produce such an experience. The purpose of giving psychedelic drugs to the dying might be stated as reconciliation: reconciliation with one's past, one's family, and one's human limitations. In the 1960s Walter Pahnke, a Doctor of Divinity as well as a psychiatrist, carried out an experiment designed to investigate the potential of psychedelic drugs to facilitate mystical experience. Illicit psychedelic drug use is an underground spring that continues to feed the stream of interest in systematic, publicly controlled experimentation.",

This paper reports five cases of coffee toxicity with a single cup of coffee within the last weeks. Presentation of toxicity varied among patients and ranged from lethargy to hallucination, tremors, agitation, shortness of breath, and decreased level of consciousness. Surprisingly, all five patients consumed an unknown caffeinated beverage called Death Coffee within 12 weeks, demonstrating that a new and unknown beverage prevails in our region.",

With changing migrationpatterns, epidemiological and clinical outcomes may have changed. The aim of this article is to review current knowledge on pharmacological, epidemiological and clinical aspects of khat use. Khat use is still highly prevalent in the countries mentioned, and in African and Yemeniemigrant groups. Preclinical and clinical data confirm its addictivepotential as well as possible psychological, psychiatric and medical consequences related to stimulant use; however, existing epidemiological studies do not focus on the prevalence of problematic use or dependence. There are no indications of high prevalence of khat use in other cultural and ethnic groups. Data are lacking on possible increased psychotogenic risks when khat is used outside of the original cultural context. As with alcohol use in many countries, khat use can be considered as a lifestyle in some specific countries, covering the spectrum from nonproblematic use to problematic use and dependence. Khat dependence is associated with high morbidity and societal and economical costs.",

      "title": "Electronic Cigarettes and Oral Health",
      "abstract": "Novel nicotine products, particularly electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), have become increasingly popular over the past decade. E-cigarettes are sometimes regarded as a less harmful alternative to tobacco smoking, and there is some evidence of their potential role as a smoking cessation aid. However, there are concerns about their health consequences, particularly in users who are not tobacco smokers, and also when used long term. Given the mode of delivery of these products, there is potential for oral health consequences. Over the past few years, there have been an increasing number of studies conducted to explore their oral health effects. In vitro studies have reported a range of cellular effects, but these are much less pronounced than those resulting from exposure to tobacco smoke. Microbiological studies have indicated that e-cigarette users have a distinct microbiome, and there is some indication this may be more pathogenic compared to nonusers. Evidence of oral health effects from clinical trials is still limited, and most studies to date have been small in scale and usually cross-sectional in design. Epidemiological studies highlight concerns over oral dryness, irritation, and gingival diseases. Interpreting data from e-cigarette studies is challenging, given the different populations that have been investigated and the continual emergence of new products. Overall, studies reveal potential oral health harms, underscoring the importance of efforts to reduce use in nonsmokers. However, in smokers who are using e-cigarettes as an aid to help them quit, the benefits of quitting tobacco smoking may outweigh any negative oral health impacts of e-cigarette use, particularly in the short term. Future research is needed to understand the clinical significance of some of the biological changes observed by following different cohorts of users longitudinally in carefully designed clinical studies and pragmatic trials supported by high-quality in vitro studies.",

Quitting is possible, and almost half of smokers have quit for at least some time. Half of smokers quit eventually. People who quit decrease their rates of death and illness, including heart disease and cancer, even if they quit late in life. The benefits of quitting late in life are less than quitting when young. Helping patients quit typically involves helping them through many attempts (five to seven, on average). Because most relapses occur within three months of quitting, and half within the first two days, patients need follow up within days, not weeks, of starting treatment.\n\nIt is important to warn patients about what they are likely to experience when they try to quit.

The aim here was to compare lifestyle, health characteristics and alcoholism problems among young adult smokers, non-daily smokers and non-smokers.",

      "abstract": "This book about ecstacy users' lives is based on one of the biggest government-funded projects ever undertaken and gives voice to the chemical generation for the first time. In the UK, where the study was conducted, over fifty per cent of young people use drugs, a quarter of them regularly. The people in this book are ordinary, decent, family-loving people, with normal lives, normal problems and normal aspirations. Through their own words we hear how they first started using ecstasy, how they use it in different ways, why clubbing and raving are so important, how good sex is on ecstasy, how they chill out, how they come down, what problems they encountered and why they quit.This path-breaking book ends by trying to answer the questions on the lips of every member of the chemical generation: what are the long-term effects of ecstasy? Because we can't answer them, the authors claim, we are failing in our duty to our children: telling them not to take ecstasy is alienating and pointless.",

      "title": "Pengaruh merokok bagi remaja dan pergaulan sehari hari",
      "abstract": "Pada kehidupan remaja saat ini, merokok merupakan suatu pemandangan yang sangat tidak asing. Kebiasaan merokok dianggap dapat memberikan kenikmatan bagi perokok, namun di lain pihak dapat menimbulkan dampak buruk bagi perokok sendiri maupun orang-orang disekitarnya. Berbagai kandungan zat yang terdapat di dalam rokok memberikan dampak negatif pada tubuh penghisapnya. Sekarang ini kegiatan merokok juga banyak dilakukan oleh remaja yang biasanya dilakukan di depan orang lain, terutama dilakukan di depan kelompoknya karena mereka sangat tertatik kepada kelompok sebayanya atau dengan kata lain terikat dengan kelompoknya. Hal ini sebenarnya telah diketahui oleh remaja khususnya dan umumnya masyarakat dunia, bahwa merokok itu mengganggu kesehatan. Masalah rokok pada hakekatnya sudah menjadi masalah nasional,bahkan internasional. Pemerintah tentunya juga tidak tinggal diam atas fenomena banyaknya kebiasaan merokok pada kalangan masyarakat,khususnya kalangan remaja yang masih berstatus pelajar. Selain kebijakan-kebijakan pemerintah akan larangan merokok diberbagai tempat umum seperti rumah sakit, di kantor-kantor, lingkungan sekolahan, serta tempat umum lainnya tentunya pemerintah juga mengeluarkan peraturan yang sah seperti 3HUDWXUDQ 3HPHULQWDK 5, 1RPRU 7DKXQ WHQWDQJ ³3HQJDPDQDQ 5RNRN %DJL.HVHKDWDQ¥\\DQJGLNeluarkan resmi oleh Presiden. Masalah perilaku mengkonsumsi rokok tidak hanya terjadi pada kalangan remaja ataupun kalangan pelajar pada masyarakat kota metropolis saja, akan tetapi sehubungan dengan berbagai pengaruh dan perilaku remaja karena pergaulan, maka pemuda atau remaja bahkan pelajar di pedesaan saja juga telah banyak yang melakukan kegiatan merokok. Termasuk dalam hal ini para pelajar SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Dari kondisi itulah maka dalam penelitian ini akan mengangkat topik dan masalah penelitian tentang perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Penulis merasa tertarik untuk melaksanakan penelitian ini karena kehidupan remaja khususnya para pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar sebagian besar merokok. Bahkan tidak hanya dilingkungan Sekolahan tempat penelitian saja tetapi secara umum merebak keseluruh penjuru pelosok desa di sekitar tempat penelitian. Adapun rumusan masalah yang menjadi dasar penilitian mengenai perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar,yaitu; (1)Apa yang mendorong seorang pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar, memiliki perilaku merokok?(2)Apa dampak yang ditimbulkan",

Many people reduce substance use as they get older. Yet a substantial percentage drink at hazardous levels or use illegal drugs, over-the-counter medications, or prescription medications in ways that put them at risk for health and psychosocial problems. This review examines the epidemiological literature on substance use patterns, including age-associated changes, risk factors for the development of alcohol and drug use problems, and strategies for screening, assessment, and diagnosis. It also describes approaches to intervention across a range of problem severity, highlighting issues especially relevant to psychologists working with older adults.",

Some 59 of them had at some time used cocaine more than once a week for a period of some months, when as much as 30 \"lines\" of cocaine were used per day of cocaine use. A sub-group of 28 of the 59 were polydrug users who used opiates, these polydrug users used the largest quantities of cocaine, most often, during their heavy use period and reported most problems with cocaine use. They were also most likely to be unemployed or have low incomes. Nonetheless, both polydrug and heavy users had reduced their cocaine use to relatively low current levels. The implications of these findings for the nature of cocaine dependence and cocaine problems are discussed.",

Alcohol and substance (tobacco, cannabis, cocaine...) use prevalence during pregnancy remains under estimated. Some studies have reported the prevalence of alcohol or substance use in different countries worldwide but most of them were based on the mother's interview. Consumption of one or more psychoactive substances during pregnancy may have serious consequences on the pregnancy and on the child development. However, the type of consequences is still a matter of controversies. The reasons are diverse: different rating scales, potential interactions with environmental and genetic factors. Considering the negative consequences of drug use during pregnancy, preventive campaigns against the use of drugs during pregnancy are strongly recommended.",

      "abstract": "Youth around the world take up smoking and use tobacco products at high rates. Young people may not grasp the long-term consequences of tobacco use, although tobacco consumption and exposure has been shown to have significant negative health effects. Youth use a variety of tobacco products that are smoked, chewed, or sniffed, including machine-manufactured cigarettes, cigars, bidis, kreteks, sticks, and snuff. Prevention efforts have focused on countering those aspects that are believed to contribute to smoking uptake, such as tobacco industry advertising and promotion, and access to tobacco. There are many aspects of tobacco promotion through the media that have been more difficult to control, however, such as product placement within popular cinema movies. Once a youth has taken up tobacco, he or she is more likely than an adult to become addicted and should be offered treatment for tobacco cessation. Although there is not yet sufficient evidence to prove efficacy, the same treatments are suggested for youth as are recommended for adults, including nicotine replacement products. Given the severity of the tobacco epidemic worldwide and the devastating health effects on an individual and population basis, there are currently many efforts to curtail the tobacco problem, including the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It is through comprehensive and collaborative efforts such as this that the global hazard of tobacco is most likely to be overcome.",

Hoewel de verkoop van de meeste kwikhoudende producten is verboden, blijven kwikincidenten mogelijk als oude, kwikhoudende, producten breken en daarbij vloeibare kwik vrijkomt. Hierdoor hebben GGD-medewerkers medische milieukunde behoefte aan informatie over de blootstellingsbepaling, de gezondheidskundige advieswaarden en de opruimprocedure na kwikincidenten. Kwikzilver, zoals vloeibaar kwik ook wel wordt genoemd, heeft meer negatieve effecten op de gezondheid dan de meeste mensen vermoeden en is daardoor een onderschat probleem. Langdurige blootstelling aan lage concentraties kwikdamp kan leiden tot ernstige gezondheidseffecten. Mensen kunnen gedurende langere tijd aan kwikdamp blootgesteld worden als kwik binnenshuis achterblijft na breuk van een kwikhoudend product. Een kleine hoeveelheid kwik kan gemakkelijk achterblijven in de vloerbedekking of in een kier, hoewel het lijkt alsof alles is verwijderd. Het doel van deze richtlijn is GGD-medewerkers achtergrondinformatie te geven en een handvat te bieden bij het beoordelen van kwikincidenten. De richtlijn geeft de benodigde informatie voor een zorgvuldige risicoanalyse en geeft adviezen over te nemen maatregelen. Een stappenplan is ontwikkeld als hulpmiddel bij de behandeling van een kwikincident. Tevens worden de mogelijkheden besproken om kwikincidenten in het binnenmilieu te voorkomen door bijvoorbeeld voorlichting te geven of door het inwisselen van thermometers aan te bieden. In de bijlagen staan voorbeeldteksten voor voorlichtingsdoeleinden.",

      "abstract": "AbstractMedications against any dependence-inducing drug face a dilemma: if they are efficient, they will induce withdrawal symptoms and the patient is likely to stop taking his medication. Anti drug vaccines are irreversible, provide protection over years and need booster injections far beyond the critical phase of acute withdrawal symptoms. Interacting rather with the drug in the blood than with a receptor in the brain, the vaccines are in addition free of side effects due to central interaction. For drugs like nicotine interacting with different types of receptors in many organs, this is a further advantage. There are three reasons, that anti drug vaccines have first been developed against nicotine. Firstly, in most parts of the world 20- to 50% of the adult population smoke and any smoking cessation treatment will have an important impact on public health and be commercially a very attractive product. The second reason are the smokers themselves, which would like to quit in significant numbers and which have shown good compliance for any form of treatment. Thirdly, the quantities of cocaine or heroine taken by dependant persons are higher than the quantity of nicotine per cigarette, which makes an anti nicotine vaccine the easier vaccine project.Three anti nicotine vaccines are today in an advanced stage of clinical evaluation. We report here how those vaccines work, on the progress of the trials and future developments to expect. Results show that the efficiency of the vaccines is directly related to the antibody levels of the probates, a fact which will help to optimize further the vaccine effect. We expect the vaccines to appear on the market during a time window between 2009 and 2011.",

      "title": "Electronic Nicotine Delivery System: End to Smoking or Just a New Fancy Cigarette",
      "abstract": "Smoking and tobacco chewing are the predominant causes of oral cancer. Tobacco is the second-most widely consumed psychoactive substance. There are numerous ways to quit smoking, of which one is electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). E-cigarette use is a brand-new, global trend. E-cigarette is a battery-operated device that heats a liquid to create a vapor that the consumer inhales. Several countries have acknowledged that the first step toward electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) management is a precise classification of ENDS within the limits of current legislation. Countries have currently categorized ENDS into four generations. People's perceptions about tobacco products have altered recently as a consequence of the advertising of ENDS. The likelihood of starting to smoke cigarettes was four times higher in adolescents who used ENDS, and the probability of quitting was reduced and often prolonged in those who used ENDS. In addition, ENDS normalizes smoking-like actions including inhaling in and exhaling smoke. Adverse marketing via geographic locations and social media platforms, as well as nicotine's irreversible effects on growing adolescent and young adult brains that predispose individuals to addicted behaviors, may be responsible for their rising appeal among teenagers. Despite this, ENDS use has risen among young individuals who have never smoked and undoubtedly face more health risks than those who do not use ENDS. The oral cavity is the first to encounter ENDS in individuals and where it initially affects the human system. As a known contributor to cardiovascular diseases, neurological conditions, and cancers, nicotine seems to be a serious cause for concern. This review provides a concise summary of the research on the components, mode of action, applications, and effects of e-cigarettes on oral as well as systemic systems.",

Ya sea en casa, trabajando, en la calle o incluso en el patio, por lo que se observa cada vez más el uso de diferentes productos químicos. Algunas sustancias generan riesgo de salud pública. Los disruptores endocrinos son parte de estas sustancias, las cuales pueden alterar el sistema hormonal del organismo humano y generar su disfunción, lo que puede llegar a causar diferentes enfermedades relacionadas con la salud reproductiva de la mujer, además de trastornos en los hombres, trastornos metabólicos, enfermedades neurológicas, cáncer de tiroides o los trastornos cardiovasculares. Los efectos creados en el cuerpo son acumulados e irreversibles y pueden transferirse de generación a generación, sin probar la patología. En el presente artículo se indaga acerca de la contaminación en los medios acuáticos, haciendo hincapié en los productos de uso cotidiano con presencia de estos disruptores endocrinos en su contenido, como los distintos efectos causados a seres humanos y a la vida marina, por mencionar algunos: los bloqueadores solares en los cuales recientes estudios indican que podrían ser bioacumulativos, persistentes y tóxicos, también los fármacos, esto se debe a que en su mayoría presentan anillos aromáticos en su estructura. Por lo tanto, se cree que es importante tener una idea sobre estos disruptores endocrinos para buscar de esta forma la disminución de los contaminantes, así como su utilidad en productos de uso cotidiano.",

However, many people are unaware that a lack of hydration can impair their cognitive ability, which can be especially harmful to individuals enrolled in a university. College students are often overwhelmed by the chaos of homework and other obligations, causing them to spend little time reflecting on their health and well-being. Individuals may forget to eat or drink water on a daily basis, which can have negative consequences for both physical and mental health.

Despite educational and preventive measures, steroid use has increased. Controversy continues regarding the enhancement of athletic performance and the incidence of major side effects. Some investigators have suggested that the hazards of anabolic steroids may be overstated in the diseased population and are minimal or absent in healthy subjects. Yet, many questions are unanswered. Current data do not link life-threatening side effects with intermittent use of anabolic steroids. However, many concerns remain. Dangerous situations include use of anabolic steroids by adolescents, preadolescents, and persons with liver or heart disease and use of oral compounds in high doses for long periods. A coordinated team approach (with representatives from sports, medicine, advertising, and the pharmaceutical industry) is needed to determine the real risks of anabolic steroids to athletes who are considering their use.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use has increased considerably during the last 15 years. One of the major problems dealing with cannabis use is driving under the influence of drugs. With the exception of ethyl alcohol, the majority of the epidemiological studies have shown that cannabis is the most frequently detected substance in people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Experimental studies are therefore needed to assess cannabis effects on driving capability. Many studies indicate that cannabis impairs psychomotor performance. This impairment becomes obvious when high doses of cannabis are taken, when ethyl alcohol or other drugs are simultaneously ingested, or when sustained attention is needed. Moreover, cannabis effects are qualitatively different from those observed after ethyl alcohol consumption. In forensic practice, cannabis impairment of driving performance must be related to cannabinoids blood concentrations. To facilitate the interpretation of cannabinoids blood levels, several models were set up recently. These models must be further improved in order to fit in with all circumstances of cannabis use.",

      "abstract": "Drug testing is used by employers to detect drug use by employees or job candidates. It can identify recent use of alcohol, prescription drugs, and illicit drugs as a screening tool for potential health and safety and performance issues. Urine is the most commonly used sample for illicit drugs. It detects the use of a drug within the last few days and as such is evidence of recent use; but a positive test does not necessarily mean that the individual was impaired at the time of the test. Abstention from use for three days will often produce a negative test result. Analysis of hair provides a much longer window of detection, typically 1 to 3 months. Hence the likelihood of a falsely negative test using hair is very much less than with a urine test. Conversely, a negative hair test is a substantially stronger indicator of a non-drug user than a negative urine test. Oral fluid (saliva) is also easy to collect. Drugs remain in oral fluid for a similar time as in blood. The method is a good way of detecting current use and is more likely to reflect current impairment. It offers promise as a test in post-accident, for cause, and on-duty situations. Studies have shown that within the same industrial settings, hair testing can detect twice as many drug users as urine testing.",

      "title": "Weight Loss Nutritional Supplements",
      "abstract": "Obesity has reached what may be considered epidemic proportions in the United States, not only for adults but for children. Because of the medical implications and health care costs associated with obesity, as well as the negative social and psychological impacts, many individuals turn to nonprescription nutritional weight loss supplements hoping for a quick fix, and the weight loss industry has responded by offering a variety of products that generates billions of dollars each year in sales. Most nutritional weight loss supplements are purported to work by increasing energy expenditure, modulating carbohydrate or fat metabolism, increasing satiety, inducing diuresis, or blocking fat absorption. To review the literally hundreds of nutritional weight loss supplements available on the market today is well beyond the scope of this chapter. Therefore, several of the most commonly used supplements were selected for critical review, and practical recommendations are provided based on the findings of well controlled, randomized clinical trials that examined their efficacy. In most cases, the nutritional supplements reviewed either elicited no meaningful effect or resulted in changes in body weight and composition that are similar to what occurs through a restricted diet and exercise program. Although there is some evidence to suggest that herbal forms of ephedrine, such as ma huang, combined with caffeine or caffeine and aspirin (i.e., ECA stack) is effective for inducing moderate weight loss in overweight adults, because of the recent ban on ephedra manufacturers must now use ephedra-free ingredients, such as bitter orange, which do not appear to be as effective. The dietary fiber, glucomannan, also appears to hold some promise as a possible treatment for weight loss, but other related forms of dietary fiber, including guar gum and psyllium, are ineffective.",

A significant subset of the psychiatric patient population will use ENDS and may have concurrent cigarette usage. In the clinical case highlighted here, a patient with significant nicotine use is prescribed clozapine. He typically inhales vaporized nicotine solution, but during a chemical dependency treatment, he was provided cigarettes instead of ENDS to prevent him from consuming substances other than nicotine. Exposure to cigarette smoke led to clinically worsening psychotic symptoms that reversed when he was discharged from treatment, stopped cigarette use, and resumed ENDS use. However, his extremely high nicotine exposure then led to symptoms resembling an anxiety disorder, which resolved when ENDS use decreased. Psychiatrists must become familiar with patients' vaping and smoking habits and be alert to altered plasma drug levels in patients whose method of nicotine ingestion changes over time.",

      "abstract": "Drugs and crime are destroying America. There are over two million incarcerated young men and women (more than in the military). Almost all of their crimes are related to drug abuse beginning about 12 years of age. The epidemic of drug abuse at early ages is based on the failure of families, schools and the communication industry to immunize youths against the contagion of drug abuse and the related rage against our culture which created them. There is one drug abuse arrest every 20 seconds. The growing acceptance of marihuana seems counterproductive. Basically, people want to escape from the rage-creating trends of life. Alcohol and drugs, including marihuana, are easy, but ineffective, ways of doing so.A major overlooked question is “Why? What is our culture doing to make people, beginning in their early puberty, to want to “turn off” rather than eagerly engage in a productive life?” Even those who are well off? And what can we do about it?Before Birth",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the foremost cause of death in the United States and is a major health problem worldwide. Clearly, the best way to eliminate the risk of smoking-related diseases, is to quit smoking. Smoking cessation has immediate and long-term benefits and substantially reduces the risk of many smoking-related diseases. Unfortunately, quitting smoking is rarely easy. For those smokers who cannot or do not wish to quit, reduction in their total smoking may represent a potential health benefit. Reduction in total smoking can, theoretically, be achieved by: 1) reducing the number of cigarettes smoked daily; and/or 2) switching to a low tar/low nicotine cigarette. Smokers, however, tend to self-adjust nicotine to maintain relatively constant levels. Reduction in tar/nicotine content or number of cigarettes, therefore, may not produce health benefits. Smoking reduction with alternative nicotine delivery, however, may represent an alternative option for smokers who cannot, or do not, wish to quit.",

      "title": "E-cigarettes: promise or peril?",
      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-operated devices that produce a vapour consisting of nicotine (although some are nicotine-free), propylene glycol or glycerol, and flavourings.E-cigarettes were invented in 2003 in China and entered the United States and European markets in 2006 [1].Hence, it is obvious that no observational data on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes exist as yet.Data on the health consequences of chronic nicotine exposure is available from studies in prolonged users of nicotine replacement products [2].These data do not suggest that chronic nicotine exposure increases cardiopulmonary or cancer risk.Toxic and carcinogenic compounds may be found in e-cigarettes, but in trace amounts that are much lower than levels found in conventional cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not expose the user to most of the constituents of cigarette smoke at concentrations that are responsible for many of the tobacco-attributable diseases.Therefore, most experts believe that inhaling e-cigarette vapour is less harmful than inhaling cigarette smoke.The limited available evidence suggests a potential for e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool and/or an instrument for reducing conventional cigarette use (harm reduction concept) [3].During the past few years e-cigarettes have gained popularity, primarily among smokers who want to reduce the risk of smoking [4].The paper from Guillet S. et al. [5] adds some information about the perception and the use of ecigarettes.The authors performed a cross-sectional survey in 2013 among 300 students and instructors of the French school of military paramedical personnel using self-administered questionnaires.They found a prevalence of smoking among the 200 responders of 40%, which is higher than in the general French population.In tobacco smokers the observed e-cigarette lifetime use prevalence was 57% and was close to the 50% of smokers observed in the general population.However, the daily use prevalence was much lower, at 4% in the study population and 3% in the French population.The motivation for e-cigarette use in smokers was the intention to reduce tobacco consumption in 43% and to quit smoking in 8%.But almost half of the responders reported a decrease in tobacco consumption following e-cigarette initiation (average decrease of 5 to 10 cigarettes).Only about half of all respondents, smokers and nonsmokers, perceived e-cigarettes as being less harmful than tobacco.A 30-to 40-times higher number of adults (age ≥18 years) were surveyed in the US [6].This annual consumer-based web survey comprised 6 555 persons in 2010-2011 and 8 173 between 2012-2013.Among smokers, an increase in",

When food and drink are reduced to chemical terms, the pleasure is essentially absent.

      "title": "The Clinical Experience That Taught Me the Most",
      "abstract": "The clinical experience that has taught me the most began before I ever entered medical school and will continue every day for the rest of my life. At the beginning of medical school, I became ill and was diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Overnight my life changed. Before, I had been a full-time student. Suddenly I also became a full-time patient learning first hand the difficult lessons of living with a chronic disease. No textbook can teach someone what living a life with a chronic illness means. I quickly learned that many physicians don't fully understand the ramifications of the diseases they diagnose or the medications they prescribe. Instead of being able to go out to dinner with friends, I was forced to cook all my meals because of the severe dietary restrictions my condition required. Instead of sleeping in or staying out late, I had over 30 pills to take at set times throughout the day. And I became so embarrassed about my condition, and afraid of my frequent bowel movements, that I stopped socializing with my friends. Whereas I had always been energetic and enthusiastic, I now found myself constantly fatigued. The host of side effects from my medications left me feeling like I had not one but two or three diseases. Many times I became so upset and frustrated I could do nothing but cry. The day before the second semester began, I woke up blind. That episode began the hardest six months of my life: I had thrown a blood clot to my retinal artery. I was admitted to the hospital and found to have extensive refractory disease, a hemoglobin of 6.2, and ischemia of part of my small bowel. I spent two months in the hospital. In all, I had over thirty colonoscopies, endoscopies, scans and other imaging studies done, six blood transfusions, and a Groshong line. A three immunosuppressive drug regimen finally controlled the illness, but by that time I was losing my hair, unable to walk, not allowed to eat, receiving TPN, Cushingoid, and suffering multiple other side effects of various medications. I watched my physician parents age with worry and I myself became severely depressed. My life turned upside down, I had little hope that I would ever recover, and I could tell that my physicians were pessimistic as well. Throughout this time, the most popular phrase recited to me by physicians, nurses and visitors alike was, “You will be such a better doctor because you've gone through all of this.” I began to hate hearing those words. There is a humiliation that occurs when you become a patient, a humiliation that is beyond the scope of any essay to describe. I had been a healthy 23-year-old medical student, but now was trapped in bed wearing a diaper, unable even to go to the bathroom by myself. Doctors came in and out but never explained my condition or prognosis. I began to resent those who could simply leave the hospital at the end of the day and go on living their lives. Eventually, I did leave the hospital, and I began learning to live again. However, it took a longer time for me to recognize the value of my experience. This realization didn't come in one brilliant flash of insight, but rather in the accumulation of numerous smaller ones: seeing a blind man on a bus, or a young woman in a wheel chair, enabled me to empathize with these people in a way I could not prior to my illness. When I began working in the hospital, I took care of a 37-year-old man who was diagnosed with AML. He was a professional cyclist, who was married with two children, and had been completely healthy prior to his diagnosis. As the disease progressed and he became weaker and sicker, I saw the same depression and resentment in his eyes that I had felt. One afternoon I went to his room, sat down and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself telling him about my experiences with illness: how I had refused to talk to anyone for days because I had become so depressed; how embarrassed I had felt when I couldn't get to a bathroom fast enough and had an accident in bed; and how even now I sometimes think about myself prior to my illness and become saddened because I feel like I'll never be a “normal” person again. Then I told him something that, until then, hadn't really sunk in for me: I told him that the most important thing for him to always remember was that this disease did not define him. He was not a lab count, or a disease name, or a test result. He was a person. And this disease was only a part of him. Yes, it would change his life—and yes, it would change who he is. But he was far more than this illness; and the sooner he reminded himself of this, the sooner he could gain control over his life again. That was the moment when I myself realized how much I had learned; how, in a strange, twisted way, I had been blessed when I had become ill. Until that time, I had never truly known how strong I was or how lucky I was. And with that insight, I was given the ability to show others in similar situations the same thing about themselves. While not being a “clinical experience” in the traditional medical school sense, my experience as a patient—and as a person with a chronic illness—has taught me that every disease, every lab result, every imaging study is actually a real person with a real life. What we do as physicians is more than just making diagnoses or performing procedures. We change people's lives. That is why humanism and medicine must go hand in hand. My experiences may make me a better physician; they have certainly made me a better person. The Arnold P. Gold Foundation, Inc., is a public, not-for-profit organization founded in 1988 to nurture and emphasize in medical school and teaching hospital programs the medical profession's time-honored tradition of caring. The Foundation believes that compassion and respect are essential in the practice of medicine; that cooperative relationships between and among caregivers and patients increase trust and enhance the healing process; and that medical role-model practitioners who embody these values deserve support, encouragement, and recognition. The Foundation supports 26 diverse and innovative programs throughout the United States and in other countries that are designed to foster humanism in medicine. In 1999, the Foundation instituted the annual Humanism in Medicine Essay Contest as a way to encourage medical students to express themselves through reflection about their experiences. The theme for the 2001 Humanism in Medicine Essay Contest was “The Clinical Experience That Taught You the Most.” The Gold Foundation received 358 submissions from more than 110 allopathic and osteopathic medical schools. Winning essays and honorable mentions were selected by a distinguished panel of judges. Academic Medicine is pleased to publish the top three winning essays from the 2001 contest; the essay by the first-prize winner, Meenakshi Bewtra, appears below. The second- and third-place essays will appear in the October and November issues, respectively. The theme for the 2002 contest is “A Humanistic Role-model in My Medical Career.” Any student from an accredited medical school may enter. Cash prizes are awarded for winners of first ($1,000), second ($500), and third ($250) place and up to ten honorable mentions. The deadline for entries in 2002 is September 30. Winning essays will also be published on the Foundation's Web site: 〈www.humanism-in-medicine.org〉 and in the Foundation's DOC newsletter. Individual judges' names may also be found on the Foundation's Web site. For further information, please call The Arnold P. Gold Foundation at (201) 567-7999 or e-mail: 〈[email protected]〉.",

Se realizo un estudio con 80 pacientes que han tenido cancer de Laringe, se estudio su modo de vida, costumbres, antecedentes familiares, condiciones laborales, cuidados personales en la salud, con lo que se obtuvo que un 60% de los pacientes fumaba y/o tomaba alcohol, pero un 20% cocinaba dentro de su hogar con un artefacto que en Mexico se llama anafre, el cual permite calentar alimentos quemando madera o carbon en el interior de su hogar,  tambien el anafre permitecalentar el hogar en epoca de frio,  Un 15%  de pacientes que tenian condiciones laborales desfavorables e inseguras, inhalando toxicos, gases y humo, y un 5% de pacientes que tuvieron cancer de Laringe por herencia genetica u otras causas.

      "abstract": "Several trends have affected the current standards for medication dosing recommendations for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Empirical evidence that treatment can effect improvement across multiple domains of impairment has encouraged optimizing treatment throughout the day. For stimulants, the value of increasing the dose to improve effect has replaced former notions of minimizing exposure to medication by treating at the lowest dose demonstrating effect. Several new stimulant formulations control the rate of dose delivery to optimize effect for longer intervals than immediate-release medication. This avoids morbidity associated with improper dose sculpting, inherent ups and downs of effect, and poorer adherence to multiple daily doses of shorter-acting products. Dosing of the new nonstimulant agent atomoxetine (Strattera) is based primarily on weight. Atomoxetine appears to have a longer duration of action in children and adolescents, but in adults it requires twice-daily dosing to maintain effect across the day. Whereas its overall effect size is smaller than stimulant agents, there is no way to predict an individual's response in advance, and for some atomoxetine may be the optimal medication treatment. Some head-to-head comparison studies between long-acting stimulant preparations and atomoxetine, especially those focused on duration of effective action, are likely.",

      "abstract": "Penyalahgunaan obat terlarang merupakan masalah yang kompleks yang terjadi pada semua kalangan termasuk remaja/pelajar, yang disebabkandan dicetuskan oelh banyak hal. Data BNN menunjukkan banyaknya penyalahgunaan narkoba pada generasi milenial atau generasi muda yang angkanya terus meningkat. Kota Tegal merupakan salah satu wilayah di Jawa Tengah yang memiliki jumlah penduduk dengan rentang usia remaja yang cukup besar, yang sangat potensial untuk dapat dijadikan sebagai tempat peredaran narkoba. Badan Narkotika Nasional (BNN) menyatakan penyalahgunaan dan peredaran narkotika di masyarakat menunjukkan peningkatan dengan meluasnya korban akibat narkoba. Tingginya paparan narkotika pada remaja perlu mendapatkan perhatian adalah bahwa target utama pasar narkotika ini adalah para remaja. Kalangan remaja yang terpapar narkotika lebih rentan sebagai pengguna jangka panjang, karena mereka memiliki waktu yang cukup panjang dalam mengkonsumsi narkoba. Dampak penggunaan narkoba ternyata dapat menimbulkan masalah lain yang tidak kalah mengerikan, sehingga penanganan penyalahgunaan narkoba perlu mendapatkan pehatian yang serius. Penanganan yang bersifat promotif dan preventif perlu dikedepankan sebelum dilakukan tindakan represif. Melibatkan secara aktif remaja dalam upaya penanganan yang bersifat promotif dan preventif merupakan salah satu solusi untuk mengurangi penyebaran Narkoba di kalangan remaja.Tujuan dari dilaksanakannya pengabdian masyarakat di Kelurahan Debong Kulon ini adalah untuk meningkatkan peran dan partisipasi mitra (remaja) dalam kegiatan P4GN, meningkatkan pengetahuan remaja terkait kegiatan P4GN dan meningkatkan motivasi remaja dalam kegiatan P4GN. Sedangkan manfaat yang ingin dicapai dari kegiatan ini adalah mitra (remaja) dapat berpartisipasi aktif dalam kegiatan P4GN dan dapat termotivasi untuk teribat dalam kegiatan P4GN. Untuk mencapai tujuan kegiatan pengabdian masyarakat di Kelurahan Debong Kulon Kota Tegal, dilakukan melalui beberapa pendekatan, antara lain dengan Model Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), Model Community development, Persuasif dan Edukatif. Hasil yag dicapai dari pengabdian masyarakat ini adalah tersedianya boklet atau modul tentang P4GN yang dibuat oleh mitra sebagai media edukasi yang interaktif sehingga terjadi peningkatan pengetahuan dan motivasi dari mitra untuk membentuk konsep diri yang positif",

      "abstract": "Publisher Summary\r\nRounding off the “central eight” risk/need factors is substance abuse. Subsumed under substance abuse are alcohol misuse and the use of illegal drugs. Alcohol and other drug abuse are quite prevalent among offender populations, but their relationship to crime is moderate. The prevalence of alcohol abuse among offender samples is quite high, certainly much higher than that found in the general population. Offenders and victims also report a high incidence of drinking at the time of the offense. Treatments for alcohol abuse include a variety of interventions such as pharmacological treatment, cognitive-behavioral techniques, and alcoholics anonymous. This chapter discusses the community reinforcement approach to alcohol abuse. Unlike alcohol abuse, illegal drug abuse has a closer relationship to crime because of the illicit status of drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and so on. An addiction to any of these drugs places a person directly into contact with other criminals and, in many cases, may exert pressure to engage in other illegal activity in order to buy drugs. Some drugs directly initiate thoughts that lead to antisocial behavior. Substance abuse, undifferentiated from alcohol misuse, is a commonly found risk factor for crime among adults and young offenders. Treatment from a theoretical perspective includes offsetting the rewards associated with substance abuse involves altering many reinforcement contingencies.",

      "abstract": "Whilst energy drinks improve performance and feelings of alertness, recent articles suggest that energy drink consumption combined with alcohol may reduce perception of alcohol intoxication, or lead to increased alcohol or drug use. This review discusses the available scientific evidence on the effects of mixing energy drinks with alcohol.A literature search was performed using the keywords \"energy drink and Red Bull(®)\" and consulting Medline/Pubmed, PsycINFO, and Embase.There is little evidence that energy drinks antagonize the behavioral effects of alcohol, and there is no consistent evidence that energy drinks alter the perceived level of intoxication of people who mix energy drinks with alcohol. No clinically relevant cardiovascular or other adverse effects have been reported for healthy subjects combining energy drinks with alcohol, although there are no long-term investigations currently available. Finally, whilst several surveys have shown associations, there is no direct evidence that coadministration of energy drinks increases alcohol consumption, or initiates drug and alcohol dependence or abuse.Although some reports suggest that energy drinks lead to reduced awareness of intoxication and increased alcohol consumption, a review of the available literature shows that these views are not supported by direct or reliable scientific evidence. A personality with higher levels of risk-taking behavior may be the primary reason for increased alcohol and drug abuse per se.

      "title": "Is there a place for cutting‐down‐to‐stop in smoking cessation support?",
      "abstract": "Conflicting evidence on the relative efficacy of cutting-down-to-stop (CDTS) versus quitting smoking abruptly could suggest that CDTS does help people to stop smoking, but is favoured by people who find it more difficult to quit. Future research should investigate this, and ways to implement and maximize the effectiveness of CDTS. Historically, guidelines and health professionals have recommended people stop smoking abruptly by smoking as normal until a 'quit day'. However, approximately half of people reduce their smoking before quitting 1, 2. This may involve reducing before a specified quit day or reducing consumption while aiming to stop at an indeterminate point in the future. In this editorial, we use the term cutting-down-to-stop (CDTS) to include both approaches. For people who cannot or will not quit abruptly, providing a CDTS option could increase the likelihood that people attempt to quit and use aids to cessation, such as support or medication, so increasing their chances of success 3. However, even if offering CDTS alongside abrupt quitting draws more people into services, it could be damaging if it results in lower quit rates than stopping smoking abruptly. This is because people who would previously have attempted abrupt quitting may find CDTS more appealing, and choose the less effective option. Therefore, research has explored the relative efficacy of the two approaches, but conflicting results have hampered interpretation. US- 4 and UK-based 1 surveys have found that people who chose CDTS were less likely to stop smoking than people who chose to quit abruptly, and results from one large, rigorously conducted randomized trial are consonant. The Rapid Reduction Trial (RRT) tested the effectiveness of behavioural support for CDTS compared with abrupt quitting 5. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was used before and after the quit day in both trial arms. Both at 4 weeks and 6 months follow-up, abstinence was more likely in the abrupt arm. However, a Cochrane Review pooled 22 trials comparing CDTS with abrupt quitting, including RRT, and showed no evidence of a difference [risk ratio (RR) = 1.01, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.87–1.17] 6. These contrasting findings provide pointers for research and practice. RRT was the only trial in the Cochrane Review to find a statistically significant benefit of abrupt quitting 6. This may be due to the nicotine pre-loading (i.e. pre-quit NRT), which has been found to increase abstinence rates compared with not using NRT before quitting 7. Nicotine patch pre-loading seems more effective than pre-loading with fast-acting NRT (e.g. gum and lozenges), which may be due to the supranormal higher blood concentrations of nicotine observed 8. Although participants in the CDTS arm of RRT used both patches and fast-acting NRT, they also reduced their cigarette consumption by an average 69%, potentially undermining the effect of pre-loading by reducing nicotine concentrations. Surveys suggesting that abrupt quitting is superior to CDTS may have been subject to residual confounding. People who chose CDTS may have been more addicted, less motivated to quit or those who had struggled to quit previously; for example, those with mental health problems 9. This is supported by an analysis from RRT, which found that participants who favoured CDTS at baseline were significantly less likely to be abstinent 6 months later compared to those who favoured abrupt quitting, regardless of the trial arm to which they were randomized 5. Observational studies have not adjusted for all of these potential confounders 1, 4. Another factor that could be affecting the success of CDTS is the way people attempt to reduce their smoking. There is only one way to quit abruptly, but there are many ways to reduce 6; for example, by varying the duration of the reduction period and setting a quit date to work towards or not. Some of these approaches may be more successful than others. There is very little research examining the effectiveness of different methods, but there is some evidence that achieving greater reduction 10, 11, receiving behavioural support rather than self-help resources and using fast-acting NRT or varenicline as an aid may improve quit rates 6. Finally, retrospective recall in surveys of abrupt cessation versus CDTS may be biased. Quitting smoking is often a long process, made up of many different cessation attempts 12 and strategies 13, 14. Even if participants ultimately stop smoking their last cigarettes abruptly, they may have previously reduced their consumption. Looking back, they may not remember or consider reduction that occurred before their most recent, explicit decision to quit, although it may have contributed to their ability to initiate a quit attempt and their ultimate success 15. The evidence discussed above has aimed to establish whether abrupt quitting or CDTS is more likely to help someone who has already decided to quit smoking to stop successfully 1, 4-6. However, the data do not definitively tell us whether promoting CDTS undermines or promotes overall quit attempts and the uptake of evidence-based treatment. Evidence suggests that people do not view CDTS and abrupt quitting as mutually exclusive, and may switch between the two approaches after deciding to change their smoking behaviour 13, 14. Therefore, offering both strategies could increase access to evidence-based treatment. This may be particularly important if CDTS appeals to people who would not otherwise be motivated to quit, but whom evidence suggests could benefit from this approach 16. We suggest that clinicians provide treatment tailored to an individual's preference, willingness or perceived ability to CDTS or quit abruptly with the goal of increasing the percentage of people making quit attempts and using evidence-based support. Evidence suggests that providing behavioural support and using varenicline or fast-acting NRT while reducing may increase people's chances of quitting, and will not put people at a disadvantage when compared with quitting abruptly 6. Research should examine who chooses CDTS versus abrupt quitting, and how those choices are shaped by policy interventions. Based on the evidence presented in this editorial we hypothesize that particularly 'hard-to-reach populations' may prefer CDTS, and so trials and complementary qualitative assessments of their acceptability in these populations would be especially helpful.

      "title": "Health education and the smoking habit",
      "abstract": "THE effects on health of smoking are generally known in Britain. This knowledge is based on a great number of research projects carried out during the past few decades and needs no further elabora tion. Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk from a number of diseases, most of which are serious and even lethal. At tempts are constantly being made to eliminate this habit and stop people from smoking, which have so far met with very little success. This fact has attracted the attention of researchers. In trying to find out why these attempts have in most cases failed, the researchers have examined several factors: some believed that the answer lies in finding the difference between smokers and non- smokers ; some have looked at the reasons for starting to smoke; others have looked at the physiological aspects of smoking, and so on. In general, one can say that most research so far has con centrated on smoking, that is on the problem, whereas very little has been done to study the solution, or attempts to solve the problem, and why they have so often been failures. This paper is con cerned mainly with the various aspects of the solutions to the problem of smoking, and outlines several new ap proaches which, if followed up, could provide us with a better insight into some more successful solutions. In the first place a dis tinction is drawn between the prevention of an illness and of a behavioural habit. Ciga rette smoking is considered to be a habit, with most of the smokers in need of behavioural treatment. Pre vention, by means of health education, however, needs to concentrate on the non- smokers in the first place, and only secondly on smokers. Consequently the target population for health educa tion in smoking consists of the healthy population who as yet have not acquired this habit. The methods to be used are based on a Social Interven tion Model (SIM) which I have been developing, design ed to emphasise preventive aspects and concentrate on a positive approach, stressing the rights of the non-smoker instead of the duties of smokers. This new concep tualisation of the smoking problem will require health education of two kinds: those skilled in influencing social norms and using the societal approach; and those who have a recognised profes sional status and have the skills of helping individuals to give up this habit and who will be involved in behav ioural treatment on an indi vidual basis, under approp riate contractual arrange ments. In some cases the two categories may overlap. In summary, the paper stresses the consequences of such an approach for the health education services as well as the need for changes in research policy with greater emphasis on studies con cerned with various solutions instead of the problem of smoking; changes will be required in the conceptua lisation of the whole problem area, and in the evaluation of new methods and the training of a new type of health educator, be it a health educa tion officer or any other pro fessional active in this field.",

Material y metodo: estudio retrospectivo efectuado con base en la busqueda en la base de datos publicados de PubMed. Los terminos de busqueda fueron: fumar y trastorno bipolar. Se obtuvieron 18 articulos y ademas se busco en la lista de referencia de los articulos seleccionados para las referencias adicionales pertinentes. Resultados: existen altas tasas de prevalencia de consumo de tabaco en la poblacion con trastorno bipolar, lo que implica consecuencias pronosticas importantes al asociarse con consumo mas intenso, mayores riesgos suicidas y comorbilidades somaticas y psiquiatricas (trastorno por consumo de otras sustancias) y mayores dificultades para el abandono. Conclusiones: para la poblacion general existe una serie de tratamientos efectivos para dejar de fumar de la que tambien podrian beneficiarse los pacientes con trastorno bipolar. Se necesitan estudios controlados especificos para esta poblacion.",

      "abstract": "O crescente uso de cigarros eletrônicos, dispositivos que administram drogas como nicotina ou maconha, entre os jovens, tem se tornado uma preocupação de saúde pública. Dessa forma, foi conduzido um estudo de revisão da literatura para explorar a conexão entre o uso desses dispositivos e a incidência de infecções pulmonares. Os resultados mostram que os jovens entre 18 e 24 anos têm as taxas mais elevadas de consumo de cigarros eletrônicos. Além disso, o uso desses dispositivos pode levar a danos nos tecidos pulmonares, resultando em sintomas graves, como insuficiência respiratória. Portanto, é necessária a regulamentação eficaz dos cigarros eletrônicos para evitar o uso indiscriminado, especialmente entre os jovens. Adicionalmente, direcionar investimentos em pesquisa para entender melhor os efeitos a longo prazo da vaporização e desenvolver abordagens terapêuticas mais eficazes para as lesões pulmonares associadas ao uso de cigarros eletrônicos.",

      "abstract": "Rats given a choice between a 5% alcohol solution and water will dramatically increase alcohol preference on the days following experience with inescapable electric footshocks, compared with unshocked animals. Although, total alcohol preference did not differ during shock days, an interaction occurred between shock stress and alcohol preference. Rats that initially preferred alcohol decreased alcohol preference during shock days, whereas, rats that initially avoided alcohol increased alcohol preference during shock days. Therefore, the stress of inescapable electric footshock has bidirectional effects on alcohol preference. These bidirectional effects depend on the temporal dynamics of alcohol consumption in relation to the shock experience and the initial alcohol preference.",

      "abstract": "En el ultimo siglo se produce un incremento del uso de drogas asistiendo a problemas derivados y generados principalmente por el abuso de bebidas alcoholicas, medicamentos y cambios en el uso de drogas tradicionales dando como resultado a nueva concepcion del problema en torno al consumo. Este trabajo pretende lograr una aproximacion a las nuevas modalidades de consumo como lo son; el consumo por atracon, el policonsumo y la medicalizacion de la vida cotidiana. Definido el primero como una gran ingesta de alcohol en tiempos reducidos, “el binge drinking”, lo que trajo aparejado el surgimiento de fenomenos tales como la previa en Argentina o el botellon en Espana. Por otro lado a traves de la medicalizacion de la vida cotidiana se persigue farmacologicamente un bienestar perdiendose de vista como fin la curacion, asociandose al bienestar personal y performance socia. Las caracteristicas que adquiere el consumo de drogas en el contexto actual no son mas que definiciones de nueva pauta de consumo sobre sustancias existente a lo largo de la historia, convirtiendose en nuevos desafios para las disciplinas de la salud mental a la hora de abordar la problematica demandando la necesidad de generar nuevos modelos explicativos.\r\nPalabras clave\r\nDrogas Policonsumo Binge Medicalizacion\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nNEW FORMS OF CONSUMPTION In the last century, an increase in drug use has occurred due to problems rising mainly from alcohol and medicine abuse and changes in the use of traditional drugs. As a result, a new appreciation about the consumption problem has been gained. This work attempts to give a closer look to the new ways of consuming drugs, such as gorging, poly-consumption and daily medication intake. Gorging is defined as an excessive intake of alcohol in shorts periods of time, the “binge drinking”what brings about phenomena like “la previa” in Argentina or “el botellon” in Spain. About daily medication intake, it can be said that through it a feeling of personal and social well- being is pursued, leaving aside the purpose of healing. The characteristics acquired by drug consumption nowadays are just definitions of new consumption criteria about substances that existed throughout and which become a challenge for different disciplines and which demand the need of creating new descriptive models to handle this problem.\r\nKey words\r\nDrug Consumption Binge Medicalization",

      "title": "Behavioral and cognitive effects of smoking: Relationship to nicotine addiction",
      "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is an extremely complex process that involves biological, psychological, behavioral, and cultural factors. Three factors that influence smoking and that are influenced by smoking are performance, stress, and body weight. We know that if nicotine-addicted smokers are deprived of nicotine, attentional and cognitive abilities can be impaired, and such deficits can be reversed if the person smokes or is given nicotine. In nonsmokers and nondeprived smokers, nicotine enhances finger tapping, focused and sustained attention, recognition memory, and reasoning. Stress results in increased smoking, but there is little empirical evidence that smoking reduces stress. Stress reduction from smoking is likely the relief of withdrawal-induced negative mood that is experienced between cigarettes. Smokers weigh on average 3-4 kg less than nonsmokers, and the weight-gain seen after quitting smoking also averages 3-4 kg. Changes in eating and energy expenditure are responsible for the body weight changes seen during smoking cessation and relapse. We need to know the full range of conditions under which nicotine affects behavior. The mechanisms by which stress functions to maintain nicotine addiction are not well understood. We do not know what interventions are effective in addressing the stress experienced during smoking cessation. Because no effective interventions have been developed to prevent weight-gain after quitting, research should focus on the concern or perception of weight-gain. We need to understand how and why body weight concerns vary across gender, age, and ethnicity because of the implications for designing effective smoking-cessation programs.",

A minority of such chemicals are proven neurotoxins and are hazardous even in low concentration. Since the late 1960s concern has been expressed that working men exposed to low levels of solvents, for example painters using oil‐based products or white spirit, consistently develop varieties of psychological illness which in their severest form have been described as a ‘dementia’. An examination of the literature, however, suggests that whatever long‐term adverse effects solvents may have, they do not appear to be characteristic, in either presentation or course, of dementing illnesses.",

      "title": "Role of physical activity in regulating appetite and body fat",
      "abstract": "Abstract Recent articles in the press have questioned the role of physical activity in regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight. These articles can be confusing and misleading for the public. Yet this is a complex area and there is disagreement about the importance of physical activity even among academics. Uncertainty and misunderstanding in this area may be related to the heterogeneity of the term ‘physical activity’, which encompasses sporting pursuits with extremely high levels of energy expenditure over prolonged periods of time, as well as everyday tasks involving much lower levels of energy expenditure on an intermittent basis. This latter form of physical activity includes what has been termed ‘non‐exercise activity thermogenesis’. In the right circumstances, physical activity can make a major contribution to the maintenance of a healthy weight even in the absence of dietary control although a combination of the two is almost certain to be more effective. In the long‐term, evidence suggests that for most people exercise is likely to lead to only modest weight loss. This may be due to an insufficient amount of physical activity being performed together with compensatory changes in eating and exercise behaviours. This is hard to prove because energy intake and energy expenditure are difficult to quantify in free‐living situations. Individual differences in the way people respond to exercise due to both environmental ( e.g . social class, education level, income, eating and exercise behaviours of family and peers, weather) and genetic factors also contribute to uncertainty about the effectiveness of physical activity for weight control. Nevertheless, physical activity remains a vital component of a healthy lifestyle due to its positive influence on energy balance as well as its potential to reduce the risk of lifestyle‐related diseases.",

O alcool e uma substância que acompanha o ser humano desde os tempos mais remotos. Sempre associado a bons momentos e consumido livremente dentro dos lares, em festas e comemoracoes. Por ser uma droga licita, o alcool comeca a ser utilizado muito antes do que o indicado por orgaos de saude. Os incentivos para que ele seja consumido sao bastante atraentes para os jovens. Os resultados derivados desse uso abusivo poderao persistir durante toda a vida adulta, causando problemas fisiologicos e psicologicos. A familia de um dependente sofre as consequencias desse vicio juntamente com o alcoolatra. A degradacao familiar, a perda do emprego e as sequelas causadas nos filhos sao algumas das consequencias do uso abusivo do alcool. Dependentes se veem excluidos da sociedade e vao para as ruas, onde a alternativa de sustento se apresenta de varias maneiras. Politicas publicas aparecem como tentativas de repressao ao consumo indevido de bebidas alcoolicas. O objetivo geral da pesquisa foi mostrar as consequencias que o alcoolismo gera em todas as areas da vida do dependente. A metodologia utilizada foi a de abordagem bibliografica qualitativa-descritiva extraida de livros, artigos e revistas impressas e eletronicas voltadas para o tema em questao. Conclui-se que sao muitas as consequencias negativas do uso indevido e abusivo do alcool e que a exclusao social dos alcoolicos, causa implicacoes a comunidade como um todo.\r\nPalavras-Chave: alcool, dependencia, exclusao social, droga.",

There was a close relation between drinking of alcoholic beverage and blood pressure but this concerned with men who acquired the habit of drinking by the force of surroundings. Strong tea and coffee, too, had something to do with blood pressure but in this case the surroundings were out of question. 2. Blood pressure was apt to rise with men who took meals hastily but it bad nothing to do with women. 3. Those who were fond of excessively salty or fatty food often suffered from hypertension. 4. Those who were particular about their food were found in the greatest number among the group of extreme hypertension. 5. Hypertension was rarely found among those with constant poor appetite. 6. Hypertension seldom attacked those who had the following complaints: To fall ill occasionally, to be always out of order, to have severe mental fatigue, to feel fatigue every morning, etc. But hereditary weak constitution had nothing to do with hypertension. 7. The blood pressure rose when the time for sleeting was less than 4 hours. It also rose with those who were easily awakened from their sleep or could not enjoy a sound sleep. But it was difficult to find any immediate relations between the failure to sleep readily or to have regular hours for sleep and the blood pressure. 8. Many heavy smokers were found among hypertensives which shows that smoking is the cause of high blood pressure. 9. The blood pressure rose of women whose household operates less than 50 area of farms while in the household with over one hectares, men's pressure rose. This is because in the former case, the stress of labor falls on women while in the latter, men bear the burden. 10. The rate of grey hair and baldness was high with the group of hypertension irrespective of sex. The same was the case with the declining of memory.",

It plays a role in the etiology, and depending on the intensity and duration, it also has an influence on histology, stage and therapeutic outcome. Therefore, it is never too late to stop smoking. Tobacco smoke is so toxic, that there is no safe smoking modality. Filters, light cigarettes, pipes, water pipes, etc. are prohibitively harmful. In addition, the electronic nicotine delivery systems, besides promoting addiction, cause acute respiratory and cardiovascular effects. In addition, even though long-term consequences are yet to be known, cell proliferation and tumor progression have been identified. Tobacco control efforts should look at all these new products as its main threat.El tabaquismo es la principal causa de cáncer de pulmón. Participa en la etiología y, dependiendo de la intensidad y duración, influye en el tipo histológico, el estadio de la enfermedad y el efecto del tratamiento, por lo que nunca es tarde para dejar de fumar. La toxicidad del humo del tabaco es tan alta que no existe ninguna modalidad segura de tabaquismo. Los filtros, las diferentes variedades de cigarros light, los puros, pipas de agua, etc. son prohibitivamente dañinas. Inclusive los diferentes dispositivos electrónicos para la administración de nicotina, además de promocionar la adicción, tienen efectos respiratorios y cardiovasculares a corto plazo y, aunque aún es pronto para conocer sus consecuencias a largo plazo, se han identificado efectos en la proliferación celular y progresión tumoral. Por lo anterior, las campañas para el control del tabaquismo deben considerar estos productos como su principal amenaza.",

      "abstract": "Substance use is common among adolescents. Although substance use may be a manifestation of experimentation in adolescent development, it may have more serious implications. It may be an indicator of emotional disturbance, or may be associated with several other health risk behaviours in adolescence. Substance use may also progress to harmful levels that can have a significant impact on a young person's health. Health professionals are increasingly being exposed to teenagers who use alcohol and drugs. The following article aims to provide, based on clinical and research experience in a number of institutions in Melbourne, Australia, an overview of the epidemiology of adolescent drug use, a clinical approach to assess substance use in young people and the principles of management of drug use in adolescence.",

      "abstract": "People use herbal preparations (food supplements and herbal tea) with St John’s wort, amongst others to feel and sleep better. However, these herbal preparations can reduce the effect of medicines, or enhance their effect. These interactions can have serious health effects. Herbal preparations with St John’s wort, for example, reduce the effect of certain medicines prescribed for fungal or viral infections and for cancer (chemotherapy). The effect of certain consciousness-lowering agents, e.g. sedative medicines, and consciousness-stimulating agents, e.g. antidepressants, is actually enhanced. The use of herbal preparations with St John’s wort may also pose health risks when used alone and not in combination with medicines. For example, the skin can be damaged faster (sunburn) if people sit in the sun after using St John’s wort. Other effects such as dizziness, diarrhea and anxiety have also been reported after the use of herbal preparations containing St. John's wort. It is not known what effects occur after people use these herbal preparations for a long time. There is also insufficient information available to determine whether the use of St John’s wort during pregnancy is safe for the unborn child. Moreover, the composition of herbal preparations containing St John’s wort can vary greatly, and it is often not known what exactly is in it. This makes it difficult to estimate the effects of a product. RIVM draws these conclusions based on a risk assessment on behalf of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS). RIVM advises consumers to be cautious with the use of herbal preparations containing St John’s wort, and to not use these products in combination with medicines. RIVM advises VWS to draft legislation on the use of St John’s wort in herbal preparations.",

Two hundred sixty-six young males, some of whom were marihuana smokers, and some of whom used other drugs also, were interviewed about their levels of achievement and drug use. It was found that lowered levels of achievement were associated with higher rates of drug experience for both marihuana and other psychedelic drugs. Goal setting varied as a function of the decision to use drugs or not, rather than amount of drugs used. These two findings, taken together, suggest that observed lowered achievement is not the result primarily of a change in values, but of perhaps several factors which are discussed.",

Tobacco products that can be smoked include cigarettes (manufactured or hand-rolled), cigars and loose tobacco used in pipes and waterpipes.

Los tratamientos multicomponentes, que incorporan tres fases de intervención (preparación, abandono y mantenimiento), son considerados como el tratamiento de elección para el abordaje esta adicción.No obstante, las altas tasas de recaídas tras las intervenciones hacen que sea necesario incorporar estrategias más eficaces dentro de este tipo de programas para prevenir la vuelta al consumo. Para muchos autores, el craving es la causa de la mayoría de las recaídas. Las técnicas de exposición a pistas o señales consisten en la exposición controlada y repetida a estímulos o entornos asociados al uso de la sustancia, con el objetivo de reducir las respuestas de craving en estas situaciones. La Realidad Virtual ha mostrado su eficacia en el abordaje de diferentes trastornos como método de exposición. Es este artículo, se propone el uso de técnicas de exposición a través de entornos virtuales para la mejora del tratamiento del tabaquismo. Abstract Smoking is currently one of the biggest problems of public health.Multicomponent treatments, which incorporate three intervention stages (preparation, quitting, and maintenance), are considered the treatment of choice for this problem. However, the high rates of relapse after the intervention make it necessary to incorporate more effective relapse prevention strategies within this kind of programs. For many authors, craving is the cause of most cases of resuming consumption. Cue Exposure Treatment, CET, consist of controlled and repeated exposure to stimuli associated with substance use, in order to reduce craving associated with these situations. On the other hand, recent studies have shown that exposure through virtual settings seems to be a more efficient strategy to present cues than exposure using other procedures. In this paper, cue exposure treatment through virtual reality enviroments are proposed inorder to improve smoking cessation treatments.",

Kebiasaan merokok dianggap dapat memberikan kenikmatan bagi perokok, namun di lain pihak dapat menimbulkan dampak buruk bagi perokok sendiri maupun orang-orang disekitarnya. Berbagai kandungan zat yang terdapat di dalam rokok memberikan dampak negatif pada tubuh penghisapnya. Sekarang ini kegiatan merokok juga banyak dilakukan oleh remaja yang biasanya dilakukan di depan orang lain, terutama dilakukan di depan kelompoknya karena mereka sangat tertatik kepada kelompok sebayanya atau dengan kata lain terikat dengan kelompoknya. Hal ini sebenarnya telah diketahui oleh remaja khususnya dan umumnya masyarakat dunia, bahwa merokok itu mengganggu kesehatan. Masalah rokok pada hakekatnya sudah menjadi masalah nasional,bahkan internasional. Pemerintah tentunya juga tidak tinggal diam atas fenomena banyaknya kebiasaan merokok pada kalangan masyarakat,khususnya kalangan remaja yang masih berstatus pelajar. Selain kebijakan-kebijakan pemerintah akan larangan merokok diberbagai tempat umum seperti rumah sakit, di kantor-kantor, lingkungan sekolahan, serta tempat umum lainnya tentunya pemerintah juga mengeluarkan peraturan yang sah seperti 3HUDWXUDQ 3HPHULQWDK 5, 1RPRU 7DKXQ WHQWDQJ ³3HQJDPDQDQ 5RNRN %DJL.HVHKDWDQ¥\\DQJGLNeluarkan resmi oleh Presiden.

Termasuk dalam hal ini para pelajar SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Dari kondisi itulah maka dalam penelitian ini akan mengangkat topik dan masalah penelitian tentang perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Penulis merasa tertarik untuk melaksanakan penelitian ini karena kehidupan remaja khususnya para pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar sebagian besar merokok.

Einen übergewichtigen Diabetiker zu motivieren, adäquat zu essen und das Gewicht möglichst schnell zu normalisieren, gelingt häufig trotz intensiver Unterstützung nicht. Die gleiche Erfahrung machen wir tagtäglich mit Suchtkranken: Trotz intensiver Motivierung zur Abstinenz gelingt die Abstinenz nicht oder nur partiell. Was hat zu diesem hohen und lange Zeit singulär bestehendem therapeutischem Zielanspruch der Abstinenz beigetragen? Hier können vielleicht die Entwicklung der Suchttherapie aus einer kirchlichen Tradition mit einer Anfälligkeit für Dogmen, die Erfahrung der Ohnmacht Betroffener und deren Einfluss auf therapeutische Ansätze in der Selbsthilfe oder auch die Funktion des Suchtkranken als Objekt von Phantasien und Neidprojektionen seitens der Gesellschaft oder der Therapeuten genannt werden. In keinem Bereich der psychischen Erkrankungen ist der Anteil von Betroffenen in spezifischer Behandlung so gering wie in der Sucht, bei Alkoholkranken wird nur jeder 10. von spezifischer Therapie erreicht. Hierzu mag das für viele Betroffene unattraktive Ziel der Abstinenz beigetragen haben. In der Forschung war und ist übrigens die Reduktion der Trinkmenge ein gängiger Zielparameter.",

      "title": "Debunking the Myth",
      "abstract": "“Wow — almost 2 h!” This was the response from my first-grade daughter as she finished adding up the number of minutes she had jogged to “burn off” the calories in a popular child meal combo from a large fast food chain. She was putting the final touches on her science project, which involved eating the meal, looking up the nutrition facts online, and completing multiple bouts of running (across several days) while wearing an activity tracking device. In line with my daughter’s reaction, I suspect that the average American has a highly skewed notion about the amount of activity required to negate all the calories he or she consumes. And the gross overestimation of the capacity of exercise to burn the extra calories we collectively consume is likely one of the culprits of the obesity epidemic we face today. The consequences of allowing the myth to be perpetuated have at least two major consequences for youth with obesity: 1) we set up a false expectation for these children and their families, who after exercising and failing to lose weight, may experience disappointment and decide to abandon exercise altogether; and 2) we create a potentially subversive and counterproductive scenario in which nonadherence to appropriate dietary modification might be rationalized by an individual who assumes that any extra calories consumed can be canceled out easily and quickly by exercising just a little more. Therefore, the benefits and limitations of exercise need to be accurately portrayed and placed into an appropriate context whenever physical activity counseling is offered to individuals with obesity. Exercise can aid in weight loss, just not nearly as much as most people think. In the current issue of the Journal, “Exercise for Obese Youth: Refocusing Attention from Weight Loss to Health Gains,” Shaibi et al. (3) expertly detail how exercise produces multiple beneficial health outcomes that are, unfortunately, too often deemphasized in favor of weight-based end points in many clinical trials. Indeed, exercise training can improve insulin resistance, beta-cell function, glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and vascular function, to name only a handful of benefits (3). One additional aspect of exercise and physical activity not fully appreciated is the role they play in weight loss maintenance. As described by investigators of the National Weight Control Registry study, physical activity appears to be indispensable in relation to preventing weight regain among adults (1,2). However, less is known about the role of physical activity on weight loss maintenance in children. Perhaps similar studies can be undertaken in children to improve our understanding regarding physical activity and weight loss maintenance and underscore their importance in the treatment schema. At some point, hopefully not far on the horizon, effective and sustainable nonsurgical treatments will be available for children and adolescents afflicted with obesity. And when that day arrives, exercise will continue to be an important part of the equation, particularly as the focus begins to shift toward maintaining a healthy body weight and addressing risk factors for other chronic diseases. In the interim, we as a research and health care community should continue to tout all of the health benefits of exercise, yet challenge the commonly held assumption about its role in weight loss (i.e., a little activity can go a long way toward burning off those extra calories). In so doing, we might cause some parents to think twice about pulling up to the fast food window so frequently and free up some time for their first grader who may be interested in doing things other than jogging for 2 h · d-1.

      "title": "Maintenance of long-term weight loss.",
      "abstract": "J. Graham Thomas, MS, and Rena R. Wing, PhD A key problem in the area of weight control is the maintenance of weight loss. Behavioral treatment programs are able to consistently produce weight losses of 7 – 10% of initial body weight at the end of 6 – 12 months of treatment. However, even with ongoing contact, clients often regain the weight, a finding documented by the Diabetes Prevention Program. 1 What makes weight loss maintenance so difficult? Physiological changes which occur during weight loss can promote weight regain; e.g., decreases in metabolic rate, increases in catecholamine excretion and thyroid function, increase in ghrelin, and increases in lipoprotein lipase activity. Psychological and behavior changes are also related to weight regain. People may become bored on restricted diets and more responsive to palatable foods and social cues that pressure them to eat more and exercise less. Finally, dieters’ motivation may decrease after an initial weight loss; clothes fit better, health may have improved, and the psychological effort or “costs” of adhering to a weight loss regimen may come to outweigh the benefits. Two approaches have been used to better understand the behavioral factors associated with weight loss maintenance and regain. One approach is to study those who have been successful at longterm weight loss maintenance. The other approach is to conduct randomized trials evaluating specific approaches to improve long-term weight loss. Both of these approaches are discussed below.",

      "abstract": "E-cigarettes are 95% less harmful to your health than normal cigarettes. When supported by a smoking cessation service, they help most smokers to quit tobacco altogether.\r\n\r\nKey messages:\r\n1. Smokers who have tried other methods of quitting without success could be encouraged to try e-cigarettes (EC) to stop smoking and stop smoking services should support smokers using EC to quit by offering them behavioural support. \r\n\r\n2. Encouraging smokers who cannot or do not want to stop smoking to switch to EC could help reduce smoking related disease, death and health inequalities. \r\n\r\n3. There is no evidence that EC are undermining the long-term decline in cigarette smoking among adults and youth, and may in fact be contributing to it. Despite some experimentation with EC among never smokers, EC are attracting very few people who have never smoked into regular EC use. \r\n\r\n4. Recent studies support the Cochrane Review findings that EC can help people to quit smoking and reduce their cigarette consumption. There is also evidence that EC can encourage quitting or cigarette consumption reduction even among those not intending to quit or rejecting other support. More research is needed in this area. \r\n\r\n5. When used as intended, EC pose no risk of nicotine poisoning to users, but e-liquids should be in ‘childproof' packaging. The accuracy of nicotine content labelling currently raises no major concerns. \r\n\r\n6. There has been an overall shift towards the inaccurate perception of EC being as harmful as cigarettes over the last year in contrast to the current expert estimate that using EC is around 95% safer than smoking. \r\n\r\n7. Whilst protecting non-smoking children and ensuring the products on the market are as safe and effective as possible are clearly important goals, new regulations currently planned should also maximise the public health opportunities of EC. \r\n\r\n8.

This group represented 25% of lapse-free abstainers. At one-year follow-up, long-term gum users were using an average of 6.8 pieces of gum per day. Long-term gum users were similar to treatment failures in cigarette consumption and tobacco dependence, while \"gum-free\" successes were significantly lighter and less-dependent smokers. Long-term gum users used more gum during the four weeks of treatment than treatment failures, who in turn used more than the gum-free successes. It is suggested that for many the long-term use of gum was an essential ingredient of their success. Long-term gum users gained significantly less weight than other long-term treatment successes.",

Modern researchers and scientists have fundamentally altered our way of life. However, pollution of air, water, body, and mind is also the result of science, with the advance of civilization mankind is getting weaker day by day. The fundamental changes in our lifestyle brought about by industrialization, changes in diet, physical activity, the nature of the job sitting hours together in front of the computer, roaming always in the vehicles, and lack of active exercise have paved the way to many diseases like diabetes, heart disease, obesity, etc. Routine health problems like constipation, uneasiness, gaseous distention, burning of eyes, sinusitis, headache, indigestion, etc. require a suitable treatment modality to overcome. Every day persons cannot consume medicines for these problems. The human body needs a kind of physical training to show its efficient results. These results are gained by practicing the so-called ‘Shatkarma’ which is able to bring good results if practiced forever. Body cleansing is gained through the practice of Shatkarmas or the six purificatory techniques. They are very important from the point of view of physical and mental health, and these simple techniques are also highly valuable in healing internal disorders which are the aim of writing this paper.",

Rokok sudah menjadi kebudayaan manusia (Jaya, 2009). Merokok adalah kebiasaan bodoh yang dapat membunuh diri sendiri dan tentu saja tidak ada yang bisa dipuji dari kebiasaan tersebut. Merokok membuat seseorang menjadi pucat, tampak tidak sehat dan keriput. Sesungguhnya seluruh perokok dewasa memulai kebiasaan mereka sejak usia remaja saat 2 mereka masih terlalu mudah untuk memikirkan konsekuensi jangka panjang dari merokok (Lovastatin, 2007). Perilaku merokok adalah aktivitas menghisap atau menghirup asap rokok dengan menggunakan pipa atau rokok yang dilakukan secara menetap dan terbentuk melalui empat tahap, yaitu: tahap preparation, initiation, becoming a smoker, dan maintenance of smoking (Maman, 2009). Jumlah konsumsi rokok di Indonesia menurut The Tobaco Atlas 2002, menempati pososi kelima di dunia yaitu sebesar 215 miliar batang.

      "abstract": "This article demonstrates that the endogenous desire to quit smoking can result from a rational consumption path chosen at the time the consumer begins smoking. This result is obtained without relying on hidden costs or unknown preferences. A finite‐lived agent chooses a path of consumption of a harmful and addictive good to maximize present discounted utility. The consumer chooses his consumption rate to account for the future health consequence of smoking and the withdrawal costs of quitting. A consumer may choose to smoke even if it means a lowered utility level for the majority of the time spent smoking.",

Se trabajo con grupos de jovenes. \nResultados: los jovenes dicen que el uso de cocaina ha crecido rapidamente en los ultimos anos. Las percepciones de los jovenes respecto de la droga son placenteras: estar bien, volar, aguantar toda la noche, impresion que con frecuencia es ignorada por los educadores. Muchos de los adolescentes normales tendran inevitablemente experiencias con la droga y esperan hacerlo con el minimo riesgo. \nConclusion: de este estudio se deduce que existe una proporcion de jovenes que estan en contacto con las drogas en edades cada vez mas tempranas, que una gran variedad de ellas tienen una gran accesibilidad tanto social como geografica y que los jovenes esperan un efecto placentero con un minimo dano.",

There were marked individual differences and these were consistent over 3-5 weeks. In itself, the pattern of smoking could be responsible for a threefold variation in smoke intake. Puffing but not inhalation became less intense as a cigarette was smoked. It was not possible to predict indices of absorption from smoking patterns. Certain smoking patterns, e.g. small puff volume, low puff frequency, short duration of inhalation and expulsion of volume between puff and inhalation, may be less harmful than others and this may explain why some individuals remain healthy despite a lifetime of smoking.",

Over the past decade its use has increased, with young adults/college aged individuals having the highest proportion of users compared to any other age group. Given the high rates of usage in this age group, cannabis use is an important aspect of mental and physical health in collegeaged adults. Current evidence indicates that marijuana use, especially early and dosedependent use, can have significant negative ramifications on general functioning, academic performance, psychiatric wellness, and may be causally related to development of other substance use disorders and risky behaviors. No strong evidence supports marijuana as a beneficial treatment for any psychiatric indication, however there is evidence supporting the use of cannabidiol (CBD) in illnesses such as epilepsy. Providers must be well apprised of the current evidence base for both detecting and treating marijuana use disorder given its increasing prevalence and decreasing perception of risk. Screening of cannabis use disorder and treatment with appropriate therapy is highly important for college mental health.",

      "title": "Hormesis",
      "abstract": "Hormesis is a concept of biphasic dose–response to different toxicological and pharmacological stimuli. According to this concept, a noxious agent at a small dose can exert a beneficial action. Among the known hormetic agents are pro-oxidants, heavy metals, heat, radiation, exercise, food restriction and different kinds of stress. All these agents are present in the environment so that the hormetic effect can be explained from the evolutionary viewpoint as living organisms have adapted to a certain level of the impact. For antibiotics, hormetic effects develop secondarily along with the positive selection of resistant microorganisms. Another example is that the adaptation of certain human populations to ethanol for over 1000 years apparently resulted in hormesis; moderate alcohol consumption was reported to be associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and other health benefits. However, the data on hormetic effects of ethanol originated mainly from more developed countries, that is, populations historically adapted to alcohol; and it is questionable whether hormetic effects would be pronounced in people with no historic experience of alcohol consumption. In the author’s opinion, hormesis as a general principle is conceivable only for the factors that are present in the environment, having induced adaptation of living organisms, so that a deviation in either direction from an optimum would be harmful. It is the case, for example, for light or atmospheric pressure, ionizing radiation as well as for many chemical substances and elements. There are no general grounds to expect hormetic dose–responses for factors absent in the natural environment. Discussed explanations for hormetic effects, for example, the homeostasis overshoot hypothesis assuming an excess of repair mechanisms in response to mild damage, or proposed existence of two different receptor types (small numbers of highaffinity receptors and large numbers of low-affinity receptors) appear to be neither sufficiently proven nor universal. Some reported hormetic effects can be questionable because of the difficulties of differentiation complex low-level hormetic responses from the placebo effect, suboptimal design of some studies and so on. Hormesis has been generalized and used, more or less directly, as a theoretic support for homeopathy. Homeopathy claims a curative reaction from a small dose of a drug, of which high doses cause symptoms similar to those from which the patient is suffering. Homeopathy originated in the vacuum of medical knowledge of the 19th century, prior to the acceptance of the germ and gene bases of disease; it was never grounded on empirical scientific evidence. Some publications generalizing hormesis can be cited in support of homeopathy and placebo treatments in gerontology and other fields of medicine, being suitable for endorsement of official registration of drugs and dietary supplements. Suggestions that homeopathy is based on hormesis create an illusion that homeopathy employs a scientific method. There is a well-founded opinion that without supporting evidence for the efficacy or purported mechanisms of homeopathy, the term hormesis should not be linked with it in any way. If homeopaths have useful empirical knowledge, it should be discussed in the professional literature and tested by scientific methods. In some works by Edward Calabrese, the concept of hormesis tends to be treated as a postulate. The question ‘‘Is hormesis likely to occur for all types of",

The patient is not aware that the tonic and his state of health are connected and as a result increases the dose of the tonic hoping for a remission of symptoms. This results in a worsening of the condition and admission to hospital. The arsenic levels in hair from such cases are much higher than normal and similar to those found in chronic arsenic poisoning from other sources. The symptoms are relatively mild and appear at arsenic levels significantly greater than those found in acute non-fatal poisoning where severe symptoms are reported.

      "abstract": "There have been recent reports of mass hospitalizations for alcohol intoxication following consumption of fruit-flavored, caffeinated, alcoholic drinks—especially concerning one brand in particular: Four Loko. Caffeine was quickly determined to be the culprit. In accordance with a directive by the Food and Drug Administration, caffeine was removed from Four Loko and similar beverages. However, the evidence that caffeine played a prominent role in widespread displays of intoxication is far from clear. Rather, it is likely that Four Loko-type drinks are especially effective as intoxicants because they provide alcohol in an unusual context. It has been known for many years that drug tolerance partially results from an association between drug-paired stimuli and the drug effect. When these stimuli are altered, the drug-experienced individual does not display the expected tolerant response to the drug—rather, an enhanced (i.e., nontolerant) response is seen. Four Loko and similar beverages may be especially effective intoxicants because they provide a very novel flavor context for alcohol. A recent announcement by the manufacturer of Four Loko suggests (either by design or happenstance) appreciation of the contribution of alcohol-associated cues to alcohol tolerance.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use and somatic consequences. Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance in the world. It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids.Complications somatiques du cannabis. Le cannabis reste la substance illicite la plus consommée dans le monde. La perception du cannabis comme une substance peu dangereuse au regard de son origine végétale participe à l’augmentation de son usage. La puissance du cannabis est définie par un ratio élevé entre les composants les plus importants du cannabis, c’est-à-dire letétrahydrocannabinol et le cannabidiol. Les effets aigus et chroniques de l’usage du cannabis comportent un risque majoré de troubles psychiatriques, mais aussi de complications cardiovasculaires, neurovasculaires et neurocognitives, respiratoires et de sevrage en cas de dépendance. Avec l’apparition récente des cannabinoïdes de synthèse qui sont des substances chimiques contrairement au cannabis issu de la plante, des complications plus sévères sont décrites même lors d’usage unique. Ces nouvelles substances de synthèse, bien qu’appelées aussi cannabis par les utilisateurs, ont conduit à une modification des prises en charge des usagers en raison d’une toxicité aiguë et chronique plus sévère.",

Performance was divided into four categories - sexual desire, sexual arousal, sexual satisfaction and orgasm.\r\n \r\nThe scientists looked at the effects the different drugs had on each category.\r\n \r\nThe study found that overall, the sexual performance of those using drugs was moderately to significantly impaired compared to those who did not use drugs.\r\n \r\nDifferent drugs had different effects on the various categories. For example, cocaine use did not usually affect sexual desire, but did affect sexual pleasure. Meanwhile, cocaine, heroin and alcohol all affected the ability to orgasm.\r\n \r\nWhen it came to sexual arousal, alcohol had the biggest detrimental affect. And this problem did not appear to resolve even if the men stopped drinking. This contradicts other studies which indicate that sexual performance returns to normal a few weeks after quitting drugs.",

Worldwide alcohol consumption has increased by many folds over the past decades. This urgently calls for intervention and relapse counteract measures. Modern pharmacological solutions induce complete alcohol self-restraint and prevent relapse, but they have many side effects. Natural products are most promising as they cause fewer adverse effects. Here we discuss in detail the medicinal plants used in various traditional/folklore medicine systems for targeting alcohol abuse. We also comprehensively describe preclinical and clinical studies done on some of these plants along with the possible mechanisms of action.",

Conclusion:When considering all of the results, nonfasting screening would not only be acceptable but also make physiologic sense.",

Alcohol can be consumed raw or by mixing in beverages, and whenever an alcoholic beverage is consumed, it can take about an hour for the body to metabolize one-eight of an imperial gallon. The level of the blood alcohol is increased when the quantity of alcohol consumed exceeds the normal dose which the body could metabolize, and then intoxication sets it. The higher the blood alcohol concentration, the higher the risk of diseases associated with the liver, kidney, and pancreas and the abundance of free radicals in the body system. Excessive use of alcohol can lead to alcoholism or alcohol dependence. Withdrawal from which can be life-threatening.

      "abstract": "El consum de tabac es entre dos i quatre vegades mes frequent en pacients amb patologia psiquiatrica. A mes, els pacients amb comorbiditat psiquiatrica fumen mes quantitat de tabac i tenen mes dependencia a la nicotina que la poblacio general. Aquest fet es tradueix amb un major cost per la salut i major cost economic. Tot i que en els darrers anys s’ha reduit la prevalenca de fumadors en els paisos mes desenvolupats, no s’ha observat aquesta reduccio en la poblacio psiquiatrica. Un dels factors clau pot ser l’ajornament sine die de l’abordatge del tabaquisme dels pacients amb psicopatologia per por a descompensacions psiquiatriques o a recaigudes en consum d’ altres toxics, encara que vulguin deixar de fumar. Aquest es un fet frequent en pacients amb dependencia de l’alcohol. D’altra banda, tot i que els pacients amb psicopatologia poden deixar de fumar, sovint l’exit dels tractaments es menor. Aixi, no queda clar quin es el paper que juguen els antecedents de depressio major i la simptomatologia depressiva present a l’ inici del tractament per abandonar el tabac. Tampoc es coneix si hi ha trets de la personalitat, segons el model de personalitat de Zuckerman, que dificultin l’abstinencia. Els objectius son: 1. Analitzar quin es el millor moment per a iniciar un tractament del tabaquisme en pacients amb dependencia de l’alcohol; el mateix moment que inicien tractament per a l’alcohol o sis mesos despres. 2. Avaluar l’ impacte dels antecedents de depressio major i de la simptomatologia depressiva, en l’abstinencia tabaquica. 3. Mesurar quins trets de personalitat, segons el model de Zuckerman, s’associen a major risc de dependencia nicotinica, major consum i risc de recaiguda. Les dades d’aquesta tesi venen de dos estudis diferents: el primer amb poblacio amb dependencia de l’alcohol i el segon amb poblacio general. En el primer estudi, un grup de pacients rep tractament estandard per l’alcohol i per deixar de fumar simultaniament o en diferit, primer per l’alcohol i sis mesos mes tard pel tabac. En el segon estudi, s’ avalua l’ impacte dels antecedents de depressio major, simptomatologia depressiva i trets de personalitat en els resultats d’una intervencio en tabaquisme. En tots els casos, la intervencio per deixar de fumar combina tractament cognitiu-conductual i farmacoterapia. Els resultats indiquen que els pacients amb dependencia de l’alcohol poden deixar de fumar i beure a la vegada sense que augmenti el risc de recaiguda en l’ alcohol, tampoc afecta a l’ adherencia, ni hi ha diferencies en la taxa d’ abstinencia del consum de tabac, comparat amb fer tractament per l’alcohol i despres pel tabac. D’altra banda, els antecedents de depressio major no disminueixen la probabilitat d’abstinencia de consum tabac. En canvi, la simptomatologia depressiva a l’ inici del tractament per deixar de fumar, si minva la probabilitat d’abstinencia. Per ultim, s’evidencia l’existencia de trets de personalitat diferencials segons el sexe, que impliquen major risc de dependencia i recaiguda. En homes, un baix nivell de sociabilitat es relaciona amb major nivells de dependencia, mentre que no es troben trets relacionats amb major dependencia en dones. Majors nivells d’impulsivitat i sociabilitat es relacionen amb major risc de recaiguda en homes i dones, respectivament. Aquesta tesi aporta dades a favor de la rellevancia d’identificar aspectes psicopatologics i de personalitat en pacients que inicien tractament per a la deshabituacio tabaquica. La identificacio de variables associades amb la recaiguda en el consum de tabac hauria de permetre orientar esforcos a minimitzar el seu efecte i millorar els resultats de les intervencions en tabaquisme.",

If unexpected death is defined as death occurring in an apparently healthy animal within a period of 12–24 h with no or minimal clinical signs, at least one study suggests that poisoning, accidental or purposeful, is the second leading cause of unexpected death in dogs. Toxicology testing is relatively simple and reasonably priced if people know what they want to test for. However, tests to identify unknown toxins, such as mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography, tend to be much more expensive. Postmortem toxicology can determine whether a substance, such as a drug, is present in tissue, but often cannot determine how much of the drug was given, since the post-mortem breakdown kinetics of most drugs are not known. Indications for common toxicology tests are listed for small animals and appropriate samples.",

      "title": "SHAREABLE RESOURCE",
      "abstract": "THE NOSE KNOWS. Having mild body odor, on occasion, is normal. Excessive body odor, however, can lead to several negative outcomes. For example, not only can it be a source of considerable discomfort for others, it also can be very embarrassing for the person who is experiencing this unpleasant occurrence. NOT THE WHOLE STORY. Although poor personal hygiene typically is the primary contributor to body odor, there can be other causes as well, including a nutrient deficiency, gastrointestinal problems, medical conditions, and the presence of certain toxins in the body. Individuals who do not change their clothes regularly or who smoke also are very likely to have a disagreeable body odor. UNWARRANTED BLAME. An unpleasant body odor and sweat seem to go hand-in-hand. Sweating does not cause body odor, however. In reality, sweat is almost totally odorless. Rather, the pungent smell is a byproduct of bacteria that are growing in and on the body — bacteria that thrive in a warm, moist environment, such as in the presence of sweat. MALODOROUS BREATH. In an attempt to neutralize any evidence of unwanted odors, people often brush their teeth or reach for a mint after eating well-known pungent foods, such as garlic, onions, and coffee. These efforts, unfortunately, often are in vain. In reality, aromatic foods can permeate the skin and subsequently trigger unwanted odors, which can persist for up to 24 hours. JUST LIKE A FINGERPRINT. Everyone has a distinct odor. Some scientists refer to it as a person’s odorprint. This odor type is determined, in part, by an individual’s genes. Odor type information is transmitted through body fluids, such as sweat and urine. This factor is why dogs can track fugitives on the run and why perfume may smell slightly different on one person than it does on another. THE SMELL OF AGE. It’s not clear why body odor may change as people age, but often it does. One plausible explanation for such an occurrence involves the fact that body odors originate from an interaction between the secretions of the body’s skin glands and bacteria that are present on the skin. As a person ages, the activity of different types of skin glands changes, thereby contributing to the possible existence of “old people’s smell.” UNDERARM UPHEAVAL. Certain areas of the body, including the underarms, contain a specific type of sweat gland (i.e., apocrine) that is responsible for a person having a problem with body odor. These glands, also known as scent glands, expel a secretion that subsequently breaks down, leading to the production of several substances, such as ammonia, which can cause offensive underarm odor. FLUSHING THE SYSTEM. The world is full of toxins. When toxins accumulate in the body over a long time, unwanted body odor can result. One of the best ways to remove these toxins is to exercise on a regular basis. When people exercise, they sweat, which helps to detoxify the body by expelling toxins through perspiration. THE THINKING-STINKING CONNECTION. Body odor can be more than a purely physical problem. In fact, mental factors can contribute to this issue, as well. Stress, anxiety, and depression, for example, can lead to unwanted body odor. In that regard, trying to achieve moments of peace and serenity can be a viable antidote for such a situation. HEALTH ALERT. Everyone has their own unique smell. Some types of body odor, however, may be an indication of the presence of certain health problems. For example, sweat that smells like bleach may be a sign of a liver or kidney disease. In turn, body odor that has a fruity smell may point to diabetes. Furthermore, fish-like body odor may be an inkling of a rare genetic disorder called trimethylaminuria.",

Currently, recreational use or peer modelling leads an individual to substance abuse. The magnitude of the problem of addiction increases multifold in the presence of stressors like broken families, joblessness, occupational stress, etc.The de-addiction process is used to relieve an individual's craving for the drug. It is a painful process, as several effects of withdrawal compel a person to return to the drugs again and again. Our aim is to explore the available literature on the use of Unani medicine for de-addiction.We surveyed various classical books from the available literature for drug de-addiction in Unani medicine. Indexed journals were also surveyed for the available related material using various keywords like \"opium addiction\" and \"Unani medicine and de-addiction \" and the information was filtered for this review.We observed that there was an elaborate scheme for de-addiction in opium addiction and the process is so general that it could serve as a framework for the de-addiction process for other similar drugs.Unani medicine is significant in the literature as being among the the available de-addiction addiction processes and may furnish several leads for various herbal drugs that may be used for de-addiction in the future.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is the most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. In just a few short years, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have become increasingly popular, especially for younger individuals. Many people believe that e-cigarettes are safe. The inhaled aerosols of e-cigarettes contain numerous potential toxicities, some of which could be dangerous for health with long-term use. The safety of prolonged aerosol exposure is not known. The use of e-cigarettes as a harm-reduction tool at stopping tobacco smoking is not uniformly successful. E-cigarettes may be safer than tobacco products, but repeated prolonged exposure to their aerosols has its own considerable potential risk. The long-term health consequences of their use remain to be established. Physicians should vigorously discourage the use of e-cigarettes and tobacco products, with special emphasis on abstinence for younger people and during pregnancy or lactation.",

Subsequently, there has been an increase in the amount of reports of nicotine intoxications. Acute nicotine intoxications have a biphasic clinical course, during which the initial symptoms may include agitation, tachycardia and vomiting. When large enough doses are used more serious symptoms may emerge.

However, helping the toddlers to give up the bottles at the proper age is necessary. It is recommended that babies should wean their bottles off before one year and a half. If they can’t stop the bottles, the adverse impact such as tooth decayed, malnutrition and lack of skill development may occur. The causes of bottle weaning include the factors associated with children themselves, parents’ behaviors and the aspect regarding time. Parents’ behaviors, for instance, feeding children at late night and giving them the milk every time they asked seem to be the important thing affecting the process of the bottle weaning off.

      "abstract": "Although drug use has been found to be acquired in a series of stages or steps, the exact nature of this progression has not been firmly established, nor has such a process been corroborated for life periods other than adolescence. In this study, drug use data obtained from 654 adolescents were used to examine changes and sequencing of drug involvement over an eight-year period from early adolescence to young adulthood. Cannabis use peaked during late adolescence; liquor, stimulants, and nonprescription medication increased steadily over the eight-year period; hypnotics and psychedelic use increased through late adolescence and remained stable through young adulthood; and early experimental use of cigarettes decreased to more committed use over the eight-year span. In a latent variable model that did not include nonprescription drugs and cigarettes, alcohol use significantly influenced later cannabis and hard drug use, whereas cannabis use predicted later hard drug use for the earlier life period. Only the cannabis effect remained at the older age period, when drug use patterns appeared to become more stable and firmly established. However, when cigarettes and nonprescription drugs were added to the model, quite different results emerged. Based on this more comprehensive analysis, it was concluded that: There are several interrelated mini-sequences of drug involvement; cigarettes play a prominent role as a gateway to cannabis and hard drugs; and at higher levels of involvement there is a synergistic or reciprocal effect of increasing involvement. Again, the later developmental period was much more stable with somewhat different patterns of influence.",

      "abstract": "Members of the UK population receive radiation doses from a number of sources including cosmic radiation, from uranium, thorium and their decay products, particularly radon, and from medical sources. On average, members of the UK population receive an effective dose of about 200 mSv over their lifetime. This results in a risk of fatal cancer of about 1%. However, the radiation dose is not the same to all individuals. Some components give doses that vary systematically from one region to another. Doses may also vary greatly from one individual to another. The rate at which the dose is accumulated may vary as the individual ages. Different organs and tissues do not necessarily receive the same dose. This paper discusses these factors and attempts to quantify them. Cosmic rays deliver doses which vary little across the body or between individuals. Terrestrial gamma rays also deliver more or less uniform whole-body doses, but the difference between individuals can be greater. Radionuclides in food deliver doses which vary both across the body and between individuals. These variations are even more marked in the case of doses from radon and from medical exposures.",

      "title": "Tobacco and smoking cessation",
      "abstract": "Background: Tobacco products have been used by human for a long history. The prevalence of tobacco use varies in different countries. Tobacco use is different from tobacco use disorder. Tobacco use disorder is a problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to significant distress or impairment. Cigarette smoking is a chronic relapsing substance use disorder caused by addiction to nicotine. Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 different chemical compounds, of which 93 of them are harmful substances. Methods: In this review, the authors intended to address the issues of harmful effects of cigarette smoking and how to cease smoking. Results: Abundant studies showed that tobacco use is the main risk factor of morbidity and mortality in the world. People who use tobacco products should be advised to quit smoking and offered appropriate treatment. It is better for health-care providers to make the smoking cessation treatment as a standard component of medical care. Data from evidence-based literature showed that smoking cessation therapy can significantly raise smoking cessation rates and should be routinely in persons who are willing to quit tobacco smoking. Smoking cessation treatment includes psychosocial interventions and pharmacological treatment, which may be used in combination. Nonpharmacological management may be individual or group sessions, and it may include motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and others. Delivery formats of stop-smoking interventions are varied. Pharmacological therapy includes nicotine replacement treatment and smoking aids such as bupropion and varenicline. Morbidity and mortality rates are decreased with tobacco cessation at any point in time, although cessation before the age of 40 years has the most significant effect. Conclusion: The Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act took effect since 1997 in Taiwan. Rates of Taiwanese tobacco use have been steadily declining. Brilliant achievements in the field of tobacco control in Taiwan draw international attention.",

The 16 subjects in the small study selected from a larger group of 99 adults with self-identified caffeine dependence clearly do not represent a cross section of the US population. Ten of the 16 had a previous substance abuse disorder (most commonly alcohol), two had a psychiatric diagnosis, and 14 of 16 were of the same sex. In addition, although subjects were not assessed for nicotine dependence, five were smokers who had a higher caffeine consumption than the nonsmokers. Obviously, caffeine consumption is markedly different from the use of drugs of abuse. For example, steadily increasing doses are generally not associated with caffeine ingestion and, of course, the destructive antisocial behavior provoked by drugs of abuse is clearly not associated with caffeine",

However, only a minority of American adults with high-risk alcohol use receive treatment. Three medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat alcohol use disorder: acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone. Acamprosate and naltrexone reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence rates, although the effects appear to be modest. Disulfiram has been used for years, but evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent. Other medications may be beneficial to reduce heavy alcohol use. The anticonvulsants topiramate and gabapentin may reduce alcohol ingestion, although long-term studies are lacking. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients without mood disorders, but sertraline and fluoxetine may help depressed patients decrease alcohol ingestion. Ondansetron may reduce alcohol use, particularly in selected subpopulations. Further study is needed for genetically targeted or as-needed medications to reduce alcohol use.",

In recent years, the discovery of receptor sites and endogenous cannabinoids has greatly increased our knowledge of the pharmacology of the drug and reinvigorated the search for medical applications. Modern instrumental techniques enable cannabinoids to be determined in biological specimens at significant concentrations. Maximum concentrations of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in blood are achieved within minutes of commencement of smoking but take 1‐5 h after oral ingestion. Excretion of cannabis metabolites may take up to 12 days after low‐to‐moderate use but up to 77 days after very heavy use. Cannabis abuse adversely affects many behavioral and physiological functions. Legislative efforts have failed to control the increase in cannabis abuse. Oral fluid has emerged as a useful sample for assessing recent cannabis use and may be particularly useful for the roadside testing of drivers.",

However, despite large numbers of campaigns and interventions, thousands of young Canadians continue to initiate cigarette smoking every year. The increasing popularity of alternative tobacco products and e-cigarettes is also creating new health challenges. Research has shown that the deleterious effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke are significant and long lasting. Health care professionals have key responsibilities in preventing tobacco use among youth and their families, and need to know more about effective smoking prevention and cessation strategies. Clinicians need to integrate tobacco counselling into health assessments of teenagers and be aware of the roles that families, communities and governments can play in promoting tobacco-free environments. Information, effective strategies and opportunities for health care professionals to intervene and advocate for Canadian adolescents are discussed. Ces dernières années, le Canada a connu une diminution générale de la prévalence de tabagisme dans tous les groupes d’âge. Cependant, malgré les multiples campagnes et interventions, des milliers de jeunes Canadiens commencent encore à fumer chaque année. La popularité croissante d’autres produits du tabac et de la cigarette électronique (vapoteuse) engendre d’ailleurs de nouveaux enjeux en matière de santé. D’après les recherches, les effets délétères de la nicotine et de la fumée du tabac sont prononcés et persistants.

The same may be said about statutes that attempt to prohibit the manufacture, sale, and use of drugs. Advocating drug prohibition makes some people feel good because they think they are “doing something” about what they believe to be a serious social problem. Others who support these laws are not so altruistically motivated. Employees of law enforcement bureaus and academics who receive government grants to study drug use, for example, may gain financially from drug prohibition. But as with using drugs, using drug laws can have moral and practical side effects so destructive that they argue against ever using legal institutions in this manner. One might even say—and not altogether metaphorically—that some people become psychologically or economically addicted to drug laws. That is, some people continue to support these statutes despite the massive and unavoidable ill",

Chez le toxicomane, il a ete demontre que la reexposition a la drogue contribue a precipiter le retablissement d'une consommation compulsive. Chez l'animal de laboratoire, la reexposition a la drogue induit la reinstallation d'un comportement eteint de recherche de drogue. Pourtant, les mecanismes intimes par lesquels la reexpositiona la drogue entraine cette reinstallation restent mal connus. L'objectif de ce trevail etait de determiner les processus comportementaux impliques dans la reinstallation induite par la reexposition a la cocaine. Nous avons mis en evidence que : 1/ l'administration de cocaine constitue un stimulus (interne) discriminatif qui controle l'expression du comportement prealablement execute en presence de ce stimulus. Ainsi, la reexposition a la cocaine peut reinstaller un commportement de recherche de nourriture, a condition que ce comportement ait ete prealablement execute sous les effets de la cocaine. 2/ la reinstallation induite par la cocaine ne depend pas de la valeur de la recompense prealablement obtenue. Ce resultat indique que la reinstallation n'est pas guidee par la representation des consequences du comportement (la reinstallation n'est pas un comportement par lequel l'animal cherche a obtenir la drogue). Ces resultats demontrent que la reexposition a la cocaine constitue un stimulus discriminatif qui controle l'expression de certains automatismes comportementaux. Cette reinstallation aitomatique non intentionnelle, pourrait expliquer la forte probabilite de rechute malgre la connaissance des cponsequences negatives.",

Nicotine dependence develops over time as a person continues to use nicotine. The most commonly used tobacco product is cigarettes, but any form of tobacco use and use of e-cigarettes can lead to dependence. Nicotine dependence is a serious public health problem because it causes continued tobacco use, which is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide, causing more than 8 million deaths per year. The result of the journal review is that preventing the use of tobacco products among adolescents is critical to ending nicotine addiction worldwide. The impact caused by nicotine tends to be bad, so stopping is the way out. Different levels of influence should be considered in interventions aimed at adolescent smokers, including psychological influences, addictions, peers and parents. This review article contains about the effect of nicotine on adolescents and what strategies can be done to stop the problem.",

In giving alcohol continuously the dose should be regulated by the signs. If it causes flushing of the face, dry skin, dry tongue, a throbbing, bounding pulse, even temporarily, and the odor of alcohol is on the breath, the dose is too large.

All things being equal otherwise, the weight and adiposity of smokers are lower than those of non-smokers. The calorie intake of smokers is equal to that of non-smokers, but the nicotine absorbed with each cigarette smoked temporarily increases the basal metabolism and in particular the energy expended in all physical activities. The lack of compensatory increase of food intake in response to the increase of energy expenditure explains why smokers are underweight. Food consumption might be reduced by an increase of circulating fatty acids and by a nicotine-induced inhibition of insulin secretion. The weight increase observed after tobacco withdrawal is caused by the normalization of expenditures and by release of the brake on food consumption. Weight increase is usually important in heavy smokers, women and subjects with low physical activity. Fifty per cent of smokers who have given up smoking put on less than 3 kg. The effort required to mitigate this disadvantage is modest and it can be delayed and separated from the acute weaning period with a medicinal treatment.",

However, far too little attention has been given to the consequences of the use of social drugs such as ethanol and tobacco, which are by far the most commonly abused substances during pregnancy. While the deleterious effects of cocaine or amphetamines on the mother and the fetus are more pronounced and easier to detect, the addiction to ethanol and tobacco is usually subtle and more difficult to diagnose. As a result recreational use of alcohol and tobacco may continue undetected in pregnancy, significantly effecting pregnancy outcome and obstetric and anaesthetic management of these patients.

Case Description: The current case report describes a 51-year-old African American woman using varenicline to reduce her cigarette use. After making a substantial reduction in cigarettes per day (from 25 to 8), the patient unexpectedly began smoking considerably more (from 8 to 20) after 11 days treatment with varenicline. Conclusions: The temporary increase in smoking while taking varenicline was likely the result of an ‘extinction burst’ where the extinction of a reward (e.g., nicotine's rewarding effects after smoking a cigarette) was temporarily associated with an increase in the behaviour usually associated with the reward (e.g., smoking a cigarette). Once explaining to her that no amount of cigarettes would overcome the feeling of reduced reward she likely felt while taking varenicline, she was able to reduce her smoking again.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Smoking tobacco cigarettes is a significant (cardiovascular) health risk factor. Although the number of tobacco cigarette users declined over the last decades, shisha smoking and e-cigarette vaping partially compensated for this health benefit. E-cigarettes may create highly addicted dual users (vaping and smoking). E-cigarettes seem not to represent a healthier alternative to tobacco smoking, although they may be less harmful. E-cigarette vaping causes oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and associated cardiovascular sequelae. This is primarily due to a significant overlap of toxic compounds in the vapor compared to tobacco smoke and, accordingly, a substantial overlap of pathomechanistic features between vaping and smoking. Whereas the main toxins in vapor are reactive aldehydes such as formaldehyde and acrolein, the toxic mixture in smoke is more complex, comprising particulate matter, reactive gases, transition metals, volatile organic compounds, and N-nitrosamines. However, it seems that both lifestyle drugs impair endothelial function to a quite similar extent, which may be due to the role of oxidative stress as the central pathomechanism to mediate endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage. Finally, the main selling argument for e-cigarette use that they help to quit smoking and get rid of nicotine addiction may be false because it seems that e-cigarettes instead trigger the opposite—younger entrance age and more frequent use. With our review, we summarize the adverse health impact of tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes, emphasizing the detrimental effects on endothelial function and cardiovascular health.",

Even after knowing that this dangerous addiction paves the way to one’s own grave, there isn’t much difference in the way the community sees this deadly habit. Time and again history has proven that this fatal addiction could make the life of those who consume it terrible. Also, the lives of the dear ones of alcoholic people are affected as alcohol not only affects those who consume them but also kin and friends. Various research studies conducted over many years clearly show the association of prolonged alcohol intake in the causation, aggravation, worsening, and deterioration of the health of its consumers. Moreover, chronic alcohol intake single-handedly is one of the major etiological factors in various serious diseases.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is an evocative psychological and medical term whose meaning has changed significantly over time. For most of this century it has been described in terms of an abstinence syndrome (dependence and withdrawal) and associated with heroin use. In the 1980s, however, cocaine replaced heroin as the prototypical drug of abuse. Cocaine had heretofore not been considered to produce “physical dependence.” Nonetheless, for both cocaine and heroin, current models of addiction — models widely propagated by the media —reduce drug use patterns to the properties of drugs and biological characteristics of the user. In creating this model, scientific and clinical debates along with public debates rely on the supposedly typical, inevitably addicting results of repeated cocaine consumption. Yet naturalistic human drug use and drug taking by animals in the laboratory instead reinforce the picture that use of all drugs depends on the user's environment-Indeed, even the most severe examples of compulsive drug use can be reversed when key elements in the setting are modified. Such findings should by now play a fundamental role in both scientific and public conceptions of addiction, but they do not.",

Although much drug use is a social activity, apart from those under international control, many other substances are consumed, including alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and khat. Alcohol and tobacco lead to more harm to individuals and society than all of the controlled drugs combined. The sale and use of alcohol may be restricted to certain users (e.g., adults) in certain places (e.g., licensed premises) and while undergoing certain activities (e.g., driving) but there is a widespread assumption that it is not a drug. The damage caused by tobacco smoking is a long-term effect that is not immediately apparent to users. Although nicotine, the psychoactive principal in tobacco, has long been regarded as a poison, it is available in skin patches and smoking devices with little current restriction. Caffeine rarely causes serious problems to consumers. Khat is a controlled drug in the United Kingdom and a few other countries but is not under international control.",

Los estilos y cultura del uso exponen estas personas a innumeras situaciones de riesgo, tales como enfermedades sexualmente trasmisibles, embarazo indeseado, actos de violencia, robos y trafico de drogas.Las implicaciones asociadas al uso de crack representan un problema importante para las politicas publicas de salud, para la ensenanza e investigacion de la practica clinica de los profesionales involucrados en la atencion de salud y especialmente para los profesionales de enfermeria, que constituyen las categorias mas numerosas en el equipo de salud.En Brasil, en el 2010, el Ministerio de la Salud instituyo el Plan Integrado de Enfrentamiento al Crack y Otras Drogas, visando a la prevencion del uso, al tratamiento y a la reinsercion social de usuarios y a la capacitacion profesionales, adoptando como premisa que el usuario del crack tiene derecho a salud y a rehacer su proyecto de vida.

All that is required for an unsuspecting person to replicate the experimental protocol is to consume a low tryptophan diet for 1 day before consuming the mixture. While probably few would take as much as in the study, the minimum conditions necessary to induce relapse are unknown. Abrupt return of intense depressive symptoms, as described in this study, might lead a person to discontinue otherwise effective antidepressant treatment or even become suicidal.

      "abstract": "The use of drugs for intoxication occupies a problematic space in the discussions of nineteenth-century inebriety. Physicians and reformers were familiar with alcohol consumption from first-hand experience, either of their own drinking or the drinking of people in their communities. Thus discussions about alcohol were not abstract. Notwithstanding that many of the images were stereotyped and at least moderately histrionic in construction, they drew upon familiar scenes and related to common (mis)conceptions of drink. The derelict drunk and the debased drinking space may have been tropes in nineteenth-century literature, but they were based upon familiarity. In contrast, drug inebriety was less common. Even though many people may have had experience with the effects of opium or other intoxicants (but most especially opium) through medical treatment, and even though some stories in popular fiction included elements of drug consumption, drug use was less public than drinking. As the chair of a mid-century select committee on intoxication in Canada West noted, drink was a public activity; opium consumption was done in private. 1 Moreover, as substances that were usually imported from faraway places, drugs like opium, cannabis, and cocaine were infused with exoticism, and racialized notions of the other. In much literature of the nineteenth century the meaning of opium, especially in its smoked form, was embedded in cultural myths of \"Asiatics\" or \"Chinamen\" in the Anglo-American world. Many of these images were delivered through the numerous accounts of westerners travelling throughout Asia as often brutal colonial regimes forced Asian nations to accept missionaries, most with a religious proselytization message, and almost always with a western superiority complex, into their territory.",

Even after knowing that this dangerous addiction is a life-threatening deal, still, ironically, the prevalence of smoking is more or less not getting reduced to a desirable extent. Those who smoke are becoming miserable because of their habit of smoking. Still, on the other hand, due to passive smoking, many more innocent lives are also adversely affected for no fault. This aspect of smoking, i.e., passive or second-hand smoking, is a fearful complication of smoking which is seldom seen with other modes of addiction. Time and again, numerous researches have highlighted the adverse effects of smoking on the human body and the interference it does bring in one's life. Smoking contributes to the deterioration of many preexisting ailments and depletes many valuable aspects of the human body. Smoking thus has a devastating effect on almost all of the tissues of our body and thus exerts its effect on nearly all the major organs. This review article is made by analysing various findings from many researches conducted across the globe by having a thorough search of Pubmed database, which in turn is the main methodology of the article. This review article aims to provide a simple and subtle understanding of the ill effects of smoking on the human body by serving the readers with a readymade platter of comprehensive knowledge about smoking coupled with efforts to eliminate the associated myths.",

Unfortunately, this experimentation can lead to substance abuse and addiction. Statistics show that drug abuse is a growing problem among young adults. This review highlights the causes of substance abuse among young adults in the society, the effects of this harmful substances and possible preventions of this social menace on young people. In Bonny Island, it has become most worrisome the rate at which young people are embracing drugs freely and unchecked. Worst still, young people are generating their mixtures using modern substances with unusual elements to create their own formula for severe drug intake. This means that drug intake has graduated from the use of sedatives like cocaine, heroin and cannabis that we used to know to potent mixture of several drugs to attain fatal overdose. For example, a cocktail of drugs like codeine, tramadol, cannabis with juice or soft drink is called “gutter water”. More crude is the smoking of lizard dung, sniffing of petrol, glue, urine and sewage as inhalant. This is gradually eating deep into our society like cancer. Actually, substance abuse is now part of a modern society but very worrisome is the alarming rate at which young adults are embracing hard substances.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is popularly believed to be a relatively benign substance. Cannabis is also considered to have potential medical benefits, and medical marijuana has been legislated in many parts of the world. However, a recent meta-analysis found that cannabinoids were associated with only modest benefits for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, small and inconsistent benefits for pain and spasticity, and inconclusive benefits for other indications such as improvement of appetite and weight, reduction in tic severity, and improvement of mood or sleep. On the flip side, cannabinoids and cannabis have acute and long-term adverse effects. In randomized controlled trials, cannabinoids increase the risk of total adverse events, serious adverse events, and dropout due to adverse events. Cannabis impairs cognition, and driving after cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents, including fatal accidents. Long-term cannabis use may lead to dependence, respiratory conditions, psychosis, and possibly cancer, as well. Cannabis use during pregnancy may compromise certain pregnancy outcomes such as fetal growth, and use during adolescence may compromise neurodevelopment, social adjustment, and vocational success. The composition and bioavailability of cannabis vary across preparations of the substance and routes of administration; this limits the ability to generalize the findings of studies. The findings of older research may no longer apply to current strains of cannabis that are higher in psychotogenic content. It is important for medical professionals and the lay public to understand the limitations of the efficacy data and the seriousness of the risks associated with cannabis use in medical and recreational contexts.",

      "abstract": "Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or e-cigarettes or vape pens/vaping devices are battery-powered devices used to smoke or ‘vape’, a flavoured solution containing varying concentrations of nicotine, an addictive chemical found in cigarettes and other forms of tobacco products. Amongst these various types of ENDS devices, e-cigarettes are the most common type. They produce an aerosolized mixture of the flavoured liquids and nicotine, which is inhaled by the user. Nicotine is considered as one of the most addictive substances. The rapidity at which it is introduced into the body, age of first exposure and the dosage administered all add to determine the potential risk of a person being addicted to it throughout life. Nicotine addiction is established more strongly when the exposure occurs in adolescence. The various flavours and attractive designs also add to the allure of these products to the young population.\r\n\r\nENDS or e-cigarettes are manufactured in such a way to resemble conventional tobacco products such as cigarettes, pipes and cigars and common gadgets such as flash drives, flashlights or pens (Figs. ​(Figs.11 and ​and22)1. Structurally, most e-cigarettes contain four different components: a cartridge or reservoir, which holds a liquid solution containing varying amounts of nicotine with flavourings, and other chemicals (e-liquid or e-juice), namely a power source (usually a battery), a heating element (atomizer) and a mouthpiece that the person uses to inhale. They date back to 17th August 1965 when the first documented patent for this type of device was issued in Pennsylvania. Since then, it took several decades of additional propagation before mass production was initiated in 2003 in China and some other countries. Currently, there are more than 460 different e-cigarette brands with varied configuration of nicotine delivery available in the market, for example, cigar-likes (first generation), tank systems (second generation) and personal vaporizers (third generation) with over 7700 flavours2. This makes collation of data on health effects more difficult for generation of scientific evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen in a separate window\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious types of electronic nicotine delivery systems devices.\r\n\r\nSource: Ref. 1",

      "abstract": "With prevalence approaching 20% in the United States, adolescent obesity has become a common problem for patients, parents, and clinicians. Obese adolescents may experience physical and psychosocial complications, as illustrated by the case of Ms K, a 14-year-old girl with a body mass index of 40. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of pediatric obesity treatment is modest in younger children and declines in older children and adolescents, and few interventions involving adolescents have produced significant long-term weight loss. Nevertheless, novel strategies to alter energy balance have shown preliminary evidence of benefit in clinical trials, including a diet focused on food quality rather than fat restriction and a lifestyle approach to encourage enjoyable physical activity throughout the day rather than intermittent exercise. Parents can have an important influence on weight-related behaviors in adolescents despite typically complicated emotional dynamics at this age, especially through the use of noncoercive methods. A key parenting practice applicable to children of all ages is to create a protective environment in the home, substituting nutritious foods for unhealthful ones and facilitating physical activities instead of sedentary pursuits. Other behaviors that may promote successful long-term weight management include good sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and mindfulness. Ultimately, the obesity epidemic can be attributed to changes in the social environment that hinder healthful lifestyle habits, and prevention will require a comprehensive public health strategy.",

      "abstract": "In addition to common stressors, members of the U.S. Armed Forces experience a high level of stress unique to their status as service members. In an effort to combat stress, many military personnel report high levels of nicotine use. This study investigated the relationship between tobacco use and perceived stress among military members in all four armed services. Results indicate that those who use tobacco products specifically to reduce stress report significantly higher stress levels than those who do not use tobacco. Moreover, current users and those who both smoked and used smokeless tobacco were far more likely to report experiencing \"a lot\" of stress from a variety of sources than former or never users. Tobacco users also engaged more frequently in negative coping behaviors and relied less on the positive coping strategies used more often by former or never smokers. These findings are consistent with the larger body of literature suggesting that tobacco is not only an ineffective stress-reducing strategy, it also likely perpetuates a stress response in users. It is, therefore, critical that the military improve effective means of coping among nicotine-using troops.",

Recent findings In this review, we have attempted to summarize some of the commonly consumed supplements, their alleged benefits, effects and side effects, along with the motivation that drives adolescents into consuming them. Summary The widespread use of dietary supplements among adolescents, in the background of lack of knowledge and medical guidance, predisposes adolescents to significant health risks. Although supplements may be necessary and safely consumed in certain specific situations, most healthy adolescents do not need them. The lack of regulation of supplements encourages contamination and ensures indiscriminate, easy access.",

Limited information exists about the proximal predictors of light smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes per day, particularly among college students. Participants (N = 118 young adults) completed a 7 day Tobacco Consumption Diary by recording for each cigarette smoked: time and day, location, number of people present, number of smokers present, mood, and whether alcohol was consumed. Results suggest light smoking is most strongly associated with the alcohol intake, later time of day, and multiple locations both within and outside the social context (but not at work). The amount smoked per day by light smokers does not appear to be influenced by the number of people present and number of smokers present. Overall, young adult light smokers appear to be cue oriented in their smoking similar to heavier smokers, despite lower levels of addiction and fewer cigarettes per day than heavier smokers. Light smokers may benefit from tailored intervention approaches to identifying the ideographic triggers that occur in certain locations and later time of day and are likely to include alcohol intake.",

It is not known whether protein needs are increased in ultraendurance athletes as a result of extended exercise training. Additionally, micronutrient needs may be altered for these athletes while dietary intake is generally over the RDA because of high caloric intake. Prior to competition, ultraendurance athletes should consider glycogen supercompensation and a prerace meal eaten 4 hrs before as a means of improving performance. Carbohydrate feedings during prolonged exercise can significantly affect performance. During events lasting over several hours, sodium sweat losses and/or the consumption of sodium-free fluids may precipitate hyponatremia.",

Das oesterreichische Kraftfahrrecht traegt dieser Problematik insofern Rechnung, als sowohl die Verkehrszuverlaessigkeit als auch die gesundheitliche Eignung von Drogenkonsumenten direkt in Zweifel gezogen wird.

Die Leistungsfunktionen koennen bei laenger dauerndem Drogenkonsum auch im nicht akut beeintraechtigten Zustand deutlich herabgesetzt sein. Ebenso stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit eine ausreichende Bereitschaft vorhanden ist, einen vielleicht nur sehr sporadischen Drogenkonsum von der Teilnahme am Strassenverkehr strikt zu trennen. Beide Punkte lassen sich im Rahmen einer verkehrspsychologischen Untersuchung mit Hilfe standardisierter Leistungstests und Persoenlichkeitsverfahren sowie einer ausfuehrlichen Exploration klaeren. Im Falle einer eignungsausschliessenden Befundlage besteht darueber hinaus auch die Moeglichkeit, gemeinsam mit dem Untersuchten Strategien zur Wiederherstellung seiner Fahreignung zu erarbeiten, was aufgrund des oft hohen Stellenwerts des Fuehrerscheins einen deutlichen Motivationsfaktor fuer eine kuenftig positive Entwicklung darstellen kann.

      "abstract": "It is not uncommon for parents to give their adolescent children sips of alcohol, despite it being well known that adolescent alcohol overindulgence is associated with major long-term harms. A prospective Australian study surveyed 1729 12–13-year-old schoolchildren and their parents (Time 1) and followed them up 1 year later (Time 2).1 The aim was to investigate associations between familial, parental, peer and adolescent characteristics at Time 1 and parental supply of alcohol at Time 2. The study found that 24.4% of parents supplied alcohol to their 13–14-year-old children at Time 2, usually on holidays or special occasions, family dinners and parties. Not surprisingly, parents who drank and had lax rules around alcohol were more likely to provide alcohol to adolescents. Less predictably, parents who perceived that their child engaged with substance-using peers were more likely to provide sips of alcohol, perhaps believing this might protect their child against unsupervised alcohol use with their friends. What is not yet known is the link between having or not having sips of alcohol in adolescence and later alcohol abuse.",

      "title": "Effects of acute and chronic nicotine administration on probability discounting",
      "abstract": "Nicotine use is a continuing public health concern. Smokers are more likely to make risky or maladaptive decisions compared to nonsmokers, so the relation between nicotine and risky choice warrants further investigation. Risky choice can be operationally defined as the choice for a larger, uncertain reinforcer over a smaller, certain reinforcer and can be assessed through a probability-discounting procedure. Acute nicotine administration has been shown to alter risky choice, but because the everyday smoker uses nicotine repeatedly, more research on chronic administration is needed and would allow for assessment of tolerance or sensitization of any effects. The present study examined effects of acute and repeated nicotine administration on probability discounting. Sprague–Dawley rats were used as subjects and the probability-discounting task involved discrete-trial choices between a small, certain reinforcer and a larger, uncertain reinforcer. The probability of larger-reinforcer delivery decreased across blocks within each session. Acute nicotine (0.1–1.0 mg/kg) administration dose-dependently increased risky choice, increased lose-stay ratios (a measure of response perseveration), and decreased reinforcement frequency. Tolerance to nicotine’s effects on larger-reinforcer choice was observed after repeated 1.0 mg/kg nicotine administration. The results of the present study add to the existing literature that acute nicotine administration increases risky choice and demonstrates that tolerance to this effect develops after chronic exposure to the drug. Possible behavioral mechanisms behind this effect are discussed, as are suggestions for future research on nicotine and risky choice.",

Anahtar Kelimeler : Sigara, St. Mutans, Laktobasil, Tukuruk akis hizi ABSTRACT It is known that low flow rate of saliva, high amount of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, is active in formation and advance of cavities. The objective of this study is to research the relation between smoking and the flow rate of the saliva also the amount of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli among dental faculty students of ages between 21 and 26. For the study, two groups of 25 individuals each are formed among the students of Aegean University Dentistry Faculty. Group A consists of non-smokers who have never smoked before. Group B is selected as smoking group which smokes at least 3 years and has divided into two as Group B1 abd B2. Group B1 consists of individuals, who are smoking 10 or less cigarettes per day. Group B2 consists of individuals, who are smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day. After the clinical mouth examinings, the DMFT index of the individuals are decided. It has been taken care that the avarage DMFT values of the individuals in the studygroups are close to each other. The stimulated saliva samples of the mentioned studygroups are taken. First the flow rate, then the mutans steptococci and lactobacilli amounts of the stimulated salivas are calculated. In statistical analysis of the obtained data, Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests are used. The results are evaluated with the significance level of p<0,05. According to the result of the statistical assessments, smoking among dental faculty students of ages 21-26, has no statistical significant relation with flow rate of the saliva, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli values. In the case of regular oral hygene habit, the effect of smoking on the flow rate of the saliva, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli numbers has been evaluated. With the result of this study, it has been concluded that smoking does not have a statistical significant effect on the flow rate of the saliva, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli values for the individuals, processing regular and aware oral hygiene care. It is being believed that, in the case of regular oral hygene habit, smoking has no effect in formation of cavities. But the case for a longer time period smoking should be researched. Key Words : Smoking, Mutans Streptococci, Lactobacilli, Salivary flow rate",

      "abstract": "Smoking has become one of the critical factors endangering human health. Under increasing personal health threats, many smokers have tried to escape from this habit. For those who want to quit smoking completely, whether adopt abrupt cessation or gradual cessation has been a controversial topic for many years. Abrupt cessation refers to quit smoking abruptly, without any nicotine intaking in the cessation period. Gradual cessation refers to quit smoking gradually, lowering the nicotine intake through the cessation period. So far, in this field, many researchers have stood with the opinion supporting the abrupt cessation, saying that abrupt cessation is effective in reducing smoking behavior and the chance of relapse. This article reviews the existing papers, aiming to evaluate the supporting information on abrupt cessation and gradual cessation, and give out an overview of existing controversy. The result suggests that the effectiveness of abrupt cessation cannot be neglected. However, through the consideration of smokers' preferences, the severity of being addicted, and drug intervention, gradual cessation may play a more critical role.",

      "abstract": "1. introduccion o motivacion de la tesis\nEl consumo de alcohol y tabaco esta presente en la etapa de la universidad, siendo las drogas que mas se consumen entre los jovenes en Espana. Es en el rango de edad entre 15-24 anos donde se encuentra mayor consumo de alcohol y tabaco, y mayor consumo de riesgo, coincidiendo con el rango de edad mayoritario en universitarios. La universidad es una etapa en la que muchos estudiantes tienen su primer contacto con estas drogas legales.\nEl alcohol y tabaco son drogas que estan arraigadas en la sociedad espanola, puesto que forman parte de acontecimientos y celebraciones, al igual que ocurre en la universidad, donde estas estan presentes a la hora de socializar y reunirse con otros universitarios, reuniones en las que el consumo de alcohol se da de una forma intensiva, de tipo binge drinking, los fines de semana.\nPor otro lado, en esta etapa se adquieren o se fortalecen ciertos habitos que con el paso del tiempo son complicados de modificar. Por lo que es fundamental adquirir unos habitos saludables, tanto en alimentacion, como actividad fisica y/o comportamiento sexual, para que asi perduren en las demas etapas de la vida. Por otra parte, los habitos saludables se pueden considerar como una proteccion frente a la adquisicion de habitos nocivos, en este estudio el consumo de alcohol y tabaco.\nTodo lo expuesto llevo a preguntarse ?Como es el consumo de alcohol y tabaco en universitarios?, ?Que habitos en relacion a la alimentacion, actividad fisica y comportamiento sexual tienen los estudiantes?, ?Existe una relacion entre estos habitos saludables y habitos nocivos? Asi mismo, dados los horarios que frecuentan los universitarios tambien surgen las preguntas ?Que cronotipo tienen los estudiantes?, y ?En que influye en sus habitos?\n\n2.contenido de la investigacion\nDiseno: Estudio de tipo descriptivo observacional comparativo.\nSujetos y ambito de estudio: Estudiantes universitarios de las Universidades de Cordoba y Castilla La Mancha (Espana). El estudio se planteo para abarcar la totalidad de estudiantes de ambas universidades. Criterios de inclusion: alumnos matriculados en las Universidades de Cordoba y Castilla La Mancha en estudios de Grado, Master y Doctorado. Participaron un total de 464 estudiantes, de los cuales se excluyeron 7 por cuestionarios incompletos. Reclutando finalmente una muestra de 457 alumnos.\nVariables del estudio: variables sociodemograficas, consumo de alcohol, consumo de tabaco, actividad fisica y deportiva, habitos alimenticios, comportamiento sexual y cronotipo.\nInstrumentos: Se utilizo un cuestionario que recogia datos sociodemograficos, asi como los cuestionarios especificos de las variables a estudio: el cuestionario Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) de Saunders et al. (1993) version en espanol por Guillamon et al. (1999); el Test de Dependencia a la Nicotina de Fagerstrom (1978) version de Becona et al. (1992), Test de Richmond (1993) version de Cordoba et al (2000), International Physical Activity Questionnarie (IPAQ-SF) Craig et al (2003), Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (Kidmed) Serra-Majem et al. (2004), la Encuesta Revisada de Opinion Sexual (EROS) de del Rio Olvera et al. (2013), y Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire de Adan y Almirall (1990).\nAnalisis de datos: el analisis estadistico se realizo con el programa IBM SPSS Statistics version 23. El analisis estadistico consistio en un analisis descriptivo mediante el calculo de recuentos (n) y proporciones (%) para las variables cualitativas y mediante el calculo de media (m) y desviacion estandar (DE) para variables cuantitativas. Tambien se realizo una comparacion de proporciones de las variables categoricas mediante pruebas ji-cuadrado para tablas de contingencia. Ademas, se realizo una regresion logistica multiple para identificar las variables asociadas al consumo de alcohol, tabaco, ejercicio fisico, adherencia a la dieta mediterranea, comportamiento sexual y cronotipo.\nConsideraciones eticas: El proyecto se presento al Comite de Etica de la investigacion de la provincia de Cordoba (Acta No 269, ref. 3640), Cumplimiento de la ley organica 15/1999, de 13 de diciembre, de Proteccion de datos, de caracter personal, del Estado Espanol. Normativa vigente en el periodo de estudio. El link de acceso al cuestionario presentaba al inicio el informe del Comite de Etica y la Hoja de Informacion y Consentimiento Informado.\nResultados: Los universitarios, estudiantes tanto de la Universidad de Cordoba (UCO) como de la Universidad de Castilla La Mancha (UCLM) tienen un consumo de alcohol de riesgo el 29,5%, dandose con mayor frecuencia en mujeres y en la UCLM. El 27,6% consume tabaco, teniendo baja dependencia el 78,6%, y la mitad de los estudiantes presentan motivacion para dejar de fumar.\nEl 52,5% de estudiantes practica actividad fisica de nivel alto, destacando este nivel en el genero masculino.\nCon respecto a la dieta mediterranea, el 37% presenta adherencia alta, en relacion al comportamiento sexual se muestra una tendencia hacia la erotofilia. Sobre el cronotipo en universitarios, tras el cronotipo intermedio, la predisposicion de los universitarios es de tipo vespertino (20,7%), destacando el sexo masculino en la vespertinidad.\nComparando las variables estudiadas, los consumidores de alcohol de riesgo tienen mayor dependencia a la nicotina, consumo de tipo binge drinking, se decantan por el cronotipo vespertino, mayor grado de erotofilia y practican actividad fisica de nivel alto. La dependencia a la nicotina y el consumo de tipo binge drinking se relaciona con la erotofilia. El cronotipo matutino se vincula con mayor adherencia alta a la dieta mediterranea.\n 3.conclusion Los datos obtenidos parecen indicar que los universitarios de la Universidad de Cordoba y Castilla La Mancha tienen un alto consumo de riesgo, con un consumo de tipo binge drinking, baja dependencia a la nicotina y alta motivacion para dejar de fumar. La practica de actividad fisica es de nivel alto y tienen alta adherencia a la DM. Opinion y actitud sexual de erotofilia, y cronotipo vespertino en su mayoria. Por otra parte, se relaciona el consumo de riesgo con mayor dependencia a la nicotina, consumo binge drinking, y vespertinidad. El consumo intensivo de alcohol y la dependencia a la nicotina se relacionan con mayor erotofilia, y la matutinidad se relaciona con alta adherencia a la dieta mediterranea.\n 4. bibliografia\n1.

      "abstract": "Beberapa tahun terakhir, rokok elektronik beredar pesat sebagai alternatif penggunaan rokok konvensional dengan tujuan menghindari dampak bahaya dari rokok konvensional. Bersamaan dengan peningkatan penggunaan rokok elektrik dalam beberapa dekade terakhir, penyakit paru yang disebabkan oleh rokok elektrik telah dilaporkan sejak tahun 2019. E-liquid mengandung beberapa senyawa berbahaya jika terhirup manusia dalam jangka waktu yang lama. Cairan E-liquidumumnya mengandung tiga bahan utama yaitu agen psikoaktif, pelarut, dan senyawa perasa yang semuanya memiliki potensi risiko kesehatan baik secara langsung atau melalui kombinasi zat tertentu. Penyakit pernapasan akut paling banyak yang berkaitan dengan penggunaan rokok elektrik ini dikenal dengan E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Beberapa gangguan pernapasan lain yang dapat terjadi akibat penggunaan rokok elektrik adalah penyakit paru obstruktif dan kanker paru.",

The most prevalent physical consequences are cardiovascular diseases, cancer of the throat and oral cavities, diseases of the bowel, eye, respiratory system, and reproductive system. Arguably, direct effects of tobacco smoking have been said to affect mental aspects of wellbeing such as depression, mood, and anxiety disorders. Undoubtedly smoking comes with many negative effects, but with implementation of smoking cessation strategies, it is possible to strengthen the overall health and wellbeing of smokers. As such, Health Canada recognizes the many health benefits associated with smoking cessation, by delivering health-promoting campaigns that strongly urge, it is not too late to quit.",

A growing body of both epidemiological and experimental evidences has reported the negative effects of incense use on human well-being, posing a potential threat at public significance. This work is a comprehensive review that covers the latest findings regarding the adverse impact of incense smoke on our health, providing a panoramic visualization ranging from mechanisms to implications. The toxicities of incense smoke come directly from its harmful constituents and deposition capacity in the body. Besides, reactive oxygen species-driven oxidative stress and associated inflammation seem to be plausible underlying mechanisms, eliciting various unfavorable responses. Although our current knowledge remains many gaps, this issue still has some important implications.",

      "abstract": "Dental staining, while always a significant problem, has become more important in recent years with the introduction and increased use of chlorhexidine-based mouthrinses. Not only do these rinses themselves cause staining, they also enhance staining from other sources, such as diet or tobacco use. An understanding of the etiologies of dental stains will help today's practitioners become more effective in managing dental stains in their practices. Important strategies for managing stain are patient education about the causes of staining, careful consideration of product recommendations for home use, and routine office visits for prophylaxis. Ideal products for patient use are those with effective stain-removal properties and low abrasivity, which minimizes tooth wear.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUA‡AƒO O uso abusivo de substA¢ncias psicoativas como a cocaA­na A© um grande problema de saAode pAoblica, e quando utilizada durante a gestaA§A£o compromete o crescimento e desenvolvimento da crianA§a. O uso desta substancia durante o perA­odo gestacional tem aumentado drasticamente durante as Aoltimas dA©cadas. Em alguns casos o recA©m-nascido exposto A  cocaA­na, aparentemente, nA£o apresenta qualquer tipo de comprometimento ou problemas neurolA³gicos, entretanto, com o passar do tempo manifesta alteraA§Aµes que comprometem sua condiA§A£o fA­sica e neurolA³gica.  OBJETIVO; Descrever o que a literatura tem apontado sobre o uso da cocaA­na por mulheres durante a gestaA§A£o e as consequAancias para as crianA§as Metodologia: Trata-se de uma revisA£o da literatura. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSAƒO: A exposiA§A£o fetal diante A  cocaA­na provoca diversos desfechos neonatais desfavorAiveis para bebAa, tanto fisiolA³gica quanto psicologicamente. A literatura aponta como principais consequAancias cefAilicas reduzidas para a idade, dificuldade no ganho de peso e alteraA§Aµes no desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor, podendo acarretar distAorbios comportamentais, de linguagem e dA©ficit motor. AlA©m disso, a cocaA­na, suprime o apetite materno e coopera para deficiAancia nutricional que, por conseguinte, prejudica os depA³sitos de gordura fetais e diminui a massa corporal. CONCLUSAƒO: Destaca-se, o grande desafio aos profissionais de saAode, em especial A queles da EstratA©gia SaAode da FamA­lia em planejar estratA©gias de prevenA§A£o de drogas, em especial no perA­odo gestacional, bem como utilizar a PolA­tica de ReduA§A£o de danos. Outro cuidado importante A© o acompanhamento minucioso dos recA©m nascidos filhos de mA£es usuAirias de cocaA­na, com vistas A  detecA§A£o precoce de alteraA§Aµes.  Aliado a isso, faz-se necessAirio o acolhimento e busca ativa dessas mA£es e suas crianA§as a fim de elaborar estratA©gias com foco na promoA§A£o da saAode e a qualidade de vidas crianA§as, transmitindo informaA§Aµes sobre os riscos inerentes a cada fase do desenvolvimento infantil, Por fim, acredita-se que os resultados do presente estudo possam contribuir para o estabelecimento de aA§Aµes educativas e preventivas voltadas para uso de cocaA­na e as consequAancias para crianA§a.",

Pagophagia (compulsive ice chewing) is a particular form of pica that is characterized by ingestion of ice, freezer frost, or iced drinks. It is usually associated with iron deficiency anemia or mental abnormalities like intellectual disabilities, autism, etc. Very few case reports have reported association of eating ice cubes with compulsive behavior or depressive disorders. In this case report, we present the association of pagophagia with sadness in a patient with recurrent depressive disorder. A 44-year-old female suffering from depressive disorder since the age of 33 years presented with symptoms of an intense desire to eat ice cubes that she was unable to resist and would feel better only after consumption of ice cubes or iced drinks. Initially she would consume about 250-500 g of ice cubes per day, but gradually the quantity of consumption of ice increased to about 10-12 kg of ice cubes per day. These symptoms were related to low mood and stress. The preoccupation with consumption of ice was associated with significant psychosocial dysfunction and interpersona problems with the spouse. She was managed with venlafaxine 187.5 mg/day and cognitive behavior psychotherapy (identifying her cognitive errors, generating alternative thoughts, problem solving, activity scheduling and mastery, and pleasure technique) with which her depressive symptoms improved and her pagophagia reduced significantly but did not subside completely. She learned to use alternative coping mechanisms to deal with her psychosocial stressors.",

These beneficial effects are often questioned in the scientific and lay media. LES are frequently accused of stimulating and/or maintaining a liking for sweetness which in turn would be deleterious for adequate body weight control. Evidence for the specific effects of LES use on appetite for sweet products will be extracted from observational studies, experimental laboratory studies, randomized controlled trials, and finally brain imaging studies. While many of the existing studies cannot identify any causal links between use of LES and appetite for sweetness, randomized trials in children and adults suggest that use of LES tends to reduce rather than increase the intake of sugar-containing foods and to facilitate, rather than impair, weight loss.",

      "abstract": "Women may have difficulty maintaining smoking cessation efforts due to negative affect and fear of weight gain. Dieting smokers who rely on cigarettes for affect regulation and weight management may be especially prone to weight gain and smoking relapse following initial smoking abstinence. The present study, which included 82 women smokers, assessed the relationship between dieting status, self-efficacy, and temptation to smoke and eat following a depressing or elating mood induction. Women with high levels of dietary restraint (i.e., more dieting behavior) had more confidence in their ability to refrain from smoking when in the elated mood condition, and they were more tempted to smoke when in the depressed condition. At low levels of dietary restraint (i.e., less dieting behavior), depressed or elated mood condition appeared to have little impact on women's confidence to refrain from smoking or their temptation to smoke. Dieting status seems to moderate the impact of positive and negative mood states, especially with respect to women's smoking behavior. These findings may have implications for dieters who are trying to quit smoking and also maintain their weight.",

      "title": "Electronic Cigarette Use (Vaping) Among Adolescents: A Narrative Review of an Emerging Public Health Epidemic",
      "abstract": "The current electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) format was made known to the public in recent decades. Since then, it has gained widespread popularity, particularly among adolescents. A significant portion of young people in the United States and around the world are reported to use e-cigarettes. The reasons for its popularity might be related to its many enticing flavors and being rechargeable. There are many different delivery systems and devices used for e-cigarettes. It took some time for governing organizations, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to place limitations and regulations on the distribution, advertisement, and easy access by minors. E-cigarettes have been advertised as a safer version of the typical (combustible) cigarettes. Nicotine is the main ingredient of most e-cigarettes. Small amounts of other chemicals, including heavy metals and known carcinogens, have also been detected. Evidence of the harmful nature of e-cigarettes is emerging and alarming. Short-term health effects of e-cigarette use may include oral, respiratory, and cardiac illnesses. Long-term outcomes of e-cigarette use, particularly among adolescents, are unknown. E-cigarettes may help with smoking cessation in adults, but their benefits among adolescents are lacking. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the risk factors and discuss potential complications associated with adolescent e-cigarette usage. We will also discuss the evidence for concurrent use of other legal and illegal substances with e-cigarettes. Evidence for the most effective ways for cessation is lacking, and further research is needed.",

Using longitudinal data on teens from all 50 United States from 1988 to 1992, we find a significant causal role for endogenous past cigarette consumption even after controlling extensively for observed and unobserved heterogeneity. We also find measurable evidence of different sensitivities to cigarette price depending on past use. These two findings suggest that a cigarette price increase will have a larger aggregate effect in the long run than in the short run as more individuals accumulate in the price-sensitive nonsmoking group.",

      "abstract": "Even if most people use cannabis without many negative consequences, some experience cannabis related harms. At higher levels of intake, one of these harms could be psychotic symptoms and even cannabis-induced psychosis. During the last years, we have seen increased treatment seeking for cannabis use disorders in Europe. Parallel with this increase we have seen an increase in the incidence of cannabis induced psychosis in all Scandinavian countries and an increased population attributable fraction for cannabis on the prevalence of schizophrenia has been demonstrated. All this may reflect increased use of cannabis, but more likely increased content of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is most cannabis products. Many have also pointed to the fact that we have seen an increase in the incidence of schizophrenia in the same period, maybe attributable to cannabis use. If we also take into consideration that up to one third of those with cannabis-induced psychosis over time receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia, we may see at least two implications. Firstly, these findings strengthens the evidence for a causative relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia, a causative relationship that man have suggested for several years, but that has had some opponents. Secondly, it points to cannabis-induced psychosis should be considered to be a part of the ICD-10 F2-chapter rather than the F1-chapter. This may be true also for the other substance-induced psychosis (F1x.5). An additional argument for this is that for no other psychotic diagnosis, a precipitation factor is mentioned in the diagnosis. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Ties between the United States military and the tobacco industry trace back to the early parts of the 20th century. During the second world war, for example, cigarette advertisements praising service members were widespread on popular radio programmes and in periodicals.1 Some ads even featured cigarette-using doctors vouching for the great taste and mildness of particular brands. Cigarettes were also included as part of the K-rations and C-rations provided to soldiers and sailors during the second world war, and these cigarettes frequently became more valuable for trading or selling than the food items in the rations.\n\nDuring times of war and peace, many young people (predominantly men, as they have traditionally comprised the bulk of military personnel) started smoking after they joined the military. In fact, it has been widely acknowledged in military circles that many young soldiers and sailors first started smoking during their initial military “boot camp” training. Before 1987, when tobacco use was banned at most training commands across the military services, giving or denying “smoke breaks” was a common form of reward and punishment used by drill instructors and company commanders training new soldiers or sailors.2 If recruits did not already smoke when they entered the military, in boot camp they quickly learned that smoking to get a work break was a desirable thing to do. Even beyond recruit training, the military culture—at least until relatively recently—has traditionally fostered the stereotype of heavy-smoking, hard-drinking, and adventuresome service members.\n\nThis image has had empirical support from several studies indicating that military rates of tobacco and alcohol use have been higher than those found in comparable civilian sectors.3-7 As of 1995, however, the military/civilian differences in tobacco use have narrowed.8 Considering all the services combined, the differences between the military and standardised civilian samples …",

It is worse in smokers with higher nicotine intake and can be reduced by a nicotine substitute. Although it may occur at any time during abstinence, it can be increased by stress and boredom and reduced when the smoker is kept occupied. Craving for cigarettes probably has multiple causation arising partly out of the perceived benefits of smoking and negative consequences of not smoking and partly as a direct result of loss of nicotine. Whatever its root causes it would be expected to involve general psychological processes such as associative learning and attribution. This paper draws together the threads of pharmacological and psychological levels of explanation for cigarette craving in an attempt to provide a clearer understanding of this phenomenon.",

Poison centers receive more than 100000 patients exposed to toxic plants. Most of these cases are inconsiderable toxicities involving pediatric ingestions of medicinal plants in low quantity. In most cases of serious poisonings, patients are adults who have either mistakenly consumed a poisonous as edible or ingested the regarding to its medicinal properties for therapy or toxic properties for illegal aims. Methods In this article, we review the main human toxic plants causing mortality or the ones which account for emergency medical visits. Articles addressing plant poisoning in online databases were listed in order to establish the already reported human toxic cases. Results The current review introduces herbal plants toxicity and herb-drug interactions to warn the health professionals about possible consequences of unconscious uses of medicinal plants. The reported cases extracted from our prepared database were classified on the basis of the main toxic effects of plants, and the most prominent constituents of the plants which are responsible for specific toxic effects. Conclusion Considering the long history of consumption of herbal medicines in different societies, people may wrongly think that medicinal plants are fully harmless and nontoxic. Prescription, preparation and consumption regulations of medicinal plants are not clear and strict as well as their marketing regulations that differ from country to country. The extensive and various consumption of medicinal plants without adequate observation is the most important reason for by medicinal plants.",

Worldwide, an estimated 2.3 billion individuals consume alcohol, with an average daily consumption of 33 grammes of pure alcohol. Self-esteem is a measure of one’s self-awareness and sense of personal worth. The process of behaving and then thinking about acts, as well as how others interpret actions, shapes one’s self-perception. Self-esteem refers to how we feel about ourselves and how much we regard ourselves. Alcoholism has far-reaching consequences and might result in mental health issues. One of the most typical effects found in alcoholics is the development of poor self-esteem. This term refers to a person’s total subjective sentiments of personal worth and value. It has a wide range of effects. It has an impact on a variety aspect of life, including substance abuse and recovery. The majority of alcoholics have a low sense of self-esteem. They have struggled to cope with their lives and frequently have significant emotional, family, social, and occupational issues, as well as financial, legal, and sexual issues. Coping is frequently studied in terms of its potential to reduce negative consequences. Coping skills can also help you achieve more favourable results.",

Nicht Lerninhalte werden gefragt sein, sondern Einsichten, persoenliche Orientierungen und eine kontrollierte Verhaltenssteuerung. Aus rechtlicher Sicht kommen folgende moegliche Zielgruppen in Betracht: Personen, bei denen die Fahrerlaubnis (FE) wegen Einnahme von Betaeubungsmitteln (BtM) entzogen war; Personen, bei denen die FE wegen missbraeuchlicher Einnahme von psychoaktiv wirkenden Arzneimitteln oder wegen anderen psychoaktiv wirkenden Stoffen entzogen war; Personen, bei denen sonst zu klaeren war, ob sie noch BtM einnehmen sowie gelegentliche Cannabiskonsumenten, bei denen weitere Tatsachen Zweifel an der Eignung begruendet hatten. Die geeignetste Zielgruppe fuer einen Kurs zur Wiederherstellung der Eignung sind die (ehemals) gelegentlichen Konsumenten von Cannabis mit Trennungsproblematik, regelmaessige Cannabiskonsumenten oder unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen Konsumenten anderer Partydrogen wie XTC, Speed oder Kokain. Eine Wiederherstellung der Eignung im Bereich der BtM-Konsumenten ist stets mit dem Ziel einer stabilen Drogenabstinenz zu verbinden, andere Kursziele waeren nicht konform unter anderem mit den Begutachtungs-Leitlinien.

The study reported here describes the process of spiritual awakenings experienced by some persons in recovery during their quest for sobriety. The data suggests that persons in recovery often undergo life altering transformations as a result of embracing a power higher than one's self, that is, a Higher Power. The result is often an intense spiritual journey that leads to sustained abstinence. Given how widespread substance abuse is, research on the nature, implications, and limitations of a spiritual approach to addiction might offer new options for treatment.",

However, according to the increase of the laws prohibiting sales of these substances without physician prescription, the route of getting and administration practices have become more and more dangerous. Anabolic androgenic steroids include many synthetic derivatives of testosterone its play a significant role in medical treatment. These groups of medications are extensively abused at young ages to rising lean body mass and advance the athletic quality of performance. It has been described that anabolic steroids use can cause many long and short-term side effects, this study intended to assess the level of knowledge about AAS and its effects among gym users. 50 bodybuilders were using gym routinely and were using AASs for at least 2 months and another who were using gym routinely but never use AAS before were interviewed to show their knowledge about short and long term AASs using side effects. Participants used androgenic hormones for three main reasons health, social and personal, vast majority of the participants obtained the required results by using AAS, The majority of participants were going into the gym five to six times weekly for an hour daily. Enanthate was the main steroid abused by the participants and the gym coaches were the major source of selling steroids to the participants. The anabolic androgenic steroids had a harmful effect and abused by large number of young ages.",

The subpopulations with the highest incidence of low literacy are nearly identical to those with the highest prevalence of tobacco use. Low-literacy smokers are more likely to underestimate the risks related to tobacco use, have less social pressure and support to quit smoking, may experience more life stress and consequently rely more heavily on nicotine use for stress reduction and require more assistance in developing a sense of self-efficacy. This indicates a need to modify smoking cessation methods of counselling, content and selection of educational materials for the marginally literate. Currently available low-literacy materials are listed, and suggestions for adjusting or developing materials are made.",

Objetivos En las últimas décadas ha aumentado el número de estudios centrados en cómo los trastornos alimentarios pueden conducir al desarrollo de la adicción a las drogas y en la comorbilidad que existe entre ambos trastornos. Nuestro objetivo es subrayar las similitudes entre el trastorno por atracón y los trastornos por uso de sustancias.Incluye los puntos en común conductuales y neurobiológicos entre el trastorno por atracón y la adicción a las drogas, centrándose especialmente en estudios recientes con animales. 2. Material y métodos Se realizó una revisión literaria no sistemática en las bases de datos Pubmed y PsicINFO, buscando las siguientes palabras clave: “trastorno por atracón”; “adicción” y “trastorno por uso de sustancias”. 3. Resultados y conclusiones Los atracones pueden ser un factor de riesgo o una puerta de entrada a la adicción a las drogas y, por otro lado, la adicción a los psicoestimulantes puede conducir a varios trastornos alimentarios. Si la alimentación es un factor de riesgo que afecta los mismos mecanismos neurobiológicos que las drogas de abuso, la exposición temprana a ciertos tipos de alimentos ultraprocesados podría ser una puerta de entrada a una mayor sensibilidad a la recompensa. La alta comorbilidad que existe entre los dos trastornos apoya la hipótesis y destaca la importancia de identificar y tratar ambas condiciones.Sin embargo hasta el momento, los psiquiatras que trabajan en centros de abuso de sustancias no siguen protocolos que aborden los trastornos alimentarios entre sus pacientes. Asimismo, los psiquiatras que se ocupan de los trastornos alimentarios no están capacitados para detectar o investigar el posible uso indebido de sustancias de abuso.",

      "abstract": "Prevention of injury involves identifying risk factors that would predispose one to injury and developing strategies to attenuate or eliminate their presence. Because muscle glycogen depletion is associated with fatigue and injury, it should be treated as a possible risk factor. Muscle glycogen stores are derived almost entirely from carbohydrate intake. Because there is a limited capacity to store muscle glycogen, and because muscle glycogen is the predominant fuel in exercise of moderate to severe intensity, the nutritional focus should be on carbohydrate consumption. Easy-to-follow nutritional strategies should be employed that will maximize muscle glycogen stores and delay the onset of fatigue. Individuals involved in activities lasting less than 60 minutes need to consume an adequate amount of carbohydrate daily and a pre-event meal before the start of the activity. However, individuals participating in activities longer than 60 minutes or participating in activities requiring repeated bouts of high intensity exercise need to: 1) consume an adequate amount of carbohydrate daily, 2) practice carbohydrate loading, 3) consume the pre-event meal, and 4) ingest carbohydrates immediately before, during, and after the activity.",

Definitions of harm minimization vary but a general statement is that harm minimization is a policy or programme intended to decrease adverse health, social and economic consequences of drug use, even though the user may continue to use psychoactive drugs. This type of definition is most often compared to a zero-tolerance policy that aims to eliminate all recreational drug abuse by legal and other means. Sociologists have historically scoffed at this latter policy. Unfortunately, what this has meant is that harm minimization in all its forms has not been the object of analytical work on the part of sociologists.",

Pleasure or habit, one British doctor in two does not smoke, and probably more people than ever before are trying to give up smoking. This is the result of the brilliant epidemiological studies which point so strongly to the relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer of the lung, and cigarette smoking and bronchitis (Smoking and Health, Royal College of Physicians 1962). Though the will may be there the way is not always easy, and a number of “anti-smoking” preparations are offered to help keep the smoker from his tobacco. They include astringent lozenges to make smoking unpleasant for him (Finifume; Nicobrevin; Terminex; Ancig; Stanwood treatment), lozenges containing a local anaesthetic and aromatic oils presumably to dull or lull his taste (present in some of the preparations named), and tablets containing lobeline to substitute for nicotine (Lobidan; Cigenda; Lobron). There are also cachous (tablets to be chewed or sucked) which are claimed to antagonise the flavour of tobacco without affecting the taste of food or drink (Nicoban).",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have been conducted investigating the reproductive toxicology of ethanol, the overwhelming majority concerning the adverse effects of consuming alcohol in beverages during pregnancy. Because many of the in vivo studies were designed to model alcoholism, they used comparatively high doses and assessed relatively few endpoints. Outcomes may have been affected by disturbances of metabolism at such high exposures, giving rise to secondary effects on development. The available data on ethanol from \"conventional\" developmental toxicity study test methods of the type used for regulatory hazard assessment of chemicals are limited. It is in this context, however, i.e. the use of ethanol as an industrial chemical rather than as a component of beverages, that this review is based. Using the usual criteria applied for the purpose of hazard assessment of industrial chemicals, it is concluded that there is no evidence that industrial exposure to ethanol is a developmental toxicity hazard. Developmental toxicity may result from drinking alcoholic beverages, the threshold level for all aspects of which has yet to be de fi ned. This is not, however, considered relevant to the low blood alcohol concentrations resulting from any conceivable inhalation or dermal exposure in the workplace or through the directed use of any consumer product containing ethanol.",

      "abstract": "For centuries, mouthwashes have been used in order to provide us with oral health or cosmetic benefits. Nowadays, in most countries, there is a variety of formulas available for the general public in the form of products which may require prescription or not. Alcohol is used in mouthwashes as a solvent of other ingredients and as a preservative of the preparation. For years, different formulas of mouthwashes have been used, however, the question about its alcohol content being a threat for health or not has recently appeared. The high quantity of alcohol in some mouthwashes combined with the fact that they keep in contact with the oral mucosa for much more time than alcoholic drinks, can make us think about a harmful effect from a local mechanism. Mouthrinses increase the time of the mucosa being in contact with alcohol and it has been proved that those with a high content of alcohol do cause hyperkerastosic lesions both in human beings and laboratory animals. At the moment and with the data we have, it has not been possible to establish a causal relationship between the use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes and the development of oral cancer. There is neither an evidence of the fact that alcohol increases the effects of antiplaque agents in mouthwashes.",

      "title": "Role of Nanotechnology in Taste Masking: Recent Updates",
      "abstract": "One of the important parameters in the case of dosage form is taste. Most of the drugs available in oral dosage form have an unpleasant taste which leads to patient incompliance and affects the success ratio of products in the market. Geriatric and paediatric patients suffer more with the bitter taste of medicines. According to the studies reported, it is found that 50% of the population have the problem swallowing tablets, especially the pediatric and geriatric population. Masking the taste of bitter drugs has become necessary in the pharmaceutical field and increasing interest of researchers to develop various methods for masking the bitter taste of drugs. Five major tastes, felt by our tongue are salt, sour, sweet, bitter, and umami. When the drug dissolves with saliva, drug molecules interact with taste receptors present on the tongue and give taste sensations. Although, many solid oral dosage forms like pills, and tablets have an additional advantage of masking and encapsulation of bitter taste drugs; however, they might not be effective for children because they may or may not swallow pills or tablets. There are various other methods that mask the bitter taste of drugs such as the addition of sweeteners and flavouring agents, granulation, coating, inclusion complexes, extrusion method, ion-exchange resins, etc, discussed in the first section of the article. The second part of this article consists of various nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems that were fabricated by researchers to mask the bitter taste of drugs. A brief of recent literature on various nanocarriers that were fabricated or developed for taste masking has been discussed in this part. A better understanding of these methods will help researchers and pharmaceutical industries to develop novel drug delivery systems with improved taste masking properties.",

      "title": "Smoking Cessation Leads to Reduced Stress, but Why?",
      "abstract": "Recent longitudinal studies have demonstrated that smoking cessation leads to reduced feelings of stress. This finding is not predicted by either of the two main models for smoking behavior. The nicotine resource model (Warburton) states that nicotine is used to cope with external stressors, and predicts that smokers will suffer from increased stress when they quit smoking. The deprivation reversal model (Schachter), suggests that smoking reverses the deleterious effects of deprivation; cessation will then lead to a period of increased stress, followed by a return to baseline. Although the stress/cessation data agree with neither model, they are consistent with a third explanation, namely that smoking causes stress. This model states that acute nicotine deprivation (i.e., between cigarettes) leads to increased stress. Smokers then use cigarettes to reverse these withdrawal effects and \"normalize\" their mood. This model explains some paradoxical aspects of the smoking/mood relationship. First, why smokers are calmed by smoking, yet report high average levels of stress. Second, why stress levels become reduced after smoking cessation; this is because the former smoker no longer suffers from the adverse mood effects of acute nicotine depletion.",

Although most over-the-counter drugs have an excellent safety profile, some have unproven safety or are known to adversely affect the fetus. The safety profile of some medications may change according to the gestational age of the fetus. Because an estimated 10 percent or more of birth defects result from maternal drug exposure, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has assigned a risk category to each drug. Many drugs have not been evaluated in controlled trials and probably will not be because of ethical considerations. Of the commonly used over-the-counter medications, acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine, kaolin and pectin preparations, and most antacids have a good safety record. Other drugs, such as histamine H2-receptor blockers, pseudoephedrine, and atropine/diphenoxylate should be used with caution. If use of smoking cessation products is desired, the intermediate-release preparations minimize the amount of nicotine while maintaining efficacy. With all over-the-counter medications used during pregnancy, the benefit of the drug should outweigh the risk to the fetus.",

The study found that the death causes of kings were lifestyle habits that harm their health such as geriatric diseases, complications and various illnesses to shorten longevity which result from oily foods, sensual pleasures and the reduction of the resistance by lack of exercise. Most of the Joseon kings suffered from both a lot of work and strengthening their governing power, and it brought them a plenty of mental stresses with lack of exercise. These mental fatigues increased appetite for greasy food to cause disease, and then too much sexual solicitation of concubines was followed with fullness. Thus all the stresses could end up with overeating and too much intercourse to death.",

      "title": "The Negative Impact of Food Neophobia on the People of Chandigarh Tri-City, India",
      "abstract": "Food neophobia (FN) is the person’s fear to try eating new or unfamiliar foods. Food neophobia is directly attached with low quality of diet in adults; thus, the understanding of the relationship between FN and food consumption in more depth appears to be a key issue [1]. There are various factors that influence this eating behaviour of a person such as fear, taste, unwillingness, bad experience and lack of knowledge etc. The level of food neophobia generally decreases with late childhood to adult and increases with adult to old age.\r\nThrough the demographical influences or the inherited properties of the individual food neophobia can be displaced.  At some point of time in our life we all have said no to some particular food item because of our liking or disliking. Sometimes we do not eat some food due to the fear of trying a new food. A bad experience with a particular food may become the reason with some people not trying new food; similarly, lack of knowledge about different foods has been a factor that many people avoid trying a new food. There may be many other reasons for people to avoid or not trying new food. These eating behaviours of people leave them from getting proper nutrition that they need. Because they have restricted them to limited types of food, they may not be eating enough vitamins or nutrients. It’s been observed that neophobia can not only lead to malnutrition, but it also refrain the individual from social abilities. Food neophobia also restricts the individual from taking the healthier alternative of the food and also restricts in trying the new or traditional food items [2] [3].\r\nThe aim of the study was to access the relationship between food neophobia with demographic factors, and education in adults living in urban versus rural areas. This research has been conducted in the Tri-city, Punjab India. Primary data was collected from urban, suburban and rural areas through Google forms, print questionnaires and personal interviews. The questionnaire used in the study indicates the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS), the gender based choices, questions regarding food choice based on demographic factors like gender, age and income, questions on eating behavior and the different eating habits in relation to urban and rural. Data were collected via questionnaire. Total 600 people of age groups (30-45 years & 46 – 60 years) among diversified population of tri-city, Chandigarh, Panchkula & Mohali were given the questionnaires to fill-up.  441 useful responses were received which includes 246 responses from females and 195 responses from males.\r\nThe questionnaire was designed in such manner that it captures data regarding age and gender under demography, and education among people residing in rural as well as urban areas of the tri-city.\r\nThis research will give a insight about the malnutrition due to food neophobia specially in females, we found that geographical location plays an important role and the type of food preferred by urban and rural and the outcomes due to eating habits. This study will give an insight about the eating habits in relation to income and expenditure. We found that food neophobia strongly influence the variables selected for the study. Overall, the results suggest that food neophobia is an important barrier to dietary change and addressing diet-related health problems.  Actions focusing on alternate food choices may help to reduce the neophobia in adults thus increase the chances of maintaining the nutritious diet. Certain theoretical and practical implications in relation to food consumption and food neophobia are offered. Further research is recommended to confirm the observed relationships under different socio-cultural conditions.",

What is more shocking is the fact that people from virtually all walks of life have been found to indulge in drug use, which was once thought to be limited to those involved with entertainment establishments. It is particularly ominous that a rising number of teenagers are using drugs. Young people often know more about drugs than do their parents and teachers and the teenager who doesn`t know where he can find illegal drugs is a rarity. Today many young people experiment with drugs. Drug use is a health hazard with particular relevance to young people. Adolescent psychoses occur in association with drug-taking. Persistent drug use may block development. It may promote extremely dangerous behaviour; it is associated with suicide attempts and fatal or debilitating accidents through the power of drugs to alter perception and psychometer reactions. As with alcohol abuse, the drug user is likely to fail in many ways, at school, in relationships, and at work. Many young people have turned to crime and prostitution to maintain their supply of drugs. The author suggests various preventive strategies for adolescent drug abuse in relation with the law on protection for youth in Korea. The preventive strategies should cover national survey an youth drug abuse, drug education for students, treatment and rehabilitation for drug users, and drug abuse related laws and regulations.",

      "abstract": "What is this ‘physical activity’ thing people keep talking about? Simply put, physical activity is movement of the body (this may be your upper or lower body or both) which expends energy. It is important to remember that physical activity does not just mean exercise! Physical activity is an ‘umbrella term’ which encompasses a range of domains, such as being active in your leisure-time (like taking the dog for a walk or going to a dance class), walking and cycling for transport (this may be going to the local shops or it may be in an effort to beat the peak hour traffic), being active at work (like lifting boxes or laying bricks) and even undertaking active chores at home such as gardening and vacuuming. In Australia, it is recommended that adults accumulate 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity (equivalent to that of a brisk walk) on most, if not all days of the week. If preferred, this activity may be broken up into three 10-minute bouts, which is good news for busy people! This ‘dose’ of physical activity is the minimum amount required for health benefits and has been shown to prevent a number of chronic illnesses that will be discussed in further detail later in this chapter. So why has the government spent up big on mass media campaigns such as ‘Life. Be in it’ (thinking back to the 90s — who remembers the couch potato cartoon character Norm who was the face of that campaign?), and more recently the ‘Swap it, don’t stop it’",

      "title": "Health hazards of Energy Drinks and Positive Actions by Saudi Government",
      "abstract": "An energy drink is a type of  beverage  containing stimulant drugs, chiefly  caffeine , which is marketed as providing mental and physical stimulation. They may or may not be  carbonated  and many also contain sugar or other sweeteners,  herbal extracts  and  amino acids . First commercial energy drink was introduced in Europe in 1987 and the sale of these drinks increased rapidly throughout the world. These drinks are based on caffeine which acts through inhibition and activation of various receptors, and thus affects almost all the body systems. There is an increasing body of evidence about the medical hazards of uncontrolled use of these drinks , with neurologic, psychiatric, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. (1) Mostly the energy drink contains taurine, caffeine, herbal extracts and carbohydrates. These drinks contain caffeine about 80 to 141 mg per cent. (2) Dangers of taking too many energy drinks at one time includes cardiac arrest, headache and migraine, insomnia, addiction to caffeine, nervousness, risky behavior and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Specific effects that have been reported by energy drinks include jitteriness, dizziness, the inability to focus, difficulty concentrating, gastrointestinal upset, and insomnia. Health care providers report that they have also seen the following effects from the consumption of energy drinks: dehydration, accelerated heart rates, anxiety, seizures, acute mania, and strokes. (3) International health organizations have warned the public against consuming such drinks particularly young people under the age of 16, pregnant women and those with cardiac problems and diabetes. (4) Saudi Arabia recently banned the sale of energy drinks at government, health and education facilities and outlawed all forms of advertising for the drinks, including the sponsorship of any sporting, social or cultural events by energy drinks companies. The Cabinet meeting of Saudi Arabia approved number of actions according to the Saudi Press Agency, these includes:  1 - To prohibit advertising of any energy drinks or do advertising or promotional campaigns for any energy drink via any readable, audible or visible media or by any other means.”  2 - To prohibit energy drinks companies, their agents, distributors and marketing associations from sponsoring any sporting, social or cultural event, or taking any procedure leading to promotion.  3 - To prohibit the free distribution of energy drinks to consumers of all age groups.  4 - To prohibit the sale of energy drinks in restaurants and canteens in government facilities; education and health facilities; halls and public and private sports clubs.  5 – Decision has been taken, factory owners and importers of energy drinks shall be committing to writing a text on the tin of any energy drink in Arabic and English languages - warning of the harmful effects of energy drinks.

      "title": "Escalation of Drug Use",
      "abstract": "Among the different behavioral criteria used to discriminate substance dependence (or drug addiction) from other non-disordered forms of drug use, drug intake escalation presents a number of unique features that makes it particularly suitable for modeling in nonhuman animals. This criterion has stood the passage of time despite major revisions of diagnostic systems, it is common to all known drugs of abuse and it can be readily and unambiguously operationalized in laboratory animals. Here I exhaustively review evidence showing that escalation to heavy consumption of different drugs (except perhaps nicotine) can be rapidly induced in the majority of individual animals (i.e., rats) by increased drug availability. Such an escalation of drug use is probably paralleled by an authentic escalation to drug addiction, as it is associated with the co-occurrence of other addiction-like changes (i.e., increased motivation for drug use; increased difficulty to abstain from drug use; decreased sensitivity to negative consequences). In addition, during escalation of drug intake, most individual animals become increasingly responsive to drug- and stress-primed, but apparently not cue-primed, reinstatement of drug seeking after extinction. Finally, following increased drug use, most individuals present selective cognitive dysfunctions (e.g., deficits in executive functions) that may contribute to the establishment and/or persistence of addiction. Thus, the study of individuals with escalating patterns of drug use should provide a unique and valid approach to investigate, experimentally, the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the progression to addiction.",

La población usa el alcohol como estrategia para reducir el estrés, sin embargo, la reflexología facial es una terapia alternativa que ayuda a disminuir este padecimiento. El objetivo fue Reducir el estrés y consumo de alcohol mediante reflexología facial en adultos mexicanos. Metodología. Estudio pre-experimental con diseño pre-test y post-test mediante muestreo no probabilístico por conveniencia, muestra de 15 participantes. Se empleó la Escala de Estrés Percibido, el Cuestionario de Identificación de los Trastornos debido al Consumo de Alcohol y reflexología facial, apegándose al Reglamento de la Ley en Salud en Investigación. Resultados. Disminución de estrés en diversos porcentajes como el reactivo ¿con que frecuencia se ha sentido incapaz de controlar las cosas importantes en su vida? pasó de 33.3% a 86.7% (nunca/casi nunca) y ¿con qué frecuencia ha manejado con éxito los pequeños problemas irritantes de la vida? pasó de 53.3% a 86.7% (a menudo/muy a menudo). En el cuestionario de consumo de alcohol, el reactivo con mayor cambio en la medición fue en el patrón de frecuencia y cantidad ¿Qué tan frecuente consumes alguna bebida alcohólica? al pasar de 33.3% a 80% (una o menos veces al mes). El consumo perjudicial disminuyó del 53.3% a 40.0%. Hay diferencia significativa en pre-test y post-test en estrés (Z=-3.025, p=0.002), AUDIT (Z=-2.950, p=0.003) y copas en un día típico (Z=-3.220, p=0.001). Discusión. Los resultados mostraron disminución del estrés y consumo de alcohol, sin embargo, es limitada la información relacionada a la ingesta de alcohol.",

      "title": "Dopaje: premisas para la valoración ética",
      "abstract": "El dopaje se define como la promocion, incitacion, consumo o utilizacion de las sustancias y grupos farmacologicos prohibidos y de los metodos no reglamentarios destinados a aumentar, artificialmente, las capacidades fisicas de los deportistas o a modificar los resultados de las competiciones en las que participen. Las sustancias utilizadas en el dopaje provocan un aumento artificial del rendimiento deportivo y, al mismo tiempo, pueden llegar a desestabilizar las funciones fisiologicas del organismo en detrimento de la salud. El dopaje es un tema de actualidad por tres motivos: el gran numero de casos detectados, la sofisticacion de los metodos empleados, y su repercusion en los medios de comunicacion. No obstante, no es algo nuevo. El ser humano ha buscado, en todas las etapas de la historia, vias para mejorar su rendimiento fisico e intelectual. Es conocido como los chinos utilizaban la efedra cientos de anos antes de Cristo o los nativos de los Andes la coca. Despues se fueron introduciendo otras sustancias como la cafeina, las hormonas o la eritropoyetina. Tambien se ha buscado, en todas las etapas de la historia del deporte, la ayuda ergogenica en la alimentacion. Por ejemplo, se dice que en la Grecia clasica se intentaba mejorar los records mediante la ingesta de carne de cabra los saltadores, de toro los corredores y de cerdo los luchadores. La ultima polemica sobre dopaje es la del denominado Doping tecnologico. Ha tenido su mas reciente expresion en los trajes de bano de poliuretano de oro. Las muchas marcas mundiales que se rompieron en los Mundiales de Natacion de Roma, en el ano 2009, fueron relacionadas con la fabricacion de trajes de este material que permitia al nadador flotar con mayor facilidad. Segun Costa, las primeras referencias de dopaje en la epoca moderna se situan en el siglo XIX. “Cuando las famosas carreras de los Seis dias empezaron en 1897, los atletas de muchas naciones utilizaban distintos tipos de formulas para incrementar el rendimiento deportivo: los atletas franceses preferian mezclas de cafeina, los belgas azucar diluido en liquidos alcoholicos, y los velocistas se especializaban en la nitroglicerina.

      "title": "Food Addiction",
      "abstract": "The evidence for food's addictive properties is steadily growing. In addition to clinical and evolutionary plausibility, the possibility of addiction to food is supported by animal model research and increasingly by research with humans. Much as classic drugs of abuse \"hijack\" the brain, accumulating evidence with food suggests a similar impact, but with weaker effects. Although neurobiological evidence for food addiction is compelling, dependence as conceptualized with respect to alcohol and other drugs of abuse is fundamentally a behavioral disorder. Thus, we review the current state of food addiction research in the context of each of the diagnostic criterion for dependence (ie, tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control) and briefly explore other relevant addiction topics such as expectancies, reinforcement, and incentive salience. There is substantial evidence that some people lose control over their food consumption, suffer from repeated failed attempts to reduce their intake, and are unable to abstain from certain types of food or reduce consumption in the face of negative consequences. Although there is some evidence for other dependence criterion, further research is needed to examine tolerance and withdrawal to high-fat sweets, time spent in obtaining, using, and recovering from excess food consumption and the degree to which important activities are given up due to overconsumption. As science continues forward and both the public and elected leaders become aware that food may trigger an addictive process, this information will likely be used to inform policy. Thus, researchers need to carefully consider the implications of their work and the way in which the results may be interpreted.",

Attempts to obtain from numerous addicts an adequate description of their feelings and emotions while under the influence of the drug has left much to be desired. \"God's own medicine,\" a term frequently used by Osler, when he prescribed morphine, is a common expression used by the addict.

      "abstract": "We don't know why, but the use of nicotine is associated with the use of other substances, whether you look retrospectively in a clinical trial situation or prospectively in carefully defined groups.The association is always there and always very clear.My data show that among methadonemaintained patients who were trying to quit smoking, they were more likely to use illicit drugs on any day they smoked. Anne Joseph:There is no doubt that quitting smoking has health benefits with respect to lung disease and many other conditions.Whether it has good, bad, or no effects on chemical dependency outcomes is still up in the air, unfortunately.For a long time there were worries, not founded on any data, that there would be adverse effects.There have been about a dozen studies that did not seem to demonstrate such effects, and a few suggested smoking cessation might even have a beneficial effect on treatment outcomes.Lirio Covey: Most of the evidence has been on recovered groups, and it shows that if people quit smoking after being abstinent from alcohol for a while, quitting smoking does not jeopardize that abstinence.Dr. Sharp and colleagues, however, are talking about people in early recovery.We know very little about how smoking cessation will affect that group.I have some concerns.I see a parallel to the state of our knowledge with regard to smoking and psychiatric conditions such as major depression.We know a lot about people with past major depression.But we don't know what will happen if people stop smoking when they are still depressed or just recently got over their depression. Joseph:We just completed a randomized trial of treatment for nicotine dependence given concurrently with alcohol treatment, comparing it to nicotine treatment delayed by 6 months.The smoking cessation outcomes were identical in the two groups, in the neighborhood of 15 or 16 percent at 12 months.However, there is sometimes a trend and sometimes a statistically significant difference in alcohol treatment outcomes that favors delayed treatment.This is not the result we were expecting.Covey: Anne, can you speculate on the explanation for your finding?Joseph: One possibility has to do with pharmacological interactions between nicotine craving and alcohol craving.For example, abstinence from cigarettes may cause nicotine craving, and that might trigger intense craving for alcohol.Depression is another possible explanation for these findings.Many alcohol-dependent patients are depressed.If their depression is exacerbated by nicotine abstinence or relative nicotine deprivation, perhaps patients will use alcohol to self-treat their depression.Shoptaw: When you work with people who have multiple substances of dependence, removing one doesn't necessarily affect the others.Or it may.We don't know.Joseph: Our study results have yet to be duplicated.In addition, in contrast to the ATC scenario described in this article, the nicotine treatment in our study was not compulsory.All in all, the question of how con-",

      "abstract": "Abstract Gradually, at times imperceptibly, in the years after World War I, use of narcotics in the United States declined. The nadir was reached during World War II; not only had usage gone down prior to those hostilities, but it declined even further as the disruption of international transportation cut down on supplies. From being easily available and commonly used, heroin, morphine and cocaine almost faded out of nonmedical situations: when someone was caught with drugs, the event elicited headlines and comment. Once commonplace, narcotics use waned into little more than rumors about this physician or that movie star. Personal knowledge of a “dope fiend” was unusual for the vast majority of Americans by the 1950s.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of caffeine-containing beverages may be motivated to a significant extent by anticipation of benefiting from the stimulant properties of caffeine, though almost certainly more important is the consumer's acquired liking for the beverage. The latter is reinforced, at least in part, by the psychopharmacological consequences of caffeine ingestion. Crucially, this reinforcement appears to occur most readily in the context of acute caffeine abstinence, an observation which in turn is consistent with recent findings on the impact of caffeine and caffeine withdrawal on mood and cognitive performance. These findings indicate that 'withdrawal relief' or 'reinstatement' is a major effect of caffeine consumption in everyday life, leading to the conclusion that the actual or net benefits of regular caffeine consumption are considerably smaller than the felt benefits.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Utilisation of tobacco is one of the most serious problems affecting human health worldwide, despite the fact that the early fatality caused by tobacco use are growing, regardless of the fact that it is avoidable tobacco consumption is very common, considerable resources have been allocated to this issue. On tobacco prevention, a range of strategies have been tested but the ratio of death due to tobacco and number of tobacco consumers is increasing day by day. Various impediments to tobacco quitting have been recognized, all of which contribute to the failure of various tobacco cessation programs and methodologies. Individuals in the India have attempted or considered quitting smoking at some point in their lives but ended in failure. Existing tobacco cessation programs have not out-turned in a decrease in the figure of tobacco users or deaths, necessitating a new strategy. Tobacco cessation on prescription, developed from physical activity on prescription (PAP), can be a useful method in terms of public health. But yet no studies have ever been conducted over this. Further studies on this can explore results of tobacco quitting after prescription from general physician or other medical practitioner, evaluative beliefs about tobacco consumption and barriers in quitting even after prescription. Hence the present review was done with explore the outcomes for cessation of tobacco based upon utilization of tobacco cessation by prescription (TCP) methodology in Indian scenario. This review paper focuses on TCP as a need for newer approach pertaining to Indian perspective. Future study should look at whether raising the rate of stop attempts are improving the tobacco cessation rate in the general population after the implementation of TCP.",

      "title": "Neuropsychological Effects of Caffeine: Is Caffeine Addictive?",
      "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely used psychotropic drug in the world. Most of the caffeine consumed comes from coffee bean (i.e., a misnomer for the seed of Coffee plants), beverages (i.e., coffee, tea, soft drinks), in products containing cocoa or chocolate and in medications (i.e., analgesics, stimulants, weight-loss products, sports nutrition). The most prominent behavioral effects of caffeine take place over low to moderate doses are amplified alertness and attention. Moderate caffeine consumption leads very rarely to health risks. Higher doses of caffeine encourage negative effects such as anxiety, insomnia, restlessness and tachycardia. The habitual use of caffeine causes physical dependence that displays as caffeine withdrawal symptoms that harm normal functioning. Contrariwise, rarely high doses of caffeine can encourage psychotic and manic symptoms usually, sleep disturbances and anxiety. Even though caffeine does not engender life-threatening health difficulties frequently related to the utilization of drugs of addiction, for example amphetamine, cocaine and heroin, an incrementing number of clinical studies are exhibiting that some caffeine users become dependent on the drug and are unable to reduce consumption despite knowledge of recurrent health complications linked to constant use. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), includes caffeine addiction and withdrawal as mental disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies caffeine dependence as a clinical disorder. Furthermore, diagnosis process of caffeine dependence syndrome is accepted by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10). Therefore the intention of this study was to analyze the neuropsychological effects of caffeine and try to assess in which respect caffeine could be considered a potential drug of addiction.",

Research on cannabis and the lungs has been limited by its illegal status, the variability in strength and size of cannabis cigarettes (joints), and the fact that most cannabis users also smoke tobacco, making the effects difficult to separate. Despite these difficulties, the available evidence indicates that smoking cannabis causes bronchitis and is associated with changes in lung function. The pattern of effects is surprisingly different from that of tobacco. Whereas smoking cannabis appears to increase the risk of severe bronchitis at quite low exposure, there is no convincing evidence that this leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Instead, cannabis use is associated with increased central airway resistance, lung hyperinflation and higher vital capacity with little evidence of airflow obstruction or impairment of gas transfer. There are numerous reports of severe bullous lung disease and pneumothorax among heavy cannabis users, but convincing epidemiological data of an increased risk of emphysema or alveolar destruction are lacking. An association between cannabis and lung cancer remains unproven, with studies providing conflicting findings.",

Many studies have demonstrated that alcohol consumption in mild to moderate level, compared with abstention, lowers the risk of dementia. Other studies however do not suggest such association. There are several mechanisms to describe the positive effects of alcohol consumption on the brain function. One to two drinks daily of alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, or liquor) could lower the risk of dementia. The types of alcoholic beverages are not significantly different in such association. In conclusion, it would seem that a mild to moderate level of alcohol consumption might be associated with a lower risk of dementia.",

Los cartuchos de nicotina tienen mucha variabilidad en la cantidad de nicotina liberada, incluso dentro de la misma marca. No todas las marcas admiten que contienen nicotina, pero esta se detecta en la mayoría de unidades analizadas. El e-cig contiene habitualmente propelentes como el propilenglicol, que es un producto irritante pulmonar. El efecto respiratorio a corto plazo del vapor de un e-cig es similar al causado por el humo del cigarrillo y es causa de broncoconstricción. La mayoría de marcas contienen glicerina, y se ha detectado al menos un caso de neumonía lipoidea por esta sustancia. Muchas marcas contienen trazas de N-nitrosaminas, metales pesados y otros productos que se encuentran en el humo de los cigarrillos convencionales en mucha mayor proporción. Actualmente no se dispone de evidencia científica de que sea un dispositivo eficaz para dejar de fumar, por lo que no debe recomendarse de forma proactiva para este fin y puede interferir en el uso de tratamientos de evidencia científica demostrada para dejar de fumar. Puede tener un efecto indeseable al promover el inicio del consumo en adolescentes o retener a fumadores adultos en el consumo de nicotina y en la dependencia gestual. No se conoce bien la toxicidad de los vapores pero se sabe que no son inocuos, por lo que no deberían utilizarse en espacios públicos cerrados. The electronic cigarette (e-cig) is a device with a conventional cigarette shape that releases a determined dose of nicotine vapour through an electronic heating process. The nicotine cartridges vary significantly in the amount of nicotine released, even within the same brand. Not all brands admit that they contain nicotine, but this is detected in the majority of units analysed. The e-cig usually contains a propellant, such as propylene glycol, which is a lung irritant. The short-term respiratory effect of the vapour of an e-cig is similar to that caused by the smoke of a cigarette, and is a cause of broncho-restriction. The majority of brands contain glycerine and at least one case of lipoid pneumonia has been detected due to this substance. Many brands contain traces of N-nitrosamines, heavy metals, and other products that are found in conventional cigarette smoke, but in a much higher proportion. There is currently no scientific evidence available that shows it is an effective device for quitting smoking, thus it should not be pro-actively recommended for this purpose, and may interfere with the use of demonstrated scientific evidence-based treatments for quitting smoking. It may have an undesirable effect on promoting the starting of smoking in adolescents or keeping adult smokers consuming nicotine and on gestural dependency. The toxicity of the vapour is not well known, but it is known that they are not innocuous, thus they should not be used in closed public spaces.",

      "title": "Efectos del consumo de alcohol en la adolescencia sobre los procesos de aprendizaje y memoria dependientes del hipocampo: administración intermitente-excesiva vs. Crónico-moderada",
      "abstract": "El alcohol es la droga de abuso mas consumida a nivel mundial, siendo ademas este consumo el de inicio mas precoz. Se ha demostrado que la adolescencia es una etapa especialmente vulnerable a los efectos del alcohol y, en las ultimas decadas, ha surgido entre la poblacion mas joven un nuevo patron de ingesta de alcohol, llamado binge drinking, que consiste en el consumo intermitente y de grandes cantidades de esta droga en un breve periodo de tiempo. Por ello, en este trabajo, utilizando un modelo animal de autoadministracion y otro de administracion intraperitoneal, ambos durante la adolescencia, se ha evaluado si el patron de consumo de alcohol (cronico-moderado vs. intermitente-excesivo) es un factor relevante en los efectos de esta droga sobre los procesos de aprendizaje y memoria espacial dependientes del hipocampo, asi como sobre los mecanismos plasticos subyacentes, la expresion de diferentes proteinas hipocampales y la supervivencia neuronal. Nuestros resultados revelan que ambas formas de consumo provocan el deterioro del aprendizaje y la memoria espacial, y que, en el caso del consumo intermitente-excesivo, los efectos son dependientes de la dosis. Por otro lado, el consumo intermitente-excesivo de alcohol produce alteraciones en la plasticidad sinaptica hipocampal, en concreto inhibiendo la depresion a largo plazo (LTD) y cambios en la proporcion de las subunidades de los principales receptores AMPA hipocampales (GluA1/2 y GluA2/3), mientras que la administracion cronico-moderada induce principalmente cambios en la expresion genica y proteica de la mayoria de las subunidades de los receptores NMDA y un desequilibrio en la proporcion de receptores AMPA. En ambos tipos de administracion, se observa un aumento en la fosforilacion de la proteina glucogeno sintasa quinasa 3 beta (GSK3β) en Ser9, mecanismo de inactivacion de esta quinasa, que correlaciona positivamente con el deterioro de la memoria espacial encontrado, es decir, a mayor inactivacion de esta quinasa, mayor deficit de memoria espacial. Por otro lado, en este trabajo tambien se ha estudiado el fosfoproteoma hipocampal y se ha demostrado que la administracion no contingente de una unica dosis de alcohol, durante la adolescencia, disminuye la fosforilacion de algunas proteinas (PSA3, GLNA y SODm) en el hipocampo. Al estudiar los patrones de consumo, se observo que la administracion cronico-moderada reduce la expresion de la mayoria de proteinas identificadas (como GBB1, NAPG, COPS6 y LDH-B), mientras que la intermitente-excesiva las aumenta, independientemente de la dosis (MDH1, PSMA2, ARPC2, SODm, PPIA, entre otras). Casi todas las proteinas que sufrieron cambios por la administracion de alcohol, ya fuese de manera aguda, cronica o intermitente, estan relacionadas con procesos de neurodegeneracion y neuroproteccion. En conclusion, los efectos del consumo de alcohol en la adolescencia sobre los procesos hipocampales son dependientes del patron de consumo y, cuando este es intermitente, la dosis administrada se convierte en un factor clave. Ademas, el nivel de activacion de GSK3β parece ser un buen biomarcador del dano hipocampal provocado por esta droga.",

      "title": "The ‘Not-a-Puff’ rule",
      "abstract": "The ‘not-a-puff’ rule involves assisting smokers to stop smoking abruptly, commit to not smoking any further cigarettes after the quit date and also to promise to not taking even a single puff on a cigarette from that day forwards. This briefing provides the rationale and the theoretical and empirical evidence behind this clinical intervention. The traditional definition of a four-week quit used for stop smoking service returns to the Department of Health is ‘continuous abstinence from smoking from day 14 to the four-week follow-up point’. This means that occasional smoking is permitted in the first two weeks of the quit attempt but should NOT be interpreted clinically that this is a strategy that is encouraged. Better long-term results are obtained from abrupt cessation and adoption of the ‘not-a-puff’ rule. Continued smoking following the quit date prevents resolution of the neuroadaptive changes in the brain that take place upon quitting and leads to prolonged withdrawal symptoms. The ‘habit’ element of smoking is not broken whilst a smoker continues to have occasional puffs. Smoking following the quit date reduces the client’s self-efficacy, which only increases through\r\ncontinued abstinence. Self-control, also valuable in quitting, is similarly related to the length of time a client abstains and will not build up if the client continues to smoke. Empirical studies have shown that lapses are commonly followed by relapses, in up to 95%\r\nof cases. The ‘not-a-puff’ rule is associated with better outcomes than gradual cessation, in both supported\r\nand unsupported quit attempts. Harm reduction, where continued smoking is permitted with concomitant use of pharmacotherapy (i.e. nicotine replacement therapy; NRT) to reduce consumption, can be recommended for smokers\r\nwho are unwilling or unable to stop.",

      "title": "Ecstasy/MDMA Perceived Risk by Late Adolescents and Early Adults",
      "abstract": "Ecstasy/MDMA is usually lumped with “club drugs” which is where ecstasy is more likely to be prevalent since it comes in hand with EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and other club music and is advertised as “Molly” to be a pure form of ecstasy which is very hard to know if it contains any MDMA at all. According to a study conducted by Johnston et al., the individual’s perceived risk and harmfulness of the drug determine usage. Risk was observed during a period of time and it can be alarming when perceived risk drops because it can have unpredictable effects on new population using ecstasy/MDMA. One of the highest predictors found if a young adult would participate in the use of ecstasy is the association with other ecstasy users and the types of events attended.\r\nPopularity of ecstasy/MDMA does not have a consistent measure of popularity since it is often changing and each risk perceived is effective to drops in popularity as well as when the risk is not seen as a big issue. During a longitudinal study Johnston et al. was able to see that while one year of high school students could have negative perceptions of a drug others could be exempt and would affect just those years of students.\r\nOne popular predictor found by Smirnov et al. was that much ecstasy use occurred under a specific type of music culture which was mainly electronic music and dance music in clubs as opposed to a diminished amount in places where there was live music. This shows that the social environment has a deep influence on the frequency that the drug is offered on individuals. This is because the basic perception of the drug is associated to be part of the electronic music scene.",

      "abstract": "Selective eating, faddiness or 'picky' eating is a common behavioural problem in young children. It is often transient and short-lived, with food preferences altering every few weeks or lasting for a few months at most. Severe selective eating in young children is not well described in the clinical literature as it does not fit into existing diagnostic categories. It is often included in general samples of children treated as food refusers. In a large British retrospective population study, 4% of 5-year-olds were described as being 'faddy' by their parents. There was an equal prevalence in boys and girls. Around 30% of the faddy eaters had feeding problems as a baby. Parents frequently report early onset under the age of 2 years in pre-school children. Severe selective eating exists in the adult population but it is not clear whether this originated in early childhood or infancy.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: O consumo de substâncias psicoativas e uma caracteristica comum nas populacoes da maioria dos paises, inclusive as do Brasil, sendo o tabaco e o alcool as mais utilizadas. Muitas variaveis (ambientais, biologicas, psicologicas e sociais) atuam simultaneamente para influenciar a tendencia de qualquer pessoa vir a usar drogas e isto se deve a interacao entre o agente (a droga),o sujeito (o individuo e a sociedade) e o meio (os contextos socio-economico e cultural). O crack e uma das principais causas de busca de atendimento entre usuarios de drogas ilicitas, e uma droga com fortes propriedades estimulantes e que mais motiva o usuario a buscar tratamento, ainda que nao seja mais consumida, revela o impacto pessoal familiar dessa dependencia. Sua utilizacao produz uma euforia de grande magnitude e de curta duracao, seguida de intensa fissura e desejo de repetir a dose. O grupo iniciante consumidor da droga possui um perfil jovial. Em estudo realizado no municipio de Sao Paulo, detectou que aumentou o numero de usuarios a partir de 1989, com isso os servicos ambulatoriais comecaram a sentir o impacto do crescimento do consumo. Atualmente, o tratamento prioriza a desintoxicacao, a reducao de danos e o retorno ao convivio social. Objetivo: Conhecer as demandas da mulher usuaria de droga em tratamento de servico de saude mental. Metodo: Trata-se de um caso clinico, desenvolvido em um Centro de Atencao Psicossocial alcool e drogas, localizado no municipio de Fortaleza, Ceara, com uma mulher em uso abusivo de drogas psicoativas, com 28 anos, solteira, em situacao de rua por dois anos. Os dados foram coletados atraves da tecnica de entrevista durante uma consulta de enfermagem, seguindo-se um roteiro semiestruturado contendo perguntas fechadas e abertas. Resultados: no discurso da participante destacaram-se aspectos como a vulnerabilidade social da mulher usuaria de drogas, a vivencia de violencia psicologica e fisica, a prostituicao para a aquisicao de drogas, a exposicao em virtude da situacao de moradia de rua, prostituicao, as dificuldades no acesso ao tratamento da dependencia quimica, o preconceito relacionado ao fato de ser usuaria de psicoativos e a falta de abordagem das questoes de genero por parte dos profissionais do servico de saude. Conclusao: Foi perceptivel o fato de que as caracteristicas sociodemograficas da participante a tornaram vulneravel ao uso de drogas, as dificuldades em acessar e permanecer no tratamento em servico especializado. O abuso das mais variadas substâncias (alcool, tabaco, cocaina, maconha, crack e psicotropicos) trouxe varias demandas para o cuidado da participante, relacionados com prejuizos sociais (moradia de rua, desemprego), legais (detencoes), interpessoais (conflitos familiares) e de saude (doencas sexualmente transmissiveis, aborto e acidentes). Ressalta-se a importância no tratamento de casos de dependencia quimica e a adaptacao do mesmo as especificidades da mulher.",

      "abstract": "Objective: A case report of carrot addiction is presented with a review of the literature and comment on the role of beta carotene in addictive behaviour. Clinical Picture: The addiction occurred in a 49-year-old woman under conditions of stress due to marital problems, leading to a depressive illness and increased smoking. The patient maintained that the sensations of carrot craving and withdrawal were quite distinct from those associated with smoking. Treatment: The patient was advised to record her daily carrot consumption. Outcome: The patient did not return for several months, but stopped eating carrots after an operation, at which time she also stopped smoking. Conclusion: Compusive carrot eating, regarded as a rare condition, has received scant documentation, unlike hypercarotenemia due to unusual diets or food fads. Nervousness, craving, insomnia, waterbrash and irritability are associated with withdrawal from excessive carrot eating. The basis for the addiction is believed to be beta carotene, found in carrots. Does carrot eating, an aggressively oral activity, merely act as a behavioural substitute for smoking? Or does beta carotene contain a chemical element that replicates the addictive component of nicotine? Further study of this unusual but intriguing addiction may reveal more about the basis of all addictions, with particular implications for the cessation of cigarette smoking.",

      "title": "Alcohol consumption among adolescents in the City of Zagreb and the presence of alcohol drinking among their parents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAdolescence is a period in which majority of youth first come into contact with psychoactive substances. For some, this contact is ephemeral and without major consequences, while for others it can be fatal and lead to a complete change of lifestyle and development of addiction. Alcohol is a psychoactive substance that most adolescents consume. This is, besides its legality and availability, due to its eternal presence and incorporation into lifestyle and customs. Adolescents are not attracted by alcohol only because of the identification with the lifestyle of adults, but also as a means to temporarily take away the anxiety associated with feelings of being lost and confused in their current life phase. Alcohol consumption in adolescence is usually characterized with daily need for drinking, and often, intensive drinking on weekends. Experimenting with addictive substances among youth is usually motivated with curiosity, a desire for self-affirmation, imitation and self-assertion. As with adults, alcohol consumption among young people can stimulate and/or be accompanied by a number of other psychiatric disorders.1 With adolescents prone to alcohol use and general psychoactive substances, we can frequently observe behavior disorders, origins of antisocial and borderline personality disorder and mood disorders. These disorders may induce the use of psychoactive substances and lead to a behavioral model characterized by impulsivity, self destructive tendencies and disregard for the consequences of their actions.2-5Previous studies have suggested a number of factors that influence the use of psychoactive substances, such as the structure of adolescent personality, family dynamics, genetics and neurochemical and social factors. Due to the complex interaction of these factors it is difficult to determine the hierarchy of their importance in the development and preferences to alcohol consumption.6-9 Considering the important, if not the most important role that family has in the formation of identity in adolescence10 it is to be expected that the family functioning would be associated with general psychic adjustment of adolescents, their perception of self-esteem, a sense of competence, school achievement and behavioral disorders - delinquent behavior and use of addictive substances.11-13Early psychoanalytic theories made reference to oral regression and the similarity of the phenomenon of addiction with the earliest stage of libidinal development, when the child demands gratification of its desires without any ability to give. Addictive behavior is understood as a narcissistic phenomenon of obsession with achieving personal satisfaction. Recent theories describe dysfunction of the ego, the inability of processing painful and unpleasant feelings related to early object relations, while the cognitive approach attempts to identify negative models of thought related with the experience of adolescent identity confusion, lifestyle, projections of their future, relationship with their parents and peers, with the inability to develop different cognitive schemes. Some studies have shown that, among adolescents who are prone to consuming psychoactive substances the traits of pessimism, impulsiveness, auto-aggression and low self-esteem are more accentuated.2'4SUBJECTS AND METHODSThis study was conducted on 701 high school students in Zagreb during the school year 2011/2012. Selection included 13 general secondary school classes and 18 vocational high school classes. In each school, students engaged in the study came from 1st to 4th grade or, for vocational schools, 1st to 3rd grade. After attaining a written permission of the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports, the directors of schools in which the study was conducted were informed on the implementation of research and parents of students in selected classes were sent a notification in which the objectives, methods and modus of research were briefly explained. …",

Even most people addicted to the weed are willing to admit that it is bad for your health, but that they have decided to smoke it anyway for a surprisingly wide variety of reasons. Needless to say, nonsmokers do not usually find any of these reasons compelling, or even rational, given the evidence that inexorably links smoking to multiple causes of morbidity and premature mortality. Were it not for the truly enormous public health costs, and the intrusive nature of smoke on other people’s airspace, non-smokers would probably merely pity their deluded smoking brethren. Even allowing for the addictive properties of tobacco, non-smokers tend to think that the only plausible explanation for smoking is that smokers simply do not believe that any of the adverse consequences are going to happen to them: a position of faith, which is often rapidly abandoned (albeit too late in many cases) when the worst happens.

      "abstract": "Enteral tube feeding (ETF) and parenteral nutrition (PN) are unphysiological methods of feeding. They may not elicit the cephalic phase response because part or all of the gastrointestinal tract is bypassed, nutrients are typically given in liquid form by a continuous infusion over many hours and often overnight while patients sleep. Work conducted in animals, healthy subjects and patients suggests that nutrients delivered as ETF or PN are less effective in relieving appetite sensations than food intake. Distressing appetite sensations may even occur despite the provision by artificial nutrition of sufficient nutrients to meet requirements. The energy provided by ETF and PN is largely additional to oral food intake in humans eating ad libitum, although the extent to which this occurs may decrease with time. There is a need to establish ways (e.g. nutritional, pharmacological, psychological) to suppress appetite sensations and food intake when eating is contraindicated, and to enhance them when weaning from artificial nutrition is desirable.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is a substance that is found naturally in many plants and is often found in many of the drinks and foods we consume. The widespread use of caffeine is continually on the rise as we can easily find caffeine in coffee, tea, soda, chocolate, energy drinks and gels, gum, and pharmaceutical drugs. Caffeine is recognized as the World’s most commonly used drug and is frequently used by athletes as a nutritional ergogenic aid during training and competition. Caffeine is often administered as a liquid or in a capsule, but new research has shown that caffeine gum has a faster absorption rate and a higher relative bioavailability. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of different dosages caffeine gum ingestion on blood lactate and glucose during 1500-m running. Fifteen well-trained male runners completed a doubleblind, placebo controlled experiment. The runners [mean±SD] weight, height, age, and percentage body fat were 64.7±4.91 kg, 174.5±2.73 cm, 21.7±4.76 years, and 13.7±5.08 %, respectively. Chewing gum [3,4,5 mg.kg-1 of caffeine] or a placebo was administered at three time points [Thirty-five minutes pre-exercise, 5 minutes pre-exercise, and immediately following exercise]. The participants were instructed to chew for five minutes. Participants raced 1500-m distance. Blood glucose and lactate were measured via a finger prick in any four stages, 5 minutes pre-1500-m running, and immediately following 1500-m running. The rest Interval between any measurement stages was one week. The results indicated no significantly different between that blood glucose [p<0.05] and blood lactate [p<0.05] levels over time with the different dosages caffeine and versus the placebo. This was one of the first exercise studies conducted that administered caffeine gum and should be used as a starting point for future research on caffeine gum and exercise.",

      "title": "Can regular physical activity prevent obesity? Part 1: Potential factors reducing the efficacy of physical activity.",
      "abstract": "Objective. The objective of this narrative review is to consider possible factors limiting the efficacy of regular physical activity as a means of preventing the development of obesity and/or treating established accumulations of body fat. Methods. Information obtained from Ovid/Medline and Google Scholar through to December 2018 was supplemented by a search of the author's extensive personal files. Results. In the early years of human history, humans probably evolved mechanisms to reduce energy expenditures during periods of severe food shortage. Adaptations could have included a decrease in resting energy expenditures and/or the temporary elimination of all except essential physical activities. However, it is less certain that such mechanisms operate when a person who has an excess of body fat conforms to rigid dietary restrictions and/or undertakes a rigorous exercise programme. Severe dieting may indeed lead to some reduction of resting metabolism, but such effects are commonly attenuated if not fully reversed by the inclusion of an exercise programmes that conserve lean tissue mass. There is also little evidence that exercise programmes stimulate appetite or reduce spontaneous leisure activity. Conclusions. An excess of adipose tissue is usually accumulated over several years. If one views the prevention and/or correction of obesity by an increase of physical activity as a similar long-term project, the required exercise is within the capacity of those who are overweight. There is no good reason why a well-designed exercise programme cannot optimize body composition, as well as offering other important health benefits; however, as with rigorous dieting, the challenge to health professionals is to sustain enthusiasm until this has been accomplished.",

      "title": "Licorice abuse: time to send a warning message",
      "abstract": "Licorice extract has always been recognized as a sweetener and a thirst quencher. Its nutritive value is overrated by many who consume significant amounts and are prone to complications. Glycyrrhetic acid, the active metabolite in licorice, inhibits the enzyme 11-ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme type 2 with a resultant cortisol-induced mineralocorticoid effect and the tendency towards the elevation of sodium and reduction of potassium levels. This aldosterone-like action is the fundamental basis for understanding its health benefits and the wide spectrum of adverse effects. Herein, we present a comprehensive review of licorice along with the reported complications related to excess intake. Despite its apparent use in a few clinical scenarios, the daily consumption of licorice is never justified because its benefits are minor compared to the adverse outcomes of chronic consumption. The review highlights the importance of investigating the dietary habits and herbal remedies which are being used worldwide on cultural and habitual bases rather than reliable scientific evidence. Licorice is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved food supplement used in many products without precise regulations to prevent toxicity. Increased awareness among the public is required through TV commercials, newspapers, internet sites, magazines and product labels regarding the upper limit of ingestion and health hazards associated with excess intake. We hope that this review will serve as a warning message that should be transmitted from physicians to patients to avoid excessive licorice intake as well as a message to the FDA to start regulating the use of this substance.",

      "abstract": "Results Nine scenarios were found where clinical messages might improve diabetes management. Appointment Reminders. Appointments, previsit lab draws, and preventative health tasks (quarterly diabetes visits, yearly ophthamological referral) were often forgotten. Medication Reminders. Patients desire reminders for medication refills, and for taking medicines at certain times of the day. Medication Dosage Changes. Patients benefit from follow up on medicine changes, as they may become noncompliant and not tell the team. Medication Dosing Clarification. Patients sometimes misdose due to communication errors (e.g. once a interpreted as 11 tablets a day) or space medication doses improperly. Blood Glucose Testing Reinforcement. Patients forget agreements with their provider to check their blood sugar at certain times of the day. Meal Time Reinforcement. Some patients have difficulty remembering meal and snack times. Exercise Reinforcement. Patients desire reminders up to twice a day to make time for the activities they enjoy (walks, Tai Chi, etc). Dietary Reinforcement. Some patients desire reinforcement to eat less, to decrease soft drink and/or juice consumption, to eat healthier, or to drink more water. General Information. Patients desire timely access to health care information, including lab results, medication recalls, preventative health information (influenza vaccination reminders), and availability of new medications/devices for diabetes management. Discussion Patients in the pilot study enjoyed receiving messages. We learned that: Messages should be coalesced if tenmorally close. Patients preferred a single message for all tasks to be performed within a 30 minute block. Communications should be customized. Patients do not need reminders for what they already do. Monitoring patient responses is important. The system should be able to identify critical responses, so that actions can be taken quickly. Constant reminders train patients. Patients start predicting when the pages will come, and they remember what they need to do. Wireless technology is not ubiquitous. This intervention can only be used where wireless service is provided reliably. Reliability is important. Patients noticed missed messages, and failures despite reason (software issues, network freezes, patients out of service area) reflected upon the messaging system.",

Although GHB is often defined as a ‘party drug’, particularly in rural areas it is also used in street cultures. GHB is mainly used recreationally, but a minority uses the drug frequently and/or becomes addicted. GHB use and associated problems are disproportionately spread across the Netherlands and are concentrated in certain rural areas (‘trouble spots’), especially in low SES villages or neighbourhoods. Predominantly based on qualitative research, this article describes supply and use of GHB in rural ‘trouble spots’. The profile of experienced current GHB users in rural areas is characterized by a wide age range, a low level of education, often multiple psychosocial problems and poly drug use. They are almost exclusively ‘white’, in majority male users, of whom a large part has been arrested on several occasions. From a supply perspective, GHB could spread quickly because of the short distribution chain, the limited social distance between dealers and users, as well as the closeness an reticence of user groups. Even though as a drug GHB is very different from methamphetamine, there are striking similarities in set and setting characteristics between rural GHB use in the Netherlands and rural methamphetamine use in the US.",

      "abstract": "A new product which is an electronic cigarette acting as nicotine delivery has been marketed at early 2000s. An electronic cigarette generates nicotine aerosol from a solution comprised of several basic substances, nicotine and flavours. The electronic cigarettes were widely promoted by a manufacturer like a safe product substituting tobacco smoking during quitting period. As a result, their consumption has been increasing progressively worldwide. Investigators of the aerosol content reported that it mainly contains ultrafine particles which easily penetrate into alveoli and blood vessels. The aerosol also contains nitrosamines, toxic substances and heavy metals. Strong evidence has been made about the aerosol cytotoxicity that could lead to serious injury and diseases. Nicotine dependence was demonstrated to develop as a result of an electronic cigarette smoking. While smoking an electronic cigarette, the indoor air concentration of toxic substances could reach hazardous levels. Electronic cigarettes do not have any advantage and cannot be considered as a mean to quit tobacco smoking. Moreover, electronic cigarette consumers were shown to quit smoking significantly harder. A large body of scientific confirmation of hazardous effect of electronic cigarettes on a human either during active or passive smoking have been obtained. It is no doubt that further investigations are needed especially with regards to rapid change in the market of electronic cigarettes. To minimize adverse effect of electronic cigarettes both on an individual and on population at whole certain measures should be undertaken intended to limitation of demand and supply of electronic cigarettes in the country similar to those for typical tobacco products.",

      "title": "Inactive pharmaceutical ingredients : implications for pregnancy.",
      "abstract": "dministration of pharmaceutical agents to pregnant women is a concern, because of safety issues to both mother and fetus. However, all medication formulations contain many other inactive ingredients in addition to the active drug. In contrast to the extensive research on the safety of active pharmaceutical ingredients in pregnant patients, the fetal safety of the inactive ingredients has been largely ignored. This is likely due to the fact that the inactive ingredients are considered to be in “small amounts” and are believed to be “inert”. However, this is often not the case. Most pharmaceutical preparations will typically contain 5 to 10 times more inactive ingredients in terms of weight versus the actual active ingredients. Therefore, most tablets, for example, are mainly made up of inactive ingredients. It is common for a medicine to have a dozen or so inactive ingredients within its formulation acting as lubricants, fillers, binders, disintegrating agents, stabilizers or silica flow conditioners. Also, there are numerous oral liquid or syrup drugs that contain 15-20% of ethanol, the most widespread human teratogen. For instance, a patient taking 2 teaspoons of Choledyl elixir 4 times daily will absorb 8g of alcohol. This is equal to the amount of ethanol in one bottle of beer. The Kaletra (oral solution of lopinavir /ritonavir) contains a surprising 42.4% of ethanol (Table 1). As this review highlights, many chemicals that are commonly used as inactive ingredients in drugs have adverse effects on reproductions. These inactive ingredients have been described in variety of models, and most often the NoObserved-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) in humans has not yet been established. Given these examples, a manufacturer should employ a great deal of prudence while formulating drugs that contain ethanol or other unstudied alcohols destined to be consumed by pregnant women. Hence, it seems logical that rather than risking fetal safety, the use of such compounds as inactive ingredients should be restricted or banned. We propose that to study the safety of medications in pregnancy, one should apply the principles of teratology not only to the active ingredients, but also to the ingredients termed in-active. The basic principles of evaluating teratogenic potential have been articulated by scores of different authors and include the following: 1. Biological plausibility for teratogenic potential, including mechanism of action, periods of greatest sensitivity, and genetic susceptibility. 2. Analysis of dose-response relationships and pharmacokinetics in an animal model and in humans. 3. Analysis and interpretation of human epidemiologic studies. 4. The examination of the relationship between the secular trend of birth defects and the population exposure to drugs.",

      "abstract": "Toluene is a commonly used volatile organic chemical in industry and is the most often chosen illicit substance among volatile substance abusers. Studies involving healthy volunteers suggest that ethanol consumption inhibits toluene metabolism, thus increasing its blood levels. In this study, a lethal case of combined ethanol consumption and toluene inhalation has been reported. Our case was a 30-year-old male who had used volatile substance for 15 years. The autopsy revealed no abnormal findings. Toxicological analysis revealed alcohol and toluene in the blood and the cause of death was considered as toxicity due to acute combined intake of alcohol and toluene. Lethal combined ethanol and toluene intake is rarely reported in the literature. Experimental studies indicate that toluene increases the risk of ethanol dependence and each substance increases the toxic effects of the other.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking may interact with the metabolism of a number of drugs. This has been demonstrated clearly in pharmacokinetic studies in animals and man. However, tobacco smoking as a variant has been studied with relatively few clinically essential drugs and these studies do not always demonstrate a consistent effect of smoking. This review therefore not only records what data have emerged from pharmacokinetic or other studies, but it also attempts to determine whether such interactions have clinical significance. The main finding of this review is that, in the majority of examples, there is little evidence that there is a recognizable hazard from the interaction per se. The exceptions to this general conclusion are limited to four drugs: insulin, propoxyphene, propranolol, and theophylline preparations. With these drugs, there is some evidence of clinical importance of an interaction with tobacco smoking.",

      "title": "Hy's law",
      "abstract": "People have been medicating themselves and poisoning each other, and vice versa, for thousands of years; however, there is no doubt that the era of greatest therapeutic misadventure thus far is currently upon us, at least in affluent developed countries. That is not to say that the concoctions of ancient pharmacopeias were safer than the drugs of today—but morbidity and mortality caused by medications,1 mostly from side effects but also because of erroneous prescription or inappropriate administration,2, 3 have created a silent epidemic of great concern to health policy makers,4 health care givers,5, 6 and even patients.7, 8 That such events occur should be no surprise, because drugs, poisons, and toxins have much in common—except, one hopes, for the \"therapeutic intent\" of the \"prescriber.\" Like medicinal potions, poisons are usually administered orally, albeit surreptitiously; in fact, the word itself derives from the Old French puison, which originally meant \"a drink\" or \"a draught,\" and later, in the 14th century, was used to refer specifically to poisonous draughts. As with drugs, poisons and toxins may also be given parenterally, usually delivered by a remotely guided missile (e.g., a dart or an arrow) but occasionally at short range on the sharpened tip of an umbrella or walking stick. The latter device is much-favored in the \"cloak and dagger\" world of international espionage, as was the case with the ricin murder of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov in 1978 on London's Waterloo Bridge, which was presumably initiated by the KGB. The word toxin is derived from the Greek word for bow (τo´ξoυ), the weapon of their oriental enemies, often used to shoot arrows tipped with poisons. Poisons may also be administered by inhalation, as occurred in the tragic poisoning with sarin gas in three Tokyo subways in 1995. In contrast, poison administration through the external ear, which was exhibited in the murder of Hamlet's father and made possible because of the common occurrence in the Middle Ages of chronic otitis media (as presumably Shakespeare knew), is a distinctly unusual practice nowadays even in the pages of Patricia Cornwell novels. It is only fair to point out that the medication–poison sequence is not a one-way street, because poisons have also been used as cures from ancient times to the present. Aureolus Phillipus Theostratus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541), immortalized as Paracelsus,9 reasoned that \"All substances are poisons; there is none which is not a poison.\" Paracelsus thought that it was dose alone that differentiated a poison from a remedy, thereby preempting by 500 years what we now refer to as true, predictable, or intrinsic hepatotoxicity.10 His dictum \"Dosis sola facit veneum\" (\"the dose alone makes the poison\") guided Paracelsus in the use of mercury to treat syphilis, for which he was denounced in his day but which nonetheless remained the therapy of choice for the next 300 years until Erlich's discovery of arsenic-derived arsphenamine (Salvarsan) in 1910.11 Many modern drugs are also derived from poisons, starting with the neuromuscular blocking agents that followed naturally from Claude Bernard's famous experiments with curare,12 the poisonous alkaloid found in the South American vine Chondrodendron tomentosum that was said to have been brought to Europe first by Sir Walter Raleigh. The host of antitumor antibiotics used in clinical oncologic practice today, all derived from \"natural\" products13, 14 (mostly plants, fungi, and bacteria), lends support to Paracelsus' hypothesis of poisons, and includes asparaginase, a bacterial enzyme; etoposide, a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin from the stems and roots of the mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum); irinotecan, isolated from the Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata; paclitaxel, a taxine originally obtained from the bark of the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia (now made synthetically); vincristine and vinblastine, vinca alkyloids from the Madagascar periwinkle Catharanthus roseus; and the anthracyclines bleomycin, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, mitomycin, and others isolated from various Streptomyces species, to name but a few. The proclivity of humans to seek cures for their ills in the worlds of nature and alchemy appears to have been as strong and universal among the ancients as it is today, judging by the content of their documents that have survived on clay tablet, papyrus, silk, and parchment from Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Europe, respectively. The Egyptian Papyrus Ebers, dating from 1500 BCE, set forth 811 prescriptions in the form of salves, plasters, and poultices; snuffs, inhalations, and gargles; and fumigations, suppositories, and enemas—all derived from minerals, plants, and so-called \"organic\" material that \"plumbs the depths of human credulity\"15 and does not bear description here. The extensive Materia Medica of Chinese medicine16 (itself predated only by the medicine of Babylon and Egypt) was well-documented (over 1200 drugs) in the centuries between 1100 BCEand 659 CE, in the Wu Shi Er Fang and the Herbals of Shennong and Tang, as was the Indian Ayurvedic System17, 18 on which the Gyu-zhi of 8th century CETibetan medicine was based. Plainly, physic in Western medicine began with the Greeks and Romans as described in the Hippocratic writings of approximately 400 BCE, and in the contributions of both the philosopher-scientist Theophrastus (approximately 300 BCE) and the peripatetic physician Dioscorides (1st century CE), as well as with Claudius Galen (131–201 CE) and his complex medicinal concoctions or \"galenicals.\" During the Dark and Middle Ages, the remedial expertise of Greco-Roman civilization was preserved in the monasteries of England, Ireland, France, and Germany but was promoted by the Arabs, as exemplified by the magnum opus of the Persian physician, philosopher, and poet Abu Ali al-Husain ibn Abdallah ibn Sina (981–1037 CE),19 who was known as Avicenna, the Prince of Physicians, in the Persian empire; and by the voluminous writings of the physician, philosopher, and rabbi Moses ben Maimon (1135–1204 CE),20 who was known as Rambam or Maimonides. It is tempting to dismiss the pharmacopeias of old simply as collections of potentially dangerous nostrums and placebos, as Voltaire hinted when he described the art of medicine as a means of \"amusing the patient while nature cures the disease.\" Despite the contemporary penchant for so-called \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" medicine, it is salutary to note that approximately 80% of the world's inhabitants still rely mainly on traditional medicines for their primary health care.21 Also, many of the important medications now in use in developed countries were discovered as a direct result of isolating the active principles from plants used in traditional medicine, which over the centuries has given us drugs used to treat malaria, pain, heart failure, dysrhythmias, hypertension, infection, depression, cancer, and, of course, constipation.22 Yet for all the apparent perspicacity of the healers and apothecaries of old, it was difficult for them to recognize the toxic effects of their remedies. Alexander the Great came close to the mark when he complained that he was \"dying from the treatment of too many doctors.\" (In truth, he probably died of alcoholic pancreatitis!) It may come as a surprise nonetheless to learn that the phenomenon of hepatitis due to drug sensitivity was not firmly established until the mid-20th century. In the Lowell Lectures delivered in Boston, Massachusetts, in March 1947,23 Himsworth felt it necessary to present the case of a 37-year-old woman suffering from thyrotoxicosis who developed a severe illness that was indistinguishable from infective hepatitis and was characterized by fever, jaundice, and hepatomegaly after a second test dose of aminothiazole was given (a transient fever caused by the first dose had been disregarded). At the time of Himsworth's practice, the hepatotoxicity of chlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g., chloroform) was recognized24 (although it had taken almost 50 years to do so25), the risk of liver and kidney necrosis caused by phosphorus and arsenic was well known,26 and the fatality of mushroom poisoning had been appreciated since the time of the Roman Empire,27 at least. It is not certain when drug hepatotoxicity was first recognized as an entity, but it may have been Bang's observation in 177428 of an association between chronic liver disease and arsenic, the use of which was fashionable then as a drug and cosmetic. During the first half of the 20th century, incidental occurrences of hepatic drug injury began to be noticed, like the first case of an idiosyncratic reaction on re-exposure in a patient who had taken cinchophen for gout,29 and the first 12 cases of drug-induced cholestasis30 when arsphenamine was still being prescribed for syphilis. During the third quarter of the 20th century, practitioners noticed that an increasing number of drugs injured the liver, and they published their observations as case reports and in small series. The distinction between intrinsic hepatotoxicity and what Hippocrates called idiosyncrasy, referring to a person's own peculiar (constitution ιδιoς (idios) one's self, συν (syn) together, κρασις (crasis) mixture) was acknowledged and the range of hepatotoxic drug reactions was extended to include cholestasis, steatosis, and even tumors. Studies on the mechanisms, prevention, and treatment of drug hepatotoxicity were initiated and monitoring and regulatory agencies were enfranchised in many countries. Yet the field lacked cohesion, systemization, and leadership until 1978, when the publication of his now landmark monograph on hepatotoxicity31 established Hyman J. Zimmerman as the doyen, guru, oracle, and high priest of that realm. Hyman Joseph Zimmerman, or \"Hy\" to all who knew him (Fig. 1), was one of the most beloved and respected members of the founding elite of hepatology in the second half of the 20th century. The twinkling eye, warm disposition, magnetic charm, signature bow tie, gravelly voice, and Edward G. Robinson–like countenance and stature made this \"Little Caesar\" of hepatotoxicity unique and always recognizable, no matter how large the gathering. Hy was born, raised, and educated in Rochester, New York, but he was given the chance to study medicine in the balmy clime of Stanford, California, as an unexpected consolation or bonus for the ethnic (Jewish) quota that precluded his admission to medical school in his oft-snowbound native city. Drafted into the army during World War II, he completed his medical studies on a reserve commission. Then, after superb training in tropical medicine that the army had arranged, and with the vision, insight, and planning that only the military mind can exercise, Hy was sent to a field hospital in France at Châlons-sur-Marne, near the venue of the Battle of the Bulge. There, while some of his superiors were engaged in their own personal evaluation of the neuropsychiatric effects of fermentations of the grape and the barley, he was free to treat and study over 300 soldiers with acute infective hepatitis, which resulted in a seminal publication32 (the second in his distinguished bibliography) and a personal commitment to hepatology. His first article on drug hepatotoxicity came just a few years later,33 to be followed by over 100 more publications on his chosen topic alone in his career. During his time in the army, he exploited his fondness for animals and his disdain for pompous authority by naming one of his dogs Colonel, which gave him the excuse to create the illusion of shouting and even cussing at a superior officer without fear of retribution. The four faces of Hy Zimmerman (July 19, 1944–July 12, 1999).Above left: Outside the 239th General Hospital at Châlons-sur-Marne during his military service in World War II in a composite picture created by his son Philip from contemporary photographs. Above right: Teaching on ward rounds. Below left: For his sayings, he was known as Chairman Hy. Below right: Hy was devoted to his wife Kitty, here shown in a photograph by Ms. Robin Megibow. Soon after leaving military service, Hy began his 50-year attachment to the Veterans' Affairs hospital system and his cherished association with the liver pathologists at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, DC. In an illustrious career that included chairmanships of departments of medicine, memberships of numerous associations and societies, service on editorial boards, and consultation for study groups, government agencies, and pharmaceutical firms, he was one of the very few Distinguished Physicians of the Veterans' Affairs system and was a recipient of the Distinguished Achievement Award of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease.34 He was a famed teacher whose many anecdotes, maxims, and epigrams were sometimes referred to as \"the sayings and aphorisms of Chairman Hy\" (Fig. 1). In Hepatotoxicity: The Adverse Effects of Drugs and Other Chemicals on the Liver,31 Hy succeeded in producing the most comprehensive catalogue of adverse drug reactions in the liver available at the time of its publication, based on facts retrieved from his almost insatiable consumption of the medical literature and drawn from his extensive experience as a consultant. His legendary astronomic memory and uncanny ability to see pattern and order among that morass of data allowed him to specify the characteristics of drug-induced liver injury and thereby to construct a classification scheme that is still valid today. Hy's scheme readily lends itself to modern mechanistic explanations using recent discoveries in cellular and molecular biology.35 While he clearly distinguished between intrinsic and idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, he also emphasized that his was an oversimplification, as there is a spectrum of adverse reactions between the the two pure extremes. Host factors can modulate the impact of intrinsic hepatotoxicities, as has been shown by the effect of high chronic alcohol consumption on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity,36 and there are growing numbers of examples. Also germane to the classification of drug hepatotoxicity was the appreciation of the many differences, especially in outcome, between hepatitic and cholestatic drug reactions. He also pointed out that drugs can cause cholestasis by a variety of mechanisms that differ depending on the intrahepatic site where the brunt of the injury falls37 (e.g., hepatocellular, hepatocanalicular, ductular cholestasis, and so forth). Perhaps more important than any of the foregoing insights was Hy's unique realization that when drug-induced hepatitic reactions cause sufficient hepatocyte injury to affect global liver function and, in particular, to cause jaundice because of impaired bilirubin transport by the liver, the hepatotoxicity of this severity is likely to lead to patient death, especially if the offending drug is not stopped.38 Stated more simply, Hy's rule was that aminotransferase elevation accompanied by bilirubin elevation (without significant alkaline phosphatase elevation) can be ominous, whereas aminotransferase elevation alone may be less specific in detecting serious injury. The importance of this simple rule was not lost on the officials of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who are naturally concerned about any drug hepatotoxicity that can lead to death. Over the years, the approval of several drugs has been refused (e.g., ibufenac, perhexiline, dilevalol, and tasosartan), other drugs have been withdrawn after approval (e.g., iproniazid, ticrynafen, benoxaprofen, trovofloxacin, bromfenac, and troglitazone), and still more bear serious warnings that limit their use, all because of hepatotoxicity.39 Although guidelines for detection of hepatotoxicity due to drugs and chemicals were discussed over 20 years ago at a Fogarty conference,40 these have not been entirely satisfactory in striking the balance between the overconservative approach, in which patients may be deprived of an important and relatively safe drug, and the other end of the spectrum, in which severe liver injury is discovered only after a drug has been approved and marketed. With this dilemma in mind, Dr. Robert Temple, Director for Medical Policy at The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the FDA, concluded long ago that Hy's simple prediction about the outcome of jaundice with hepatocellular enzyme elevation was valid and useful. Thus he elevated it to the status of a law (which he dubbed \"Hy's Law\") under which the FDA has been operating to a great degree for many years.39 Clearly this practice is somewhat arbitrary, and modifications will be needed to enhance specificity and sensitivity and to ensure validity. It is hoped that this will be achieved by the recently funded NIH National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases–sponsored multicenter \"Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network.\" In addition to his prowess and preeminence as a physician, clinical scientist, mentor, role model and communicator, Hy Zimmerman was above all a devoted family man. The consummate husband of Kitty, who predeceased him by 10 years, and forever changed by the passing of his son Robert in 1993, he remained an adored father to his three other children. He lived to complete the writing and see the proposed cover of the much-awaited second edition of his book,41 which was published 2 months after his death. How much better can we summarize Hy's achievements than to paraphrase Winston Churchill's famous comment* on the Soviet Union's intended actions in the very war that guided Hy toward a career in liver disease: \"A landmark law wrapped in a landmark book inside a landmark human being.\" The author acknowledges the generous cooperation of Diane Zimmerman and her brothers Philip and David for reminiscences and photographs of their father. Thanks to John R. Senior of the Office of Pharmacoepidemiology and Statistical Science of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for his insight into the significance of Hy's Law. Thanks also to Zachary Goodman for help with the photographs and to Dr. Leonard Seeff for his very personal recollections as a disciple and close friend of Hy. Finally, the author continues to acknowledge Margie Myers for her literature retrieval and manuscript preparation skills, and time spent beyond the call of duty.",

      "title": "Is there a role for e-cigarettes in smoking cessation?",
      "abstract": "The use of e-cigarettes has dramatically increased over the past few years and their role in smoking cessation remains controversial. Several clinical studies have evaluated their efficacy in smoking cessation but most of them are prospective cohort studies. Only two randomized, controlled trials have compared e-cigarettes versus placebo or patches. A meta-analysis of these two randomized, controlled trials has been performed. Nicotine-containing e-cigarettes appear to help smokers unable to stop smoking altogether to reduce their cigarette consumption when compared with placebo. However, these results are rated ‘low’ by GRADE standards. Many cohort studies have been conducted, with contradictory results. For some, e-cigarettes could increase the risk of nonsmokers developing nicotine dependence and of current smokers maintaining their dependence. The debate remains open and more randomized trials are needed with long-term data about the efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes.",

      "title": "Risks of Attempting to Regulate Nicotine Flux in Electronic Cigarettes",
      "abstract": "In their recent analysis, Shihadeh and Eissenberg1 support that by regulating nicotine flux in electronic cigarettes (ECs) could be a valuable tool in the regulatory process that would increase effectiveness and reduce the chance for abuse liability. Herein, we present the view that such a regulation could endanger the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as smoking substitutes.\r\n\r\nNicotine Delivery From Tobacco Cigarettes\r\nAlthough tobacco cigarettes deliver 1–3mg of nicotine (from about 14mg in each rod), the levels of daily nicotine intake may vary considerably between users. This is partly attributed to a substantial variability in nicotine intake per cigarette caused by different smoking intensity.2 It is also possible to smoke more than one cigarette consecutively, further avoiding the limitation of the tobacco cigarette rod standardized design. Therefore, smokers can adjust cigarette use based on personal needs, while it is extremely unlikely for smoking to cause nicotine intoxication or overdose.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicotine Delivery From ECs\r\nElectronic cigarettes differ remarkably from tobacco cigarettes in terms of nicotine delivery. There is no standardized unit of consumption. Consumers usually report their daily consumption in milliliters of liquid,3 which cannot be directly compared with daily cigarette consumption. The variability in equipment design and potential, and the range of nicotine content in EC liquids provide consumers with the ability to adjust use patterns and nicotine intake. Surveys of dedicated EC users (which were all former smokers) have shown that high nicotine levels are important especially for the initiation of EC use.3,4 Although nicotine delivery to the aerosol can be similar or higher than tobacco cigarettes,5,6 clinical studies of EC use have shown that the nicotine absorption potential is significantly lower compared with tobacco cigarettes, even when new generation devices are used.7 This is mostly attributed to the low speed of nicotine absorption, and clearly indicates that nicotine intoxication is highly unlikely when ECs are used as intended. Therefore, despite the ability to adjust use patterns, ECs are currently not as efficient as tobacco cigarettes in nicotine delivery.\r\n\r\nWe propose that the comparison between ECs and tobacco cigarettes would be similar to comparing, respectively a car with a large selection of powerful (in selected cases) engines (i.e., nicotine delivery to the aerosol) but very heavy structure (i.e., reduced rate of absorption for a given nicotine content per puff), with a car with less variability and lower-powered engines but very lightweight structure. With current technology, overall performance (i.e., nicotine delivery to the bloodstream) is definitely in favor of the tobacco cigarette, and smokers may be unable to adequately satisfy their nicotine cravings with EC use despite the ability to adjust use patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pleasure Factor in EC Use\r\nIt is physiologically plausible to support that nicotine induces pleasure and reduces anxiety in smokers.8 The pleasure factor has been largely neglected and marginalized by the tobacco control movement which is usually following the pathology paradigm framework for nicotine use.9 Perceived pleasure should not be a reason for anyone to initiate smoking (due to exposure to known risks for health damage) or EC use (due to exposure to yet unknown, although evidently much lower than smoking, risk). However, it should be considered and evaluated when discussing about smoking substitution. Surveys indicate that pleasure could be a potential reason for smokers to choose and maintain long-term EC use.3,10 This is probably one of the main reasons for the enormous variability of different flavors available in EC liquids,10 and could explain the variability of devices with different characteristics, design, and properties. The recent development and marketing of atomizers with adjustable airflow probably reflects the different preferences by users, and the effort of manufacturers to create products which can be customized based on self-preference. Since the main objective should always be elimination of smoking, the pleasure effect could be an advantage of ECs over other products which should be welcomed if it contributes to smoking reduction or cessation. Further studies are needed to examine this aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs There a Need to Regulate Nicotine Flux in ECs?\r\nBased on the evidence presented above, and with current technological evolution, it is our opinion that regulating nicotine flux in ECs, in terms of restricting usage patterns (e.g., restrict puff duration or apply a minimum interpuff interval), is unnecessary. It carries the potential risk of reducing ECs’ efficacy as smoking substitutes, while it provides no benefit in terms of safety. There is already the example of regulatory decisions by the European Union, which defined an upper limit of 20mg/ml nicotine concentration in EC liquids (http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/dir_201440_en.pdf) based on information about potential nicotine delivery to the aerosol.6 They failed to recognize that both effectiveness and abuse liability are determined by nicotine absorption (speed and amount delivered to the blood stream) rather than nicotine delivery to the aerosol. As a result, it is possible that such a restriction could exclude some smokers from effectively using ECs as smoking substitutes.\r\n\r\nResearch on nicotine flux could become an essential tool in the development of more effective EC products and in informing consumers about the characteristics of each device so that they make appropriate choices. There are two options for ECs development: (a) using higher nicotine concentration in liquid and (b) improving the absorption rate. The former results in intense (and, for many users, unbearable) throat irritation (“throat hit”), added to the irritation induced by the humectants in the aerosol (propylene glycol and glycerol). The latter may occur from adjusting use behavior (e.g., taking longer and deeper puffs, although this may make the use tiring), adjusting power delivery (which leads to more liquid consumption and aerosol production per given puff duration) and reformulating EC liquids in order to deliver and deposit nicotine more effectively into the lungs. It is possible that improvement in nicotine delivery efficacy could make ECs more addictive. This is not a concern for smokers (who are already nicotine-dependent) but for nonsmokers who may adopt EC use. However, this raises an important ethical issue: should a product, which is probably beneficial for a part of the population (smokers), be restricted (which could result in reduced efficacy as a smoking substitute) because some other parts of the population (nonsmokers) decide to voluntarily adopt its use and expose themselves to a new (even minor) risk? Measures such as proper education, regulation of advertising, and prohibition of promotion and sales to nonsmoking youth could effectively ensure that ECs will not be used by nonsmokers without restricting their potential to substitute smoking.",

Most of today's cigarette smokers, however, use tobacco daily, at intervals of less than one hour during waking hours. Since early in the twentieth century, it has been understood that this behavior is driven largely by nicotine's pharmacological actions and has little to do with the taste of nicotine. Nicotine's role in tobacco use parallels that of morphine in the use of opium derivatives. It produces CNS reinforcing effects, tolerance and physiological dependence, pharmacological effects smokers find valuable, and pleasurable effects induced by the central actions of nicotine. Nicotine and other smoke constituents also provide sensory stimuli which become conditioned reinforcers and further strengthen tobacco self-administration.",

A responsible and occasional consumption should not pose major problems, but this is not the case. The medical effects are usually caused by their abuse, like: headaches, palpitations, insomnia, sweating, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, gastroesophageal reflux, facial numbness, bloating, tremor, diarrhea and even addiction, among others. While in the dental level, specifically on the dental enamel, the most severe impact is the erosion and the lesser impact is tooth staining, which has not yet been fully investigated, also have been described the development of hypersensitivity. A timely prevention and diagnosis are essential to minimize the damage caused by prolonged use of these products. It is essential to avoid a possible trend or “fad” associated with mixing energy drinks and alcohol and even drugs, of which they are not fully known the possible risks that could potentially cause. Due to its exponential growth it is essential to have an updated knowledge about the consumption of these beverages. The high consumption of energy drinks maintained over time is associated with negative effects at the medical and dental level. Further research is necessary to prevent, treat and rehabilitate the consequences produced by the consumption of these products.",

Although aluminium is used to treat hyperhidrosis, some worries have been raised about aluminium's role in breast cancer, breast cyst and Alzheimer's disease. The human population is exposed to aluminium from vaccines, diet, and drinking water, but the frequent use of aluminium‐based cosmetics might add additional local exposure. This paper reviews literature to determine if aluminium‐based products may pose potential harm to the body. The dermal absorption of aluminium is not widely understood. It is not yet known whether aluminium can travel from the skin to brain to cause Alzheimer's disease. Aluminium may cause gene instability, alter gene expression or enhance oxidative stress, but the carcinogenicity of aluminium has not been proved yet. Until now, epidemiological researches were based on oral information, which lacks consistency, and the results are conflicting. Future studies should target real‐life‐based long‐time exposure to antiperspirants and other aluminium‐containing cosmetics and personal care products.",

Responden dalam penelitian ini adalah empat orang yang pernah menjadi pengonsumsi minuman beralkohol namun saat ini sudah bertaubat. Peneliti melakukan wawancara secara mendalam terhadap keempat orang subjek tersebut dan mengamati perilaku mereka selama satu bulan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa ada kondisi internal maupun eksternal yang mengiringi subjek selama melalui proses taubat. Orang yang mengonsumsi minuman beralkohol serta melakukan perbuatan-perbuatan menyimpang lainnya pada tahap tertentu akan merasakan kejenuhan yang menjadi sebab utama untuk bertaubat. Rasa jenuh tersebut merupakan hidayah dari Allah yang diberikan pada orang-orang yang dikehendaki-Nya. Dukungan keluarga dan dukungan sosial serte komitmen yang kuat menjadi faktor yang penting bagi subjek agar tetap bertahan dalam proses taubat.",

      "title": "Regulation in the face of uncertainty: the evidence on electronic nicotine delivery systems (e-cigarettes)",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Tobacco smoking is the largest single preventable cause of many chronic diseases and death. Effective treatments exist; however, few smokers use them and most try to quit by themselves. Most of the tobacco cigarette's toxicity is related to the combustion process. Models of harm reduction applied to tobacco suggest that switching from inhalation of combustible products to a noncombustible nicotine delivery product would likely result in a vast reduction in tobacco-related death and illness. Currently available evidence raises no doubt that electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are by far less harmful than smoking (although probably not absolutely safe) and have the potential to be the most effective tobacco harm reduction products due to their unique property of resembling smoking and providing satisfaction to the user. A lot of controversy is surrounding e-cigs and their regulation, much of which is based on the precautionary principle. Although monitoring and further research is definitely needed, the arguments used to implement severe restrictions or bans are mostly hypothetical, weakly supported by evidence, and, in some cases, derived from mispresentation or misinterpretation of the study findings. Regulators should keep in mind that the target population is smokers who want to reduce or quit their deadly tobacco consumption. To achieve this goal, smokers should be honestly informed on the relative harmfulness of the different products. E-cigs are not tobacco products and are not used as medications. For this reason, a specific regulatory scheme is needed, separate from tobacco or medicinal products regulation. Regulation should implement specific quality criteria for products, rules for the exclusion of chemicals of reasonable concern, and appropriate testing for possible contaminants. Additionally, manufacturing standards derived from the food industry should be implemented and adjusted for specific conditions related to e-cigs. Finding the appropriate balance between safety and acceptability of use by smokers will be important in achieving the maximum public health benefit. Labeling should be specified, with warnings about exposure to skin or through ingestion and discouragement of use by nonsmokers, related to the presence of nicotine. Finally, advertising and marketing should not be banned, but appropriately regulated in order to encourage use by the intended population while avoiding use by never-smokers. E-cigs should be appealing to smokers (but not to nonsmokers), while availability and pricing should be strong competitive advantages of e-cigs relative to tobacco cigarettes. Keywords: electronic cigarettes, nicotine, smoking, tobacco harm reduction, precautionary principle, regulation",

Revisão bibliográfica: O uso do cigarro eletrônico vem aumentando, e estudos sobre seu impacto na saúde bucal vem sendo realizados. O cigarro eletrônico pode deteriorar a saúde bucal de diversas maneiras, pois eles produzem vapores nos quais contém substâncias químicas que podem levar a irritação e inflamação da cavidade oral. O uso de tal dispositivo também pode alterar a microbiota oral, a qual aumenta o risco de doenças periodontais. A redução da produção de saliva também é um fator preocupante em vista do uso do cigarro eletrônico, pois leva a xerostomia, aumentando assim o risco de cáries e infecções orais. Conclusão: As evidências presentes nos mostram que o uso de cigarro eletrônico leva a diversos efeitos adversos na saúde bucal, incluindo alterações na microbiota oral, doenças periodontais e xerostomia.

They are being aggressively marketed all over the world, are being increasingly used by smokers as well as new vapers because of its easy availability and no regulation on its sale or use. These gadgets come in nearly 250 varieties and are being frequently upgraded. Methods: The promoters of e-cigs claim that it exposes the user and persons around them to much lesser degrees of nicotine and other chemicals, which is definitely far less toxic then the cigarette smoke. It is less likely to cause the health hazards-mainly cardiovascular, cancer and lung diseases as compared with cigarettes. However, no detail study has been done to clearly show the amount of nicotine absorbed and the health hazards of these noncombustibles, toxic substances have been found to be present in e-cig vapors, but again the level is very low. Results: People are worried, that this may become a starting point, the gateway of smoking for the young generation. The youngsters are easily attracted to newer, cool things and with no regulation on its advertisements, the use among youth is definitely going up. Down the line these people just remain e-cig user or easily switch to smoking cigarettes, only the time will tell. But the likelihood of this is very high. Many are using cigarettes and e-cigarettes in tandem. Conclusions: Unlicensed, unregulated e-cigarettes fail to meet standards of safety, quality and efficacy and therefore health professionals in India, as of now, do not recommend e-cigs for quitting.",

      "abstract": "In England and Scotland, 24% of adults regularly drink over the chief medical officer’s low-risk guidelines, and 27% of drinkers in Great Britain binge drink on their heaviest drinking days.1 A recent article2 suggests 41.3% of pregnant women in the UK consume alcohol at some point during pregnancy, which can be extrapolated to a modelled estimate prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) of 3.2%.\n\nPrenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading preventable cause of intellectual and developmental disabilities in the world.3 FASDs result from PAE. The shame and stigma of drinking during pregnancy and the fear of losing their children often prevent women from honestly disclosing their usage histories with their child’s paediatrician. Keeping these ‘secrets’ about alcohol consumption makes it difficult to make a correct diagnosis in children and can lead to relapse, stress, depression, anxiety and an escalation in drinking.4 Women should not be blamed or shamed when they expose a pregnancy to alcohol or other substances.4\n\n> Hearing the words ‘Your daughter has fetal alcohol syndrome’ hit me like a tsunami. I was drowning in waves of grief, disbelief, horror and remorse. In 1984, my daughter was born full-term weighing 5 lbs 12 oz. I went home from the hospital with a small but perfectly normal baby. The first two years we experienced many delayed milestones: she crawled, walked, and talked late. Her first pediatrician used to tell me ‘there is something not quite right about her, but I just can’t put my finger on it’. That used to bother me so much because to me she was simply perfect.\n> \n> When I took her to the new doctor for her 2-year check-up, I was asked all the typical milestone questions which I answered honestly.

Among the substances that may abused are alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, sedatives, cocaine, amphetamines, and marijuana. Any adult may legally purchase some substances, whereas others are illegal for most people or are available only by prescription. Although mild or moderate substance use may be harmless and even beneficial to one’s health, substance abuse presents a host of health and safety concerns for individuals and society at large (it is associated with crime and traffic accidents, for example). Human services practitioners must be able to assess clients for substance-use disorders and have knowledge of their available treatments. These treatments include psychoeducational interventions, which are especially relevant for those substance abusers who are reluctant to engage in traditional therapies. Alcohol-related disorders are the primary focus of this chapter, although other substances will be addressed as well.",

The billion-dollar industry offers users a plethora of flavors, nicotine concentrations, e-juice combinations, and devices. While some studies suggest vaping is beneficial for certain ailments and as a smoking cessation tool, many studies report concerning health outcomes associated with vape use. Recent FDA regulations have banned certain vaping products following an increase of vaping-related lung injuries reported in 2019. Health care providers need to better understand the physiological effects of vaping-specific products and the impact of secondhand vapor. The specific aims of the present study were to understand the immediate effects on heart rate, breathing frequency, blood pressure, blood sugar, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"i1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext mathvariant=\"bold\">pO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></msub></mrow></math>, pulmonary function, and oral temperature following e-cigarette use and secondhand vapor exposure. <h3>METHODS:</h3> A total of 149 volunteers participated in this study; 76 subjects vaped mint-flavored e-cigarettes with 5% nicotine for 20 min while seated next to 73 nonvaping subjects who agreed to be exposed to the vapor.

Nonvaping subjects exposed to vapor had significantly higher oral temperature after 20 min of exposure. Blood sugar and FVC were not significantly affected by vaping or exposure to vapor. <h3>CONCLUSIONS:</h3> Vaping with mint-flavored e-cigarettes with 5% nicotine for 20 min resulted in significant immediate physiological changes. Exposure to e-cigarette vapor significantly increased oral temperature within the same amount of time.",

This may happen because the patient quits (or starts) a habit such as smoking, begins a new medicine, or develops a new symptom or illness. How can you deal with this in your analysis? The answer is that within proportional hazards analysis you can create time-dependent variables. These variables change value at a particular point in time. So, instead of having a variable such as smoking at baseline (yes/no), you create a time-dependent variable, where each subject is 0 (nonsmoker) or 1 (smoker) at a particular point of survival time.",

      "abstract": "Let's say that over the course of a longitudinal study a subject's value changes on an independent variable. This may happen because the patient quits (or starts) a habit such as smoking, begins a new medicine, or develops a new symptom or illness. How can you deal with this in your analysis? The answer is that within proportional hazards analysis you can create time-dependent variables. These variables change value at a particular point in time. So, instead of having a variable such as smoking at baseline (yes/no), you create a time-dependent variable, where each subject is 0 (nonsmoker) or 1 (smoker) at a particular point of survival time.",

      "abstract": "Avec la montee des plaintes concernant les conditions de travail, le stress, l’intensification du travail, l’angoisse de perdre son emploi et d’etre declasse, il n’est pas rare d’entendre evoquer, dans les medias et les entretiens de certains salaries, la prise de substances psychoactives (legales ou non) pour tenir le coup, etouffer les souffrances ou augmenter les performances. Pourtant il n’existe encore que peu de travaux en sociologie du travail sur le sujet . Sans doute la complexite des liens entre travail et consommation de substances psychoactives tres heterogenes (tabac, alcool, cafe, medicaments, drogues « dures » ou « douces », etc.) explique une part de cette prudence ; tout comme la volonte de ne pas participer a ce que certains percoivent comme la construction du probleme des drogues au travail dans le cadre d’un processus de disciplinarisation de la main d’œuvre. Au sein de plusieurs grandes entreprises, des campagnes de « promotion de la sante » tentent en effet d’agir sur les attitudes des salaries pour reduire les consommations de drogue, de tabac ou d’alcool comme s’il s’agissait de choix individuels sans liens avec le travail. Pourtant, il est bien difficile de dire a priori si une consommation est provoquee par le travail, le contexte personnel et prive ou la simple recherche de plaisir ! Quand des difficultes professionnelles et/ou economiques rejaillissent sur la vie privee et peuvent expliquer la recherche de petits plaisirs consolatoires a travers la consommation de stupefiants, il est delicat d’avoir une attitude moralisatrice et de « condamnation de la victime ». Comment la souffrance – egalement une construction sociale complexe – et la consommation de substances psychoactives (legales ou non) peuvent etre liees ? Les recherches epidemiologiques donnent quelques pistes, mais restent difficiles a interpreter. Il existerait des schemas collectifs tant dans la perception et la gestion du mal-etre au travail, qu’en ce qui en ce qui concerne les representations que les usages de substances psychoactives. Apres avoir rappele le cadre general d’analyse de la construction collective du stress et des consommations ainsi que les differences de genres ou entre CSP, quatre illustrations rapides a partir d’observations sociohistoriques et ethnographiques sur les ouvriers, les infirmieres hospitalieres, les policiers et les conducteurs de bus, donneront un peu de chair a cette analyse.",

      "title": "E-cigarettes: Are we renormalizing public smoking? Reversing five decades of tobacco control and revitalizing nicotine dependency in children and youth in Canada",
      "abstract": "An electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) is a battery attached to a chamber containing liquid that may (or may not) contain nicotine. The battery heats the liquid and converts it into a vapour, which is inhaled, mimicking tobacco smoking. The e-cigarette does not rely on tobacco as a source of nicotine but, rather, vaporizes a liquid for inhalation. E-liquids are often flavoured and may contain nicotine in various concentrations, although actual amounts are seldom accurately reflected in container labelling. The deleterious effects of nicotine on paediatric health are well established. The use of e-cigarettes in the paediatric age group is on the rise in Canada, as are associated nicotine poisonings. E-devices generate substantial amounts of fine particulate matter, toxins and heavy metals at levels that can exceed those observed for conventional cigarettes. Children and youth are particularly susceptible to these atomized products. Action must be taken before these devices become a more established public health hazard. Policies to denormalize tobacco smoking in society and historic reductions in tobacco consumption may be undermined by this new 'gateway' product to nicotine dependency. La cigarette électronique (vapoteuse) est une batterie fixée à un réservoir rempli d’un liquide qui peut (ou non) contenir de la nicotine. La batterie réchauffe le liquide et le convertit en vapeur, qui est inhalée afin d’imiter le tabagisme. La source de nicotine de la vapoteuse ne provient pas du tabac, mais le dispositif vaporise un liquide en vue de son inhalation. Ces e-liquides, souvent aromatisés, peuvent contenir de la nicotine sous diverses concentrations, mais leur quantité réelle est rarement bien indiquée sur l’emballage. Les effets délétères de la nicotine sur la santé sont bien établis dans le groupe d’âge pédiatrique. Le vapotage est en hausse au sein de ce groupe au Canada, de même que les intoxications à la nicotine qui y sont associées. Les vapoteuses produisent de grandes quantités de particules fines, de toxines et de métaux lourds, à des taux qui peuvent dépasser ceux de la cigarette conventionnelle. Les enfants et les adolescents sont particulièrement susceptibles à ces produits atomisés. Il faut agir avant que ces dispositifs deviennent un danger mieux établi en santé publique. Cette nouvelle « porte d’accès » à la dépendance à la nicotine pourrait saboter les politiques visant à « dénormaliser » le tabagisme dans la société, ainsi que les réductions historiques de consommation du tabac.",

It is most often consumed through smoking, placing the respiratory system in direct contact with the toxic constituents of the drug, which are similar to those of tobacco cigarettes. However, accurate study of the adverse effects of marijuana is difficult to perform, owing to marijuana’s illegal status, variation in smoking technique, often short duration of use compared with tobacco and the frequently confounding factor of concomitant consumption of both marijuana and tobacco. Despite this, there is evidence to suggest that marijuana can impair lung function, damage large airway mucosa and possibly contribute to bullous disease, while its carcinogenic potential is controversial.",

      "abstract": "Special requirements, such as super-maximally filled glycogen stores, short regeneration times, correct meal timing or appropriate weight specifications for ski jumping are particularly useful for endurance athletes such as cross-country skiers. A deficiency could have a fatal effect on performance and possibly a negative influence on health.&#x0D; While cross-country skiing is clearly one of endurance sports, ski jumping and alpine skiing are considered to be fast-strength sports or technical (acrobatic) sports.&#x0D; The proven advantages of carbohydrate loading (supercompensation), a nutritional technique for classic endurance loads, also apply to cross-country skiing.&#x0D; A drop in performance, concentration and coordination disorders as well as overheating threaten if fluid loss exceeds 2% of the total body water. Vitamin additives or sweeteners in sports drinks are inefficient. Since the higher need is actually compensated by the increased food intake with a balanced mixed diet, there is, in principle, no over-proportional need for individual vitamins in athletes.&#x0D; As the maximum oxygen uptake is already 15% lower from 3000 m altitude, a drop in performance is clearly noticeable there.&#x0D; When skiing (snowshoeing, ski touring, etc.), it should be noted that an ascent of 100 meters in altitude alone requires an additional 100–150 kcal. At moderate activity, the additional energy requirement at high altitudes compared to the sea level is estimated to be 250–290 kcal per day for men and 180–200 kcal per day for women.&#x0D; Top athletes in cross-country skiing can liberate 170–210 kJ/min (40– 50 kcal/min) in a dominant anaerobic manner within 2–3 minutes. The respective energy consumption is modified by numerous personal as well as external factors (for cross-country skiing, for example, the outside temperature, the friction resistance of the snow, the technique, the height profile of the route and the headwind).&#x0D; In cross-country skiers, the average values of body fat range between 4.8 and 12.7% in males and from 10.6 to 22.7% in females, while the average values of lean body mass (LBM) vary between 58.2 and 68.8 kg in males and from 45.6 to 48.6 kg in females. In alpine skiers, the mean values of body fat are between 9.7 and 15.8% in males and from 16.2 to 26.7% in females, and the LBM values in males range between 59.9 and 74.7 kg, in females from 42.1 to 52.8 kg. The span of body fat in male ski jumpers ranges from 8.6 to 16% with an LBM of 59.7 kg. Since 2012, a BMI of at least 21 kg/m² including suit and shoes has been a condition for ski jumpers to be able to use full-length skis (145% of body height). Otherwise, shorter skis have to be used, which reduces the wing area and is intended to reduce the jump distance as a penalty. The average values of body fat in male athletes of Nordic Combined range between 8.9 and 11.2%, and the corresponding LBM values are between 62.0 and 64.1 kg. When comparing these parameters of body composition, it must always be remembered that different methods of determining the body fat percentage have been used in corresponding studies and that possible differences do not represent a development of the skiing somatotypes over time but could also have methodological reasons.",

      "title": "Why I Smoke: Sociology of a Deadly Habit",
      "abstract": "Smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the United States. In the twenty first century everyone knows the harm that smoking can cause and yet people still willingly risk their lives for the habit. I am one of these people. I would not throw myself in front of a bus; I would not take Drano from my kitchen and choose to ingest it. One of human being's greatest instincts is survival. So why do I engage in this life threatening activity? The question cannot simply be answered in one way. There are physical, biological, social, and psychological reasons for the attraction of cigarettes. For our purposes I will use various sociological theories to understand why smoking has become such a huge force in my life and how society has played a role in this manifestation. Perhaps through researching why I smoke I will be able to see how I can stop. To people of my generation smoking carried along a million perceptions of what it symbolized. Smoking was cool and sexy. When we used to play house in third and fourth grade part of the game was to make fake cigarettes and pretend we were smokers. One of the most popular candies among my friends was candy or gum cigarettes that our parents would buy us. When my dad was a smoker I used to steal his packs and throw them away because I was taught in school how bad cigarettes were for you. As I got older and my parents became less and my peers more significant, it mattered more to me what kind of persona smoking illustrated than what I had been taught. I remember the first cigarette I ever smoked. I was in the seventh grade, twelve years old, behind a tree in my back yard with my best friend. She had smoked before, I hadn't. The girl I was with was a new friend. Until I met her I wasn't much of a rebel; I was more of a drama kid violin player who did what her mother said. This new friend was different from any I'd ever had. When she lit the cigarette and taught me how to inhale, I did not hesitate--as far as I can remember. It was too exciting; doing something I knew I shouldn't. It wasn't about smoking the cigarette, it was about what that symbolized in the life of junior high kids trying to find their place. I didn't start buying my own packs of cigarettes until the end of eighth grade. It became a pastime, a social event. We'd all go buy cigarettes after school and sit in the woods or at the park, or outside the mall and smoke them together. We'd practice how we smoked and look at ourselves in the mirror. When I was young the antismoking campaigns you see today weren't around. We knew it was bad for you but it was still cool. It said something about who you were and almost defined the kind of person or group you fit with. In ninth grade I began to be loyal to a certain brand of cigarettes, Parliament Lights. Despite what common research says I had never even seen these brands advertised before. I started smoking them because it was what all of my friends smoked not because Joe Camel told me to. Throughout my first two years of high school I was still a social smoker and could smoke and quit as many times as I wanted to. The fact of the matter is addiction sneaks up on you. Nicotine is an addictive substance. Obviously some of the reasoning for my becoming a full fledged smoker had to do with my body's dependence on the drug. At the same time cigarettes are addicting in other ways. I became socialized into and addicted to the smoking lifestyle. After all of my friends would sit down to eat, or when we were bored, upset, needed a break from work, or were drinking at a party, we would smoke a cigarette. It's a social thing. Sitting down with friends, smoking and talking is something that has occupied a great amount of time in my life. Smoking is even a way to make new friends. Asking for a lighter is a great pick up line at a bar. At Orientation before my first year of school I didn't know one single person. The boy sitting across from me at the lunch table said he was getting up to go smoke a cigarette. …",

This chapter indicates that young, low-income ecstasy users reported having more friends who used more licit and illicit drugs. It describes the characteristics of young, low-income female ecstasy users. These women perceived themselves using illicit drugs in the future, were at higher risk of continuing to use these drugs, and indicated higher levels of stress than respondents who used marijuana only or those who used other illicit drugs.",

      "title": "PELATIHAN BAHAYA NARKOBA DAN KENAKALAN REMAJA TERHADAP MANAJEMEN KEUANGAN",
      "abstract": "Menurut UU No. 22 Tahun 1997, Narkotika adalah “zat atau obat yang berasal dari tanaman atau bukan tanaman baik sintesis maupun semi sintesis yang dapat menyebabkan penurunan atau perubahan kesadaran, hilangnya rasa, mengurangi sampai menghilangkan rasa nyeri, dan dapat menimbulkan ketergantungan”. Sebenarnya Narkoba adalah obat legal yang digunakan dalam dunia kedokteran, namun dewasa ini Narkoba banyak disalahgunakan. Bahkan di kalangan remaja tidak sedikit yang terjerumus dalam bahaya narkoba. Banyak dari mereka yang menggunakan Narkoba dengan alasan untuk Upaya pemberantasan Narkoba pun sudah sering dilakukan, namun masih sedikit kemungkinan untuk menghindarkan Narkoba dari kalangan remaja maupun dewasa. Hingga saat ini upaya yang paling efektif untuk mencegah pengaruh Narkoba pada remaja yaitu dari pendidikan, keluarga. Orangtua diharapkan mengawasi dan mendidik anaknya untuk selalu menjauhi narkoba. Dan hingga kini narkoba pun telah merajalela di kalangan para remaja. Hal tersebut akan mengganggu prestasi belajar siswa yang mengkonsumsi Narkoba tersebut. Jika para remaja khususnya usia sekolah mengkonsumsi Narkoba tanpa henti (ketagihan) akan merusak beberapa jaringan di tubuh pecandu yang mengakibatkan tidak konsentrasi dalam pelajaran, selalu gelisah, tidak fokus pada pelajaran sehingga prestasi siswa pecandu akan menurun. Jika banyak remaja yang banyak mengkonsumsi narkoba dan banyak pula remaja yang sekolah akan kehilangan prestasi belajarnya. Kenakalan remaja adalah pelampiasan masalah yang dihadapi oleh kalangan remaja yang tindakannya menyimpang. Menurut ahli sosiologi Kartono, Kenakalan Remaja atau dalam bahasa Inggris dikenal dengan istilah juvenile delinquency merupakan gejala patologis sosial pada remaja yang disebabkan oleh satu bentuk pengabaian sosial. Akibatnya mereka mengembangkan bentuk perilaku yang menyimpang. Sedangkan menurut Santrock “Kenakalan remaja merupakan kumpulan dari berbagai perilaku remaja yang tidak dapat diterima secara sosial hingga terjadi tindakan kriminal.” Dengan adanya kenakalan remaja maka akan berpengaruh terhadap keuangan pribadi seseorang. Kesuksesan financial seseorang ditentukan oleh perilaku keuangan inividu itu sendiri. Tentunya banyak faktor yang mempengaruhi perilaku manajemen keuangan. Dalam teori perilaku terencana berasumsi bahwa perilaku seseorang dipengaruhi oleh sikap dan norma lain yang dipengaruhi oleh faktor eksternal, contohnya pengalaman, tingkat literasi dan pengetahuan seseorang. Perilaku manajemen keuangan adalah “kemampuan seseorang dalam mengatur (perencanaan, penganggaran, pemeriksaan, pengelolaan, pengendalian, pencarian dan penyimpanan) dana keuangan sehari-hari. Munculnya perilaku financial management, merupakan dampak dari besarnya hasrat seseorang untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidupnya sesuai dengan tingkat pendapatan yang diperoleh” (Al Kholilah &amp; Iramani, 2013). Dalam program kegiatan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat (PKM) kali ini sasarannya adalah para santriwan santriwati di yayasan Alkamilah dengan memberikan pengetahuan mengenai bahaya narkoba. Lembaga pendidikan diharapkan juga mampu mendidik mereka untuk menjadi generasi bebas narkoba dan kenakalan remaja khususnya para santri. Berdasarkan permasalahan yang dihadapi anggota Yayasan Alkamilah, Bojongsari, Depok, melalui kegiatan pengabdian kepada masyarakat (PKM) para dosen dan mahasiswa dari Universitas Pamulang mencoba membantu memberikan pelatihan-pelatihan yang dibutuhkan Yayasan Alkamilah untuk para anak didiknya. Diharapkan dengan pelatihan bahaya narkoba dan kenakalan remaja terhadap manajemen keuangan ini dapat membantu menambah ilmu pengetahuan, meningkatkan wawasan para santri di yayasan tersebut.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity in Saudi Arabia has highly elevated during the past decades. People in Saudi Arabia preferred the usage of remedies more than standard medicine. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the use of weight reduction herbal and home remedies in Tabuk, North West Saudi Arabia. Data about weight-loss herbal remedies were collected from major local herbalist shops. In addition, inherited weight-loss herbal and household remedies were collected. Data collected included composition, method of preparation, method of use, and any reported side effects. Some of these remedies were used either alone or in combination. Majority of these ingredients were boiled in water to be drunk or directly added to food. Most of these mixtures were taken before food to reduce appetite. Most of these herbs were recorded to produce side effects. Mainly people suffer from gastric symptoms and headache. Many natural herbal and home remedies are still in use in Tabuk for weight reduction. Many of these remedies lack important scientific evidence for their usage, effectiveness, or safety.",

Neben anderen positiven Eigenschaften wird die genußbringende und bewußtseinsverändernde Wirkung dieser Substanz geschätzt. Als Genußmittel ist der Alkohol aus unseren heutigen Lebensbezügen kaum wegzudenken. Ein mäßiger Alkoholkonsum wird gesellschaftlich akzeptiert und bis zu einem gewissen Grad gefordert. Im offiziellen und privaten Bereich gehört der Alkohol als fester, teilweise ritualisierter Bestandteil zu Begegnungen und Kommunikation. Erfolgt jedoch ein übermäßiger Konsum, also ein Mißbrauch, resultieren gesundheitsschädliche Auswirkungen. Ein langfristiger Mißbrauch kann nach einer Gewöhnungsphase in eine Alkoholabhängigkeit münden. Die Alkoholabhängigkeit ist eine schwere Suchterkrankung mit gravierenden Folgen. Die Kinder alkoholabhängiger Menschen kommen zwangsläufig frühzeitig mit den problematischen Auswirkungen der Alkoholsucht in Berührung. Für sie ergeben sich daraus weitreichende Konsequenzen.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide, tobacco use is considered the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. The most common form of tobacco use is cigarette smoking. Smoking increases a person’s risk for diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Associated with these increased risks for disease is a shortened lifespan in smokers. Research has also shown that cigarette smoking alters the body’s response to exercise. Nicotine and carbon monoxide are two compounds in cigarette smoke that may affect cardiorespiratory function, thereby modifying the body’s exercise response. Additionally, research has shown that compared to nonsmokers, smokers demonstrate a greater reliance on glucose as a fuel source during exercise. A focus of this review is on the cigarette smoke compounds nicotine and carbon monoxide and the mechanisms by which these compounds affect the human body. Also addressed are the physiological effects of cigarette smoking on exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity, and substrate utilization.",

      "title": "Drug adiction – it is just a medical problem?",
      "abstract": "Currently, drug addiction represents a phenomenon with serious medical repercussions related to the extremely important damages that it produces on our health. At the same time, the continually rising incidence and prevalence of drug consumption also make this phenomenon a serious public health problem. But, can we reduce drug addiction only to these aspects? Recent theories have made the assumption that the motivation for drug consumption can not be reduced only to the chemical properties of the drug, because there are comparative data that show that some people can become addict even from the first doses, even if they are little, whereas in the case of others the addictive behavior does not appear even in case of big doses of drug; the explanation could rely on the deep roots of this phenomenon which confers it profound social repercussions, such as social insatisfaction, socio-familial background, etc. These elements, next to the perception of society, which stigmatizes the supporters of drug consumption, marginalizes them or just disposes of them, without the possibility of any subsequent reinsertion, transform this phenomenon into a real social problem. Although drug consumption produces major damages on the physical and mental health, the voluntary demand level for specialized anti-drug treatment is extremely low compared to the number of addicts and the explanation can probably be related to this social perception which brings along the addicts’ lack of confidence in values such as confidentiality of medical information. And what if the medical personnel also have a discriminating and stigmatizing attitude in relation to this category? To what extent do drugaddicts have the same rights as the other patients and to what extent are they respected? To what extent the drug addict position itself represents a reason for discrimination in relation to the other patients? These are aspects that make drug addiction an important ethical problem.",

      "abstract": "Although tobacco use by both men and women has been documented throughout history,', , two technological developments in the 19th century radically and irreversibly changed societal patterns of nicotine use. First, the introduction of flue-curing yielded a product with a lower pH and milder smoke that could be readily inhaled through the lungs, producing a rapid rise of nicotine in plasma that appears to contribute to the reinforcing and addictive properties of nicotine by partially overcoming tolerance, and delivering nicotine via a process that maximizes exposure to carcinogens. Second, the invention by a Virginian named James Bonsack of a cigaret-rolling machine, which could turn out as many cigarets as could 40 workers rolling manually, made that product widely and cheaply available. With these innovations, tobacco use was fairly quickly transformed from a somewhat distasteful and unhealthful habit, alternately lauded and reviled, to what is arguably the most critical public health problem we face today.

In such settings, focus is often placed on the type of insulin the patient is taking, with an even greater emphasis placed on the amount. However, how much emphasis is placed on the practical aspects of insulin use? Is the patient using proper injection techniques? Are the insulin syringes or pens being cared for correctly? Are needles being quietly re-used without the medical staff’s knowledge? Are sharps being disposed of safely? Diabetes education regarding the proper use of insulin takes much time and effort. Without it, however, the appropriate type of insulin at the correct dose might not necessarily give the intended outcome. Instead, marked glycemic excursions could occur, leaving the goal of good diabetes control unachievable and the medical staff baffled.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Amateur foraging, which can be described as the gathering of uncultivated plants for sustenance or recreation, supports many benefits for the forager and the environment; however, it can also present the hazard of unintentional poisoning. Asclepias syriaca, or common milkweed, is a potentially edible plant that also contains cardioactive steroids akin to digoxin. A 38-year-old female amateur forager boiled and sautéed 8-10 milkweed pods before ingesting them. She developed vomiting and heart palpitations within 1 hour and presented to an emergency department 3 hours after ingestion. Her exam was within normal limits with exception of heart rate in the 40-50s without hypotension. ECG was notable for sinus bradycardia. Laboratory analysis was notable for a detectable serum digoxin concentration. Life-threatening toxicity did not occur. Recently, some military services have advocated for foraging as a means to sustain far-forward troops. However, misidentification of plants by inexperienced foragers can result in severe toxicity or death. If mass foraging becomes part of expeditionary operations, military clinicians must be trained and prepared for the potentially severe plant-related poisonings.",

Spadamo med tako imenovane »mokre« kulture, saj je tolerantnost do alkohola v Sloveniji kar velika, ker je uživanje le-tega prisotno v vsakdanjem življenju. Mladostniki pravijo, da s pridobivanjem alkoholnih pijac nimajo težav in da uživajo v pitju zaradi okusa in ucinkov, ki jih ima alkohol. Mladostnike zunanji vplivi prepricujejo, da brez alkohola ni vec zabave, zato se vse vec mladostnikov zateka k pitju, vendar pa se ne zavedajo njegovih skodljivih posledic. Alkohol ima na cloveka tako telesne kot tudi psiholoske in socialne vplive, privede lahko do invalidnosti in povzroci tudi smrt. Uživanje alkohola v dobi mladostnika, predvsem pitje do pijanosti, je zaskrbljujoce, saj ima tako kratkorocne kot dolgorocne posledice. Namen: Namen diplomskega dela je ugotoviti problematiko tveganega pitja alkohola in alkoholnih zastrupitev pri mladostnikih. Metode dela: Uporabljena je bila deskriptivna metoda dela, ki je vkljucevala pregled domace in tuje literature. Pregledani so bili strokovni in znanstveni clanki v angleskem in slovenskem jeziku, pisna gradiva ter aktualne spletne strani. Razprava in zakljucek: Za zmanjsanje posledic, ki nastanejo kot posledica opijanja oziroma pitja alkohola, je potrebno dobro zacrtati alkoholno politiko in vztrajno delati na preventivi, potrebno je ustvariti odgovornejsi odnos do alkohola v družbi in v solsko okolje uvesti preventivne programe, katerih namen je preprecevanje skodljivega pitja. Pomembno vlogo imajo tudi medicinske sestre, ki z mladostniki preživijo najvec casa, zato je pomembno, da se dodatno izobražujejo iz specialnih znanj, saj le tako delujejo ucinkovito in uspesno zdravstveno vzgojno. Zdravstveno vzgojno pa lahko na otroke in mladostnike delujejo v vrtcih, solah, v skupnosti ter v okviru preventivnih in sistematicnih pregledov.",

They almost always act locally and have\r\nfew systemic effects. Caustic poisonings can occur after ingestion of\r\ncaustic substances, such as acids and alkalis.\r\nThe most commonly abused substance among acids is hydrochloric\r\nacid. Alkali ingestion is more common in the western developed\r\ncountries. In India, acid ingestion is the cause of corrosive oesophageal\r\nstrictures in about 75% of patients. Accidental ingestion of acids and\r\nalkalis has been reported to be less common in western countries at\r\npresent as the effective publicity and the enforcement of the law to ban\r\nthe sale of strong acids and alkalis in the open market. Accidental\r\ningestion is more common in children and drunken adults, due to careless\r\nstoring of chemicals .Ingestion with suicidal intent is more common in\r\nIndia due to free availability of the caustic agents mostly used for toilet\r\ncleaning purposes.\r\nPost-corrosive injuries with different degrees of severity can occur\r\nalong the entire oesophagus particularly in the middle and distal part,\r\nmore precisely at the site of physiological narrowing. In the stomach,\r\nthey can appear in the antrum and pylorus. Strictures isolated to the\r\nstomach due to acid or alkali is not an uncommon entity in our tertiary\r\ncentre where lot of patients particularly corrosive injuries are referred.\r\nAIM :\r\nTo find out the mean duration between corrosive consumption and\r\ndevelopment of the gastric stricture.\r\nTo find out the common site of stricture in the stomach\r\nWhether isolated or combined with esophageal stricture.\r\nType of surgical procedure in relation to site of stricture and\r\noutcome after the procedure and to formulate a new working\r\nclassification which will help in deciding the type of surgery in patients\r\nwith corrosive gastric stricture.\r\nCONCLUSION :\r\nOur study on corrosive gastric stricture have certain implications to\r\nsuggest :\r\nCorrosive stricture can be isolated to stomach or associated with\r\noesophageal stricture.\r\nThe morbidity and mortality of gastric corrosive stricture can be\r\nsignificantly reduced by adequate preoperative nutritional optimisation\r\nand pre operative evaluation to asses the extent of injury.\r\nThis new working Classification will help in deciding the surgical\r\nstrategy to be adopted in the management of corrosive gastric stricture\r\naccording to the site of the stricture.\r\nThe long-term results, particularly in the relief of symptoms, weight\r\ngain and quality of life are better after surgical management of corrosive\r\ngastric stricture.",

Drug use is a firm and accepted part of our culture; indeed, we are a drug-oriented society. People of all ages utilize a variety of prescription and non-prescription chemicals to alter symptoms, feelings, moods, or mind-states. Drug abuse applies to taking drugs in a manner that is organically or psychologically destructive, either because of the nature of the drug used or the quantity consumed. The term \"abuse\" unfortunately has been used pejoratively at times to criticize any drug use that is threatening, for real or imagined reasons, to the dominant society and its mores. Drug abuse is not a phenomenon restricted to contemporary youth; the significant point of distinction between the generations is that each has its \"own\" favourites. Alcohol, nicotine, tranquillizers, sedatives, stimulants, and pain relievers—traditional drugs—are as susceptible to use and to abuse as are the drugs more commonly favoured by the younger generation.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the topic of the presented study lies in the fact that the problem of a healthy lifestyle in the modern world is quite popular. In terms of this problem, the penitentiary system is no exception, since in order to achieve the most effective results of the performance of employees, the lifestyle they lead plays an important role. The surveys showed that the vast majority of employees of the above system do not adhere to proper nutrition, do not engage in physical training, which is especially important from a certain age, and 80% of them are smokers. The author concludes that the physical training of penitentiary staff is directly influenced by such factors as nutrition, smoking and maintaining physical fitness at a high level. A system of measures is needed that includes such rules for a balanced diet, strengthening physical condition through regular physical activity, and they should consist of both general developmental workouts that involve the largest number of muscles, and certain types of training aimed at increasing the level of self-defense, for example, study and improvement of combat techniques of struggle; giving up bad habits such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. If a set of events with specialists invited to work on healthy lifestyles in each specific institution will work like clockwork, then the level of physical fitness of employees will remain at a high level, which is extremely important when working with convicts.",

Facilitar el acceso a equipos de inyeccion higienicos, a traves de los denominados programas de intercambio de jeringuillas, es un buen ejemplo de estas practicas que han reportado beneficios incuestionables aunque todavia insuficientes. Es posible desarrollar, de forma complementaria, otras intervenciones preventivas que tienen como objetivo contribuir a la introduccion de cambios en las tecnicas de inyeccion, para disminuir muchos de los riesgos, como infecciones o sobredosis, derivados de las practicas incorrectas durante el consumo de las distintas drogas. Cuando el objetivo de la prevencion no es la poblacion de potenciales consumidores, sino los usuarios de drogas en activo, puede ser interesante contar con la colaboracion de los propios drogodependientes, tratando de convertirlos en agentes educativos que puedan participar en acciones dirigidas a adiestrar o entrenar en un consumo mas seguro de las distintas drogas a sus pares. Los Talleres de Consumo de Menor Riesgo pueden constituir el modelo idoneo de referencia para intentar actuar en la divulgacion y adiestramiento de tecnicas de consumo mas seguras y conductas para la prevencion de sobredosis. Para reducir los riesgos asociados al consumo, otras estrategias, como facilitar kits de naloxona, a determinados consumidores, pueden ser acciones a tener tambien en cuenta en la medida que su eficacia se vaya demostrando.",

      "abstract": "Many indispensable drugs are known to be dangerous when used in improper dose or by unusual routes of administration—digitalis, iodine and others immediately come to mind as illustrations. Certain toxic drugs— arsenicals, for example—continue in use because of their effectiveness and because nontoxic substitutes of proved effectiveness are lacking. It cannot sensibly be argued that an effective drug should be dropped from use simply because the occasional patient reacts unfavorably to the ordinary dose or because untoward reactions follow the accidental administration of an excessive dose. When, however, a drug can be shown to be almost entirely ineffective and at the same time dangerous even when used in ordinary ways, it is time to remove that drug from general use as rapidly as possible. Boric acid is such a drug. Search of medical literature reveals many instances of accidental poisoning with boric acid and not a few following its calculated",

      "abstract": "Tobacco addiction is one of the oldest known addictions with annual death toll of three million. And India is the second largest consumer of tobacco in the world because of easy availability of variety of smoking and smokeless tobacco products in the market. This has made the situating very complex in India, as the same tobacco generating billions of revenues for India is also a financial burden over the health care sector. Tobacco is a risk factor for approximately 50 serious health care diseases including infertility. But it is surprising that only 22% of the general population are familiar with the reproductive risks associated with smoking. This shear ignorance has led to increase in smoking among women too. Tobacco use not only decrease fecundity and reproductive potential of the individual, but also causes relationship disharmony among the already emotional wrecked infertile couple. Though this stress might be the contributory factor towards tobacco abuse but ironically this tobacco use further escalates the financial ‘stress’ in these couples. Multiple attempts may be required during the process of quitting and the likelihood of success increases with each attempt. The ultimate key is counselling, education, and encouragement at each clinical visit.",

The energy intake of a developing athlete should be determined individually based on gender, anthropometric measurement, character, and number of workouts per day. The frequent presence of drowsiness and fatigue during training may indicate insufficient dietary energy supply. Dehydration exceeding 2% of body weight should be prevented. Isotonic drinks should only be consumed during training longer than 75 minutes. Young swimmers should consume adequate amounts of carbohydrates to restore glycogen reserves before another training unit. Carbohydrates with a high glycemic index of 1-1.2 g/kg b.w./h should be delivered during the post-training period. Immediately following training, a meal containing a complete protein should be consumed to accelerate post-exercise recovery. The total protein supply should be at least 1.2 g/kg b.w./h. The minimum intake of fat in the diet of a young swimmer should be 2 g/kg lean b.w. It is recommended to limit products containing large amounts of saturated fatty acids.",

Recientemente se han introducido los sistemas electronicos de administracion de nicotina, comunmente conocidos como cigarrillos electronicos. Este trabajo tiene como objetivos describir y exponer la composicion de los cigarrillos electronicos, efecto sobre la salud y necesidad del conocimiento de este dispositivo en la practica medica comunitaria. Desarrollo El cigarrillo electronico es un dispositivo con forma de cigarrillo convencional, consta de boquilla, bateria, camara de vaporizacion, el cartucho de la solucion, que es el que contiene el liquido que se convierte en aerosol, formando particulas finas y ultrafinas en fase gaseosa. Libera determinadas dosis de vapores de nicotina y otras sustancias a traves de un proceso de calentamiento electronico. Los cartuchos tienen mucha variabilidad en la cantidad de nicotina liberada, contiene otras sustancias como el propilenglicol, glicerina vegetal, propanodion, altas concentraciones de particulas PM 2.5, carcinogenos como los hidrocarburos aromaticos y aluminio, entre otros productos irritantes de las vias respiratorias. Conclusiones Actualmente se debate en cuanto a la seguridad y efectos sobre la salud, tanto del usuario como de los que estan expuestos a ese vapor. Su potencial de adiccion, puede constituir la antesala para pasar al uso del cigarrillo convencional. Puede tener un efecto indeseable al estimular el consumo en adolescentes o retener a fumadores adultos en el consumo de nicotina y reforzar la dependencia.",

Research shows that nicotine is a sine qua non of tobacco addiction and that it produces the hallmark effects of addictive drugs: sensitization, tolerance, physical dependence, and euphoria/elation. Research on the development of smoking reveals that although smoking prevalence has declined from a peak in the mid-1990s, close to 30% of twelfth graders still smoke. Smoking in adolescents is related to development of physical dependence, ethnicity, impulsivity, affective disorder, and peer influences. However, which of these exerts the greatest causal effects is unknown, and their influence no doubt varies across individuals and across development. Once dependence on tobacco smoking is established, evidence suggests that tobacco motivation is strongly influenced by a reduction in withdrawal symptoms, an expectation of stress reduction, and conditioned reinforcement. Nicotine motivation may also be influenced by modulation in stimulus incentive value.",

Precedenti ricerche hanno mostrato che i tipi serotini sono quelli che tendono ad utilizzare con piu frequenza sostanze psicoattive. Allo scopo di replicare tali evidenze in un campione di individui italiani, e di valutare se l’utilizzo di tali sostanze risulti differenziato nei diversi cronotipi in funzione del proprio livello circadiano di attivazione, ad un campione di 205 studenti universitari e stato somministrato un questionario sugli stili di vita. I risultati confermano che i soggetti serotini tendono ad utilizzare con piu frequenza alcune sostanze psicoattive, in particolare nicotina e alcool. L’ipotesi secondo la quale l’assunzione di sostanze psicoattive avviene in modo differenziato nelle due tipologie in relazione all’effetto, di attivazione o relax, che si vuole ottenere nei diversi momenti della giornata non sembra essere confermata dai dati di questa ricerca. Emerge comunque chiaramente che gli studenti serotini tendono piu dei loro colleghi mattutini a fare un maggiore uso di sostanze psicoattive, esponendosi con piu frequenza a comportamenti a rischio, potenzialmente dannosi per il loro benessere. Questo ultimo risultato viene discusso in relazione a dati recenti della letteratura scientifica, secondo i quali la tipologia serotina sembra essere un fattore di rischio in relazione al consumo di sostanze psicoattive.",

The prevalence of smokers is high among alcohol dependent individuals and people who overconsume alcohol get more nicotine withdrawal symptoms when trying to quit tobacco and are less likely to succeed. Alcohol as well as smoking provides a high burden of disease, and combined use often causes multiplier damage effects. Alcohol dependent persons die more often from smoking-related illness than from alcohol. Nicotine cessation is more successful if alcohol advice is included. Cross-tolerance and other interactions between nicotine and opioids increase the likelihood of dependence. Tobacco smokers need higher opioid doses against pain. Despite evidence of association between smoking and chronic pain, understanding of causality is limited. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of opioid dependence. Nicotine is recognized as an important underlying factor. Further research in humans concerning the interactions between nicotine and opioids is urgent. Treatment of nicotine dependence in the medical management of opioid dependence seems promising, but at what point in the course - simultaneously, shortly after, or far behind - has yet to be determined.",

This may involve long-term maintenance to reduce use of illicit drugs, and/or short-term detoxification to stop such use completely. Standard management involves methadone maintenance therapy.3 Buprenorphine (Subutex – Schering-Plough) is also licensed for the management of patients with opioid dependence.4 Here we review the evidence for the use of buprenorphine compared with methadone for opioid dependence.",

The manner that dietary acids are introduced into the mouth (gulping, sipping, use of a straw) will affect how long the teeth are in contact with the erosive challenge. The frequency and duration of exposure to an erosive agent is of paramount importance. Night-time exposure (e.g. baby bottle-feeding) to erosive agents may be particularly destructive because of the absence of salivary flow. Health-conscious individuals tend to ingest acidic drinks and juices more frequently and tend to have higher than average oral hygiene. While good oral hygiene is of proven value in the prevention of periodontal disease and dental caries, frequent toothbrushing with abrasive oral hygiene products may enhance erosive tooth wear. Unhealthy lifestyles such as consumption of designer drugs, alcopops and alcohol abuse are other important behavioral factors.",

It is administered, perhaps, as an antidote to stress or to cope with trauma. But what begins as a means to succor from physical and psychological suffering imperceptibly but inevitably becomes an end in itself. Without recognizing it, one grows dependent on the drug. It gradually begins to distort one's sense of reality and leads to saying and doing things one would not have done in a nonaddicted state. Often, it leads to a kind of languor and to neglect of important tasks. The alcoholic's once bright potential slips away in a haze of paranoia, hostility, irresponsibility, and self -disrespect. But, significantly, the alcoholic will not, cannot, admit to the addiction. The alcoholic invents all sorts of reasons why he or she cannot live without drink. The alcoholic is consumed by fear of life without a support line. And try as he might to avoid it, there is an inescapable and terrible fact that the alcoholic must ultimately face: There is only one sure cure for alcoholism-abstinence . Like alcohol to alcoholics, tenure is too important to the American professoriat. Among a sample of humanities professors, tenure was ranked as the most significant factor to be considered when seeking a job, and a cross-section of the general professorial population ranked it a close second to money. Moreover, where tenure was once a means to the noble end of unfettered pursuit of knowledge, it has now become an end in itself.

Fortunately, human beings have, in principle, control over their conduct. Health-compromising behaviors can be eliminated by self-regulatory efforts, and health-enhancing behaviors. For instance, physical exercise, weight control, preventive nutrition, dental hygiene, or condom use, can be adopted. Perceiving a health threat seems to be the most obvious prerequisite for the motivation to end a risky behavior. In summary, changing health-related behaviors involves an initial motivation process that results in setting goals and a subsequent self-regulation processes that address the pursuit of these goals. Health psychologists are attempting to model these processes in order to understand how people become motivated to change their risky behaviors, and how they become encouraged to adopt and maintain healthy actions. In the initial motivation phase, a person develops an intention to act.",

The author of this paper has suffered from the effects of insomnia. He has performed some experimentation on himself with a number of publicly available supplements including Melatonin with a view to ameliorating the insomnia with some success. He will be writing papers which report his conclusions. This is the first. Methods: Over a period of 3 years the author has tried a range of different strategies for reducing the effects of insomnia with supplements including Melatonin and measured the effects on his sleep using a sleep monitor and otherwise. Results: It is clear for the test subject that relatively substantial doses of Melatonin (15-110mg) taken during the night can assist with the failure of sleep maintenance and thereby improve the ability of the subject to function intellectually during the day rather than suffer from afternoon fatigue. There may be other people that this approach could benefit. Caution and further research is, however, needed as there may be side effects. An alternative strategy is to clear down the melatonin system and restart it.",

It has both positive and negative effects on the human body, and its activity concerns a variety of systems including the central nervous system, immune system, digestive system, respiratory system, urinary tract, etc. These effects are dependent on quantity, the type of product in which caffeine is contained, and also on the individual differences among people (sex, age, diet etc.). The main aim of this review was to collect, present, and analyze the available information including the latest discoveries on the impact of caffeine on human health and the functioning of human body systems, taking into account the role of caffeine in individual disease entities. We present both the positive and negative sides of caffeine consumption and the healing properties of this purine alkaloid in diseases such as asthma, Parkinson's disease, and others, not forgetting about the negative effects of excess caffeine (e.g., in people with hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly). In summary, we can conclude, however, that caffeine has a multi-directional influence on various organs of the human body, and because of its anti-oxidative properties, it was, and still is, an interesting topic for research studies including those aimed at developing new therapeutic strategies.",

One was fictional and one was attempted, but they show how even 200 to 300 years ago people overdosed on opioids (or what they thought were opioids) when they found themselves in unbearable situations.",

Increasing use of youth sports participants, as well as collegiate and professionals, means sports medicine providers and coaches alike should be familiar with the effects of these devices. Current evidence demonstrates an impact on both the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. These effects appear less significant than smoking tobacco cigarettes, but the extent and longevity of the consequences of ENDS use is unclear. Mechanisms for recovery, such as sleep and injury healing, also are affected. Lastly, the emergence of life-threatening pulmonary disease associated with ENDS use may have devastating effects on an athlete. This article will highlight the recent literature on the impact of ENDS on athletes and athletic performance, as well as the potentially life-threatening consequences of use.",

      "title": "FAKTOR PENYEBAB TERJADINYA TINDAK PIDANA PENYALAHGUNAAN NARKOTIKA OLEH ANGGOTA POLRI WILAYAH HUKUM POLRESTA PADANG",
      "abstract": "Dalam awal perkembangannya, narkotika, psikotoprika, dan zat adiktif lainnya (NARKOBA) dikenal dan\r\ndipergunakan manusia untuk mengatasi berbagai masalah terutama untuk kepentingan kesehatan dan sosial. Hanya saja\r\nselain dari pengaruh positifnya, bahan-bahan ini juga banyak mengandung pengaruh negatif yang sangat membahayakan\r\nbagi kelangsungan hidup manusia. Pada masa ini narkotika tidak saja dipergunakan sebagai bahan-bahan untuk\r\nmenunjang kesehatan namun dipergunakan untuk tujuan lain yaitu untuk menimbulkan rasa senang, tenang, tenteram,\r\nberani, kuat juga hebat bagi penggunanya. Polisi selaku penyidik supaya melakukan tindakan tegas kepada para\r\npenyelundup, pembuat narkoba, pengedar untuk menerapkan ancaman hukuman tertinggi dalam Undang-Undang\r\nNarkoba. Akan tetapi dengan tugas dan tanggung jawab yang seperti itu, justru Polri sebagai penegak hukum juga ikut\r\nserta mengkonsumsi narkotika tersebut. Hal ini dapat dibuktikan berdasarkan data tahunan penyalahgunaan narkotika\r\noleh Polri di Polresta Kota Padang, membuktikan tingkat penyalahgunaan narkotika yang dilakukan oleh anggota Polri\r\nselalu ada tiap tahunnya. Hal ini patut dipertanyakan, mengapa anggota Polri tersebut bisa ikut serta dalam\r\npenyalahgunaan narkotika sedangkan dia merupakan aparat penegak hukum. Polri yang melakukan penyalahgunaan\r\nnarkotika tersebut khususnya pemakai juga dijerat dalam UU. No 35 Tahun 2009 tentang narkotika dalam Pasal 111 dan\r\n112, dan Polri tersebut juga akan mendapatkan sanksi profesi yang terdapat dalam Peraturan Kepala Kepolisian Negara\r\nRepublik Indonesia NO. POL. : 7 Tahun 2006. Penelitian dilakukan di Polresta Kota Padang yang bertujuan untuk: a)\r\nmengetahui apakah faktor yang melandasi terjadinya penyalahgunaan narkotika oleh anggota Polri, b) mengetahui\r\nbagaimana upaya penanggulangan dari tindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika yang dilakukan oleh anggota Polri, c)\r\nmengetahui kendala-kendala yang dihadapi dalam menanggulangi terjadinya tindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika\r\noleh anggota Polri. Dalam penelitian ini digunakan metode yuridis sosiologis dengan spesifikasi pembahasannya yaitu\r\ndeskriptif, teknik pengumpulan datanya studi dokumen dan penelitian lapangan melalui wawancara, kemudian dianalisis\r\nsecara kualitatif. Dari hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan bahwa faktor penyebab terjadinya tindak pidana\r\npenyalahgunaan narktika oleh anggota Polri adalah: a) faktor individu, faktor ini terdapat dalam pribadi anggota Polri\r\nsendiri yang meliputi emosi dan rasa penasaran terhadap narkotika, b) faktor lingkungan, terdapat dalam lingkungan\r\nPolri yang sering berhadapan dengan narkotika sehingga anggota Polri sulit untuk menghindari keinginan untuk\r\nmencoba barang haram tersebut. Upaya penanggulangan penyalahgunaan narkotika oleh Polri dilakukan dengan: upaya\r\npreentif yaitu berupa himbauan/ teguran saja dan dalam upaya ini terdapat penerapan 2 program, upaya preventif\r\ndilakukan dengan penerapan 3 program, upaya represif yakni penindakan secara hukum semua jenis tindak pidana\r\npenyalahgunaan narkotika oleh anggota Polri. Kendala yang dihadapi polisi dalam penerapan program penanggulangan\r\ntindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika oleh anggota Polri terbagi dalam kendala internal dan kebndala eksternal.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a many-headed Hydra, which grows new smokers' heads as fast as they are lopped off. Efforts to change smokers' behavior usually reach a point of diminishing returns, as evidenced by experiences in smoking withdrawal clinics and in public anti-smoking education campaigns. Obviously, many smokers are refactory to anti-smoking education, a situation which has generated a great deal of pharmacological, neurochemical, psychological, and sociological research. The National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health in the U.S.A. has used a \"gradualist\" or permissive approach in anti-smoking messages, aimed at less hazardous smoking \"if you must smoke,\" rather than at complete cessation, and found this approach to be useful. U.S.A. school-children are exposed to anti-smoking education in lower grades than formerly, when it was offered in high school. Thus a population of as yet non-smoking children is being educated. Perhaps the adult non-smokers should be enlisted in an effort to create a social climate wherein smoking is not an acceptable behavior-an approach reflecting the concept of smoking as a social disease. Health education addressed to the receptive non-smoker would circumvent the refractory smoker. A theme with appeal to non-smokers is the protest against environmental pollution by smokers. It is possible that if a movement by non-smokers against smoking would gather momentum, it could turn the present accepting social climate into one rejecting smoking, thus striking at the regeneration of the Hydra: the incessant recruitment of smokers among ex-smokers and non-smokers. With recruitment below replacement level, the Hydra would in time wither away.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs has become a concern in high-performance athletes. Professional athletes are more exposed to drugs than the general population. Although some drugs are unquestionably detrimental to performance, several studies have nevertheless shown evidence of increased consumption of these substances within this sub-population. This review aimed to elucidate alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, cannabis, and opioid use among high-performance athletes, discussing the prevalence of substance use, its impacts, and alternatives to treatment in this special population. Unfortunately, no clinical trials for the treatment of substance use disorders were carried out with this specific sub-population. Therefore, the strategies adopted for the general population should be adapted to high-performance athletes. Psychological, psychosocial, psychoeducational, cognitive-behavioural, motivational interviewing approaches can be implemented. As regards pharmacological treatment, medications used in the treatment of alcohol and tobacco dependence, such as naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate, varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement treatment can be used without problems. However, some medications used in cocaine and opioid dependence treatment, such as moldafinil and methadone, are prohibited by doping enforcement agencies. Professionals involved with athletes should be aware of the signs and symptoms of the acute effects of substances so as to enable an early identification of substance abuse problems, especially during training periods.",

      "abstract": "Various fitness drinks under the designation of \"energy or power drinks\" or \"brain or athletic food\" are very popular among young people. For those entrusted with rendering expert opinions that poses the question of whether consumption of these beverages is of any importance when a person's ability to drive or mental capacity has to be assessed, especially in combination with alcoholic beverages imbibed at the same time. In the case discussed here-both the 20-year-old car driver and his passenger suffered not inconsiderable injuries-an alcohol concentration of 1.2 per mille was found at the time a blood sample was taken. Furthermore, a caffeine content of 1.5 micrograms/ml was noted. A value also reached after drinking a cup of filter coffee. In contrast, values of 2 to 10 micrograms/ml are reached when caffeine is used for therapeutic purposes. Values of more than 15 micrograms/ml are considered toxic. The measured caffeine content was thus fully insignificant. The same also applies to the \"active ingredients\" (taurine, glucuronolactone) contained in the beverage \"Red Bull\". Another assumption that, namely, the effect of alcohol can be offset by such beverages could lead to a situation in which young people incorrectly assess their ability to drive after imbibing alcohol and fitness drinks. That is naturally given support by corresponding tributes by the manufacturers (\"improves performance\", \"invigorates the mind and body\").",

But return the addict to his former associates and haunts, and although he fully realizes how his addiction has ruined his career, he will not hesitate to take up the vice again. Drug addicts are very generous with their drug to their fellow sufferers. They will always share the potion with another, no matter what his appearance or station in life may be.

If a college student takes a drug that has been prescribed for one of his friends, this is drug misuse, but if a problem develops from his self-use of a mind-altering chemical substance, this is drug abuse. Drug dependence is another term for chronic drug abuse. Part of the importance of these distinctions lies in pointing out to physicians how they may inadvertently contribute to the drug problem in this country.",

      "title": "Smoking kills (alcoholics)! shouldn't we do something about it?",
      "abstract": "In general, 'drinkers smoke', and a high proportion of the alcohol-dependent population is also nicotine-dependent. Statistically, the majority of alcoholics will die of smoking-related, rather than alcohol-related, disease. This co-dependent sub-population may have higher levels of nicotine dependence, and find smoking cessation more difficult. Major reasons are that concurrent alcohol use, and/or prior alcohol exposure, may change the reinforcing effects of nicotine, and that each drug becomes a pharmacological cue for the expectation of the other. If so, then smokers whose nicotine dependence is impacted by alcohol, represent a large and distinct sub-population in which both the therapeutic and molecular targets for smoking cessation are altered. This, in turn, has implications for the validity of animal models of nicotine reinforcement, and for the development of novel smoking cessation medications. It is no longer possible to ignore the fact that the two most prevalent and damaging addictive drugs in our society are very commonly used by the same individuals. Without a better understanding of the psychological and pharmacological interactions between alcohol and nicotine that impact dependence, we cannot hope to provide appropriate medications for this large and problematic patient group. Our intention in this opinion overview is to use the current literature to provide a framework for future studies into the impact of alcohol use on the reinforcing effects of nicotine.",

      "title": "Alcohol Actions on Glutamate Receptors",
      "abstract": "Alcohol is arguably the oldest drug known to man, its use dating back at least 10,000 yr to the dawn of human civilization (1). Although illicit drug use often receives more attention in contemporary society, alcohol abuse exacts a devastating toll: In the United States at present, over 7% of the population meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or alcoholism (2), over 28% of children under 18 yr of age are exposed to alcohol abuse or dependence in the home (3), and the overall economic cost to society of alcohol abuse has been estimated at $ 185 billion (4). Despite intensive research since the latter part of the previous century, it is clear that the biological actions that are responsible for the characteristic effects of ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, on human physiology and behavior are still incompletely understood. Because of the simple chemical structure of ethanol (it differs from water only by two methylene groups) and its low potency (it produces most of its biological effects at millimolar concentrations), alcohol undoubtedly interacts with multiple sites in the central nervous system. The biological effects of alcohol almost certainly reflect its concerted actions at a number of these sites. Of the many possible targets of alcohol actions, neurotransmitter receptors, and in particular, neurotransmitter-gated receptor-ion channels are currently believed to be among the most important (5). Because the neurotransmitter glutamate mediates the majority of fast excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system via actions on glutamate-gated receptor-ion channels (6), effects of alcohol on these ion channels could profoundly alter central nervous system function.",

      "abstract": "One factor that may encourage smoking despite its known adverse health consequences is its association with weight control. Middle-aged and older smokers weigh less than comparably aged non-smokers but smoking has minimal impact on body weight in young smokers. Smoking cessation produces weight gain in both men and women, although the magnitude of this gain and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Physical activity does not appear to be a factor. The effect of smoking cessation on energy intake is complicated, with few studies looking at changes after long periods, but there do seem to be sustained increases in energy intake in women. Removal of the acute increases in metabolic rate caused by smoking may contribute to post-cessation weight gain but there are no reliable long-term changes in metabolic rate after cessation. Behavioural and pharmacologic interventions to prevent weight gain after cessation are described.",

At the highest levels of competitive sports, where athletes strain to improve performances already at the limits of human ability, the temptation to use a drug that might provide an edge can be powerful. Many athletes persist in using performance-enhancing drugs despite official disapproval, possible disqualification, and even risk to their own health. They do so in the face of expert opinion, which casts doubt on the effectiveness of the drugs they take. Reasons commonly given to limit liberty fall into three classes: those that claim that the practice interferes with capacities for rational choice; those that emphasize harms to self; and those that emphasize harms to others. The case of performance-enhancing drugs and sport illustrates a fourth reason that may justify some interference with liberty, a phenomenon we can call \"inherent coerciveness.\"",

The popularity of e-cigarette has increased rapidly in recent years. The increase in its use during the adolescence period is attention-grabbing. Despite the fact that e-cigarette has become popular in a dramatic way, there are certain differences of opinion regarding its long-term effects on health, in particular. While some people assert that it is less harmful than conventional cigarettes, some others assert the contrary. Although e-cigarette contains less toxic substances compared to conventional cigarette, it contains certain carcinogens existing in conventional cigarette such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. It also contains heavy metals (nickel, chrome) that conventional cigarette does not contain; and therefore, raises concerns about health. E-cigarette leads to upper and lower respiratory tract irritation as well as an increased airway resistance and an increased bacterial colonization in the respiratory tract. It may also cause tahcycardia and increase diastolic blood pressure. Although e-cigarette has been found to have certain benefits in terms of smoking cessation, most of the studies have shown unfavorable results. In this collected work, the effects of e-cigarette on health and its role in smoking cessation are discussed in detail.",

Today, this concept, which was successful with illegal drugs, cannot be applied to tobacco because of a lack of proof. There is no safe cigarette and all brands have the same toxicity. Arguments in favor of smokeless tobacco are still insufficient for a public health decision. A voluntary decrease of tobacco consumption does not decrease morbidity and mortality of heavy smokers. A long-term use of nicotine replacement therapy is acceptable to reduce the daily smoking under medical supervision in smokers with chronic tobacco related disease who have previously failed in attempts to quit smoking.",

[1] Although the causes of this trend are multifaceted, there is growing evidence that food commercials are a major contributor. [2] Food consumption can be activated by salient environmental cues in an automatic and difficult to control way. [3] Content analyses reveal that the majority of food products promoted are energy-dense and high in fat, sugar, and/ or salt, which is in sharp contrast to (inter)national dietary guidelines. [2]Cue reactivity theory states that food cues induce craving for food and actual eating behavior owing to the presence of sensory inputs associated with past consumption. [4,5] The sight, smell, or thought of tasty food induces appetite, and insuffcient inhibitory control causes failure in inhibition, leading to increased food intake. [6,7] Impaired behavioral inhibition (ie, impulsivity) might make it more diffi cult for children to resist the temptation of energy-dense food. [8,9] Impulsivity is generally defi ned as the tendency to control, think, and plan insuffi ciently. [10] Two aspects ofimpulsivity can be distinguished: insuffi cient inhibitory behavioral control and reward sensitivity or the inability to delay reward.

The origin of the word doping is today still discussed; however some sources indicate that an African tribe, the Kaffirs, gave the name of \"dop\" to a beverage that was largely consumed in religious ceremonies as a stimulant drink. Diet modifications were among the most widely used procedures to increase physical performance in sports in the classical world. Beside diet measures, the assumption of \"magical\" potions deriving from the vegetable and animal realms to improve physical fitness and sportive performance is documented both in ancient Greece and Rome. The composition of these preparations is not yet fully clear, but they probably contained stimulants such as alcohol or hallucinating mushrooms. Vegetal stimulants were largely used in the nineteenth century, a period in which pharmacology and laboratory medicine were established and achieved remarkable scientific results. In the twentieth century different chronological and operative phases may be detected in the evolution of doping practices. To prevent these practices, from the sixties an intense struggle against doping in sports was begun at an international level. Doping in sports is unfair with respect to competitors and dangerous for health.",

      "abstract": "L’addiction aux drogues d’abus est un desordre psychiatrique caracterise par une consommation compulsive de toxiques, au detriment d’activites alternatives plus benefiques a long terme, et malgre les consequences negatives associees. Cette psychopathologie est ainsi de plus en plus conceptualisee comme le resultat d’une prise de decision pathologique, et l’un des plus grands enjeux de la recherche en addiction est de comprendre les bases neurobiologiques et physiopathologiques de ce dysfonctionnement. Devant les contraintes ethiques, techniques et pratiques inherentes aux etudes neurobiologiques chez l’homme, il est important d’utiliser en parallele des modeles animaux d’addiction. Malheureusement, la validite de la plupart de ces modeles est incertaine. En effet, la prise de drogue est bien trop souvent etudiee dans une situation ou la drogue est la seule recompense disponible. Ainsi, dans ces conditions, il est difficile de determiner si l’animal s’auto-administre une drogue par compulsion, ou simplement parce qu’il n’a pas d’autre activite alternative valable. Une serie d’experiences menees dans notre laboratoire depuis plusieurs annees a montre que lorsqu’un choix est donne entre une injection intraveineuse de cocaine ou d’heroine et un acces a une boisson sucree, la vaste majorite des rats preferent l’eau sucree. Une minorite de rats persevere cependant dans le choix de la drogue au detriment de l’acces a la boisson sucree, et constituerait ainsi une population d’individus vulnerables a l’addiction. Au cours de ma these, mon principal objectif a ete d’etudier les determinants du choix entre prise de drogue (cocaine et heroine) et recompense alternative. Mes travaux de recherche ont permis de determiner les mecanismes de choix utilises par le rat, en testant la validite predictive relative de plusieurs modeles de prise de decision. J’ai egalement contribue a la mise en evidence d’une interaction forte entre le contexte de choix, les effets directs de la drogue et les capacites cognitives specifiques au rat. Cette interaction exerce une influence considerable sur le choix de la drogue chez le rat. Cette decouverte pourrait conduire a une reinterpretation des experiences de choix menees chez le rat et souleve aussi des interrogations importantes sur la validite relative des procedures de choix pour modeliser l’addiction aux drogues.",

En Colombia, el programa presidencial RUMBOS estimo en 2001, que el 89.7% de los estudiantes universitarios eran consumidores habituales de alcohol etilico. Esta sustancia tambien es la mas utilizada en Colombia como sustancia de inicio para el consumo habitual de otras sustancias psicoactivas. El etanol cuando se consume en forma continuada y frecuente produce efectos adversos agudos y cronicos en la salud humana. En consumidores cronicos de alcohol, se han comprobado efectos adversos nutricionales, neurolo­gicos, hepaticos y teratogenicos. En intoxicacion aguda se pueden presentar alteraciones en el sistema nervioso central, gastroin­testinal, endocrino y en el equilibrio acido basico especialmente. El consumo de etanol tambien se ha asociado con la presentacion de varias alteraciones sociales como incremento en los indices de violencia intrafamiliar, violencia general, actos delictivos y accidentes de transito. Sus altos indices de consumo, su comprobado efecto toxico sobre la salud, sus repercusiones negativas sobre los roles sociales del individuo, unidos al hecho de ser una sustancia legal y socialmente aceptada, senalan el consumo incontrolado de bebidas alcoholicas como un verdadero problema de salud publica, sobre el cual es necesario llamar la atencion.",

The present case report describes an in vivo double-blind alteration of nicotine level for two long-term, heavy smokers.

It was concluded that other variables may play an equal or more important role than nicotine in governing smoking behavior in the natural setting.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most common illegal drug in Sweden today. It is used by millions of people all over the world and has been used for thousands of years. The purpose with this essay is to try to understand why people smoke cannabis. To be able to answer the main questions, five persons who smoke cannabis regularly have been interviewed. Information has also been obtained from prior research in the same subject and other literature. To increase the ability to understand and explain why the interviewees smoke cannabis the existential psychology has been used when the result of the interviewees have been analysed. The interviewees have said that smoking cannabis helps them to be able to relax and to calm down. They have also told things that has shown why they have difficulties relaxing. The conclusion of this study is that cannabis can be used to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. These feelings can arise when the individual stands in front of a choice in life or when he has difficulties in finding purpose and meaning in life. Poor self-image is the result when the individual is repeatedly dissatisfied with his efforts and this causes negative feelings to emerge. The individual can choose to try to run from these negative feelings by smoking cannabis.",

      "abstract": "It is well-known that cigarette smoking and the use of other addictive goods is harmful to health. Still, some people smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol in their daily life. The consumption of addictive goods seems, therefore, to be the anti-thesis of rational behavior. In this paper, however, it is demonstrated that a rational individual, in the sense that he maximizes his well-being while anticipating the future consequences of his choices, may in fact choose to consume addictive goods. Specifically, the two-good extension of the rational addiction model is demonstrated and related to relevant policy questions. For instance, should one encourage the use of smokeless tobacco in smoking cessation programs? According to the empirical results, the answer is no. Further, should one discourage smoking by increasing the tax on cigarettes? Again, the answer is no.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette consumption, excessive amounts of alcohol, poor and unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are just some of the common habits that impair human health in the long run. Tobacco smoke initially damages the respiratory system and then leaves consequences that cause the whole organism to suffer. The basic active pharmacological ingredient of tobacco is nicotine, one of the strongest poisons known to man, which causes addiction and the habit of smoking. Archaeological findings confirm that people drank and produced alcoholic beverages 30,000-40,000 years ago. Young people have a strong desire to become adults and mature as soon as possible and like to behave like adults, then they resort to forms of behavior that are forbidden to them and allowed to adults. The family, school and sports organizations play an important role in health education and learning about harmful habits, in order to protect and improve health. Alcohol consumption among young people can be part of experimentation as part of psychological development during adolescence, but it can also become a habit and lead to addiction and damage to health. It has been found that some people drink, not because they want to drink, but because there have been major personality changes that they cannot stop drinking so they have become addicted to alcohol. Many studies show that children start drinking very early, unaware of the consequences of alcohol. Determination of obesity is performed on the basis of body mass index, which is a criterion for obesity, when it is higher than 30 kg / m2. The European Office of the World Health Organization monitors the movement of overweight in Europe and the data show that Europe has been affected by an epidemic of obesity of similar dimensions as in the United States. On the epidemiological side, obesity has reached pandemic proportions with more than 700 million obese adults worldwide and is a growing public health problem with all the efforts that have been made. A survey on harmful habits among students was conducted for the purpose of writing the Final Thesis. The results of the survey show that 49% of respondents smoke cigarettes, citing: stress, boredom, habit and pleasure. As for alcohol consumption, 66% of respondents admitted that they sometimes enjoy drinking, most often wine or beer. Respondents mostly consume alcoholic beverages for the sake of company, going out and for pleasure. The results of student nutrition are very worrying. Namely, only 25% of the surveyed students said that they eat healthy, while the rest try to eat healthy. In the last question of the survey Which harmful habit did you start consuming the most due to pressure at college? We can see how as many as 60% of respondents started eating unhealthily.",

      "title": "Review of Effects of Alcohol and other Licit Drugs on Driving-Related Performance",
      "abstract": "A review is presented of the effects of alcohol and licit drugs on performance related to driving. About 20% of persons of driving age use some licit drug, while a much greater percentage drink alcohol. Alcohol is used in combination with another licit drug by about 10% of persons of driving age. Alcohol is associated with about 50% of fatal traffic accidents, 30% of injury accidents and 10% of non-injury accidents. Other licit drugs, such as diazepam, are involved in about 20% of non-fatal accidents. Alcohol combined with other licit drugs, such as diazepam, is involved in about 10% of injury accidents. The effects of alcohol on driving-related skills is relatively well-documented, but tests on the effects of other licit drugs present variable findings. There is some research which indicates additive or synergistic effects when alcohol is combined with other drugs. Research to date on the effects of licit drugs alone, and in combination with alcohol, has many limitations. There have been comparatively few studies to test decision-making and perceptual-motor skills, such as used in driving or those involving actual driving tasks. However, studies indicate that when combined with alcohol, some licit drugs lead to a deterioration in driving-related performance, but a need exists for further research involving more complex driving-related tests and actual driving situations.",

Die Studienteilnehmer sind je nach Grad der Nikotinabhangigkeit einer der zwei Gruppen, Raucher mit „keiner/masigen Nikotinabhangigkeit“ oder mit einer „deutlichen/starken Nikotinabhangigkeit“, zugeteilt worden. \r\nDabei stellte sich heraus, dass durchaus einige signifikante Unterschiede zwischen den stark und weniger stark nikotinabhangigen Rauchern existieren. \r\nEin ungesunder Lebensstil setzt sich aus Stress, Bewegungsmangel, fettreicher Ernahrung und dergleichen zusammen, wahrend hingegen ein gesundheitsforderliches Verhalten eine ausgewogene Ernahrung, korperliche Aktivitat, etc. beinhaltet. \r\nDie Nikotinabhangigkeit scheint dabei durchaus eine entscheidende Rolle zu spielen. So sind Auffalligkeiten, wie der Konsum einer risikotrachtigen Kost, eine geringere Bewegungsaktivitat, ein hoherer Alkoholkonsum und ein verminderter Verzehr von gesunden Nahrungs- und Genussmitteln bei den stark nikotinabhangigen Raucher festzustellen, was allesamt einem ungesunderen Lebensstil zuzuschreiben ist. Weniger stark nikotinabhangige Raucher scheinen einen gesunderen Lebensstil und ein damit verbundenes gesunderes Gesundheitsverhalten zu bevorzugen. \r\nStresssituationen sind in beiden Gruppen, den stark und weniger stark nikotinabhangigen Rauchern, Teil des Lebens. Die Verarbeitung von Stress verlauft jedoch nicht in allen Aspekten gleich. Es wird im Zuge dessen zwischen negative und positive Stressverarbeitungsstrategien unterschieden. Stark nikotinabhangige Raucher wenden stressvermehrende Verarbeitungsmoglichkeiten, anders Negativstrategien, haufiger an als die andere Gruppe der Probanden. Im Rahmen der Untersuchung der Positivstrategien sind keine derartigen Auswirkungen einer unterschiedlich haufigen Anwendung festzustellen.",

      "title": "Reduced–nicotine content cigarettes: Is there potential to aid smoking cessation?",
      "abstract": "Current smoking cessation treatments largely address pharmacological dependence on nicotine. New approaches are needed that address both nicotine dependence and psychological dependence on cigarettes as the source of nicotine. One such approach is the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content. We reviewed the available literature on the use of reduced–nicotine content cigarettes as a cessation aid. One case series study and trial data indicate that reduction in the level of nicotine in cigarette tobacco can reduce the level of nicotine dependence in smokers and do so without adverse effects on cardiovascular biomarkers or significant compensatory smoking. We identified three clinical trials (total n = 489) that suggest that smokers can dissociate nicotine delivery from the act of smoking if they use reduced–nicotine content cigarettes in combination with nicotine replacement therapy. The identified studies point to a benefit but involved only a small number of participants and provide only limited data on long-term abstinence. More definitive evidence from larger trials with longer follow-up is needed to clarify the role of reduced nicotine cigarettes as an aid to smoking cessation.",

When textbooks of pharmacology refer to alcohol, the substance cited is ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, the main alcohol present in alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, or hard liquors such as whiskey, gin, vodka, and brandy. The acute and chronic effects of beverage alcohol, ethanol, are widely held to be socially acceptable when consumed in moderation but are physically and criminally dangerous when consumed in excess consistently. Finding the scientifically validated boundary between acceptable moderate use and excessive consumption is a matter of individual metabolism, history of consumption, cultural environment, and, often, family history.",

      "abstract": "La guida di un autoveicolo, specie in condizioni di intenso traffico o di cattive condizioni meteoclimatiche, e considerata uno dei principali fattori stressanti della vita odierna. Durante la guida si possono infatti osservare significative risposte simpatoadrenergiche e cardiovascolari con la comparsa anche di episodi coronarici. Tali risposte presentano un’ampia variabilita interindividuale in quanto sono influenzate da vari fattori (stile di vita, personalita etc.). In questa rassegna, vengono presentati i principali risultati degli studi da noi condotti sulle risposte psicofisiologiche indotte dalla guida di diversi tipi di autoveicoli. In conducenti di autobus urbani e stato registrato un sensibile aumento del tasso urinario di adrenalina durante il turno lavorativo rispetto alla stessa fascia oraria di un giorno di riposo. Tale risposta adrenergica era esaltata dall’abitudine tabagica e dall’assunzione di caffe e bevande alcoliche. In soggetti che alla guida di camion coprono lunghe distanze, i piu elevati tassi urinari di catecolamine e i piu alti livelli di frequenza cardiaca sono stati registrati quando la guida era particolarmente stressante per la presenza di nebbia o di intenso traffico. In soggetti che partecipano, a livello amatoriale, a manifestazioni agonistiche di velocita su pista, abbiamo osservato che durante la gara, rispetto al periodo pre-gara, l’escrezione urinaria di catecolamine aumenta in misura molto rilevante. Analogamente a quanto osservato in autisti di camion, l’attivazione del sistema adrenergico e risultata direttamente associata ai livelli di ansieta. Dall’elettrocardiogramma dinamico e emerso che durante la gara la frequenza cardiaca raggiunge un valore medio di 163.5±7.4 battiti/min. (range: 146,180 battiti/min.). Un significativo peggioramento della percezione visiva stereoscopica, con potenziale ricaduta negativa sulla performance dei guidatori, e stato osservato in studenti universitari esposti per 5 ore al complesso dei fattori stressanti propri dell’ambiente della discoteca. In un recente studio condotto su autisti di autocarri abbiamo altresi osservato, al termine del turno di guida, un rilevante incremento del trombossano urinario che potrebbe rappresentare un marcatore di rischio cardiovascolare.",

Se consideran los efectos fisicos y psiquicos tras el consumo de Drogas. La adiccion supone la compulsion o tendencia impulsiva hacia la droga, en muchos casos como una necesidad fisica. El fenomeno de la tolerancia es el acostumbramiento a la droga de modo que el organismo necesita mayor cantidad para obtener el efecto. Las drogas se clasifican en opiaceos, alucinogenos, estimulantes, euforizantes, cannabinoides, etc. La utilizacion de drogas por las personas jovenes es un hecho frecuente, sobre todo el consumo de alcohol y marihuana. Ultimamente se ha incrementado el consumo de drogas de sintesis, lo que constituye una autentica epidemia en nuestro pais. Se ha estudiado las caracteristicas biopsicosociales por analisis de regresion. Se trata de varones, consumen alcohol y tabaco, con falta de creencias religiosas, con estado de animo negativo, con tendencias autodestructivas y sindrome de ruptura social. El tratamiento incluye detoxificacion, en el caso de los opiaceos con metadona, pero es muy importante la interaccion personal, lo que se logra en pequenas comunidades terapeuticas. Pero es fundamental una accion social para facilitar un medio ambiente propicio, con el soporte social, ya que el paro juvenil puede actuar como factor negativo, y facilitar la formacion para un trabajo adecuado. EnglishDrug dependence is considered a state of physical and psychological dependence which arises after administration of a drug. The drug itself determines the type and the extent of such dependence. Addiction means compulsion to take the drug plus evidence, in many cases, of physical need. Related to addiction is tolerance, or need to increase dosage to obtain a given effect. Drugs can be classified into opiates, hallucinogens, stimulants and euphoriants, cannabinoids, etc.. Drug use has become relatively frequent in young people, especially alcohol and marihuana consumption. In addition, drugs are often consumed in combination, being synthetic drugs a recent epidemic in Spain. Bio-psycho-social characteristics associated with drug use, as derived from a logistic regression analysis, are sex (males), alcohol and tobacco consumption, agnostic beliefs, self-destructive behavior, and social breakdown syndrome. Treatment approaches include detoxification, methadone, and personal interaction and behavior modification in small therapeutic communities. Lastly, social environments must be addressed to support social and work acceptance.",

      "title": "Making Decisions About Supplement Use",
      "abstract": "The use of dietary supplements is widespread among athletes in all sports and at all levels of competition, as it is in the general population. For the athlete training at the limits of what is sustainable, or for those seeking a shortcut to achieving their aims, supplements offer the prospect of bridging the gap between success and failure. Surveys show, however, that this is often not an informed choice and that the knowledge level among consumers is often low and that they are often influenced in their decisions by individuals with an equally inadequate understanding of the issues at stake. Supplement use may do more harm than good, unless it is based on a sound analysis of the evidence. Where a deficiency of an essential nutrient has been established by appropriate investigations, supplementation can provide a rapid and effective correction of the problem. Supplements can also provide a convenient and time-efficient solution to achieving the necessary intake of key nutrients such as protein and carbohydrate. Athletes contemplating the use of supplements should consider the potential for both positive and negative outcomes. Some ergogenic supplements may be of benefit to some athletes in some specific contexts, but many are less effective than is claimed. Some may be harmful to health of performance and some may contain agents prohibited by anti-doping regulations. Athletes should make informed choices that maximize the benefits while minimizing the risks.",

An altered state of consciousness is a kind of disassociation from ordinary consciousness, and can take on many different forms. Attaining altered states of consciousness is a hallmark of rites in primitive cultures, as well as urban charismatic churches. Altered states of consciousness can be induced in many different ways, from drugs to shamanic drumming to fasting, to dancing in discos with strobe lights. Substances used by various cultures to induce altered states of consciousness are: ayahuasca, tobacco, peyote, kava, alcohol, mead, qat, psychedelic drugs. There is extensive literature on the ceremonial use of peyote among Indians in the United States and Mexico, where its use extends back about 2000 years. Kava, a mild narcotic that has been a stimulantrelaxant- social drink throughout Oceania for at least a thousand years. Alcohol is a culturally accepted intoxicant used worldwide. The amphetamine-like drug, qat, is commonly chewed in Yemen on social occasions. Psychedelic states, induced by LSD and other drugs, have well known effects in terms of alteration of consciousness.",

Tais danos podem advir da fumaça e da nicotina, porém há também sintomas relacionados aos sabores implantados nesse tipo de cigarro. Na análise citada, cabe também ressaltar que alguns estudos foram contra o propósito do trabalho. Por fim, é importante salientar que os danos à saúde oriundos do cigarro eletrônico são semelhantes aos causados por tabacos convencionais, originando principalmente sintomas respiratórios e cardiovasculares. Além disso, existem outros estudos que defendem a substituição do tabaco convencional pelos cigarros eletrônicos. A ausência de pesquisas que discutam detalhadamente os efeitos a longo prazo do uso desses dispositivos impede o cálculo preciso da nocividade à saúde humana, tornando-se evidente a continuação e ampliação de estudos.",

Many of these signal depression. Most of the elderly who commit suicide do so not long after visiting a physician. Thus, responsibility for prevention lies not only with family and friends of the suicidal elderly person but with the physician as well.

Toxicity testing procedures used for the evaluation of chemical safety are enumerated. Misinterpretation of experimental studies and epidemiology studies are at the origin of these fears. Except for acute industrial accidents, suicide attempts and drug abuse the risk of poisoning is rather low. Often the excellent performances of modern analytical technologies are at the origin of many incorrect conclusions. The concept of acceptable daily intake, safety factors, relative risks of deaths and other safety issues are discussed.",

Anticipations of stimulant and sedative effects have not been investigated extensively. The present study examined the stimulant and sedative effects subjects anticipated experiencing if they were on the ascending or descending limb of the blood alcohol curve after consuming two or four standard drinks. One hundred sixty-six undergraduates reported anticipating greater stimulant effects than sedative effects on the ascending limb of the blood alcohol curve, and greater sedative effects than stimulant effects on the descending limb. Subjects also reported anticipating larger effects with larger doses. Men tended to anticipate smaller effects than women. These results support the notion that specific anticipated effects vary with dosage and the limb of blood alcohol curve, suggesting that the study of anticipated effects of alcohol should employ these variables.",

In this study, a qualitative descriptive method was used, namely a method carried out by observing and noting techniques because the source of information was taken by listening to oral narratives. Dopamine detox can be a way to reduce or limit activities that are considered enjoyable but can have bad effects if done excessively. For example using gadgets, playing video games, or even eating snacks. The goal of a dopamine detox is to reduce addiction by changing bad habits to be more productive. Basically, dopamine cannot be eliminated from the body, but we can control dopamine levels by temporarily eliminating unhealthy entertainment and having high levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels that are too high can reduce concentration so that we lose focus. People who need a dopamine detox are people who are addicted to negative things, so the term dopamine detox actually doesn't really aim to reduce dopamine, but rather directs it so that dopamine can be produced in a way that is healthier, beneficial, not damaging to health, not disturbing productivity and does not make us lazy.",

      "title": "Staying Healthy",
      "abstract": "To move towards recovery after a first episode of psychosis, patients must focus on both their mental and physical health. People with a serious mental illness are usually less healthy than those without such an illness. This may be because of the illness itself, fewer opportunities for health care, or unwanted effects of the medicines taken to treat mental illnesses. People with a long-lasting mental illness sometimes also deal with other issues, such as cigarette smoking, drug abuse, unhealthy eating habits, little exercise, and having few relationships with others. Even though it can be difficult at times, living a healthy lifestyle is necessary for patients to feel better and move towards recovery. In this chapter, we discuss problems sometimes faced by people with psychosis and ways to deal with and overcome these issues. Specifically, this chapter focuses on the importance of not smoking cigarettes, staying away from alcohol and drugs, having a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise, and having good social support from family and friends. One problem sometimes faced by people with psychosis is cigarette smoking. About one in five people in the general population in the United States (about 21%) smoke cigarettes. Fortunately, this percentage is now decreasing because of the growing awareness of the health risks posed by cigarette smoking. However, a large percentage of people with psychosis smoke. For example, most people with schizophrenia (between 50% and 90%) smoke cigarettes. What’s more, this percentage has not decreased in recent years. People with psychotic disorders also have smoking behaviors that can cause even greater harm. Some of these behaviors include smoking heavily—up to two or three packs a day—and smoking cigarettes down to the filter where the greatest concentration of nicotine is. Why are people with psychosis so likely to smoke, and to smoke so heavily? Most researchers believe that it is because of the relationship between cigarette smoking, nicotine, and the symptoms of psychosis (see Chapter 2 on What Are the Symptoms of Psychosis?). Nicotine is a drug that affects anyone who uses it. In most people, nicotine may slightly improve attention and memory.",

Dieting has been more common in recent years as more people strive to adhere to strict food plans in an effort to achieve their desired body weight and form. Unfortunately, this strategy may have unforeseen repercussions that could have a negative impact on one’s health. Insufficient calorie intake, for instance, might deprive the body of vital nutrients, resulting in malnutrition and a weakened immune system. Similar to too-restricted diets, irregular periods and even infertility can result from a disruption in the hormonal balance. Furthermore, dieting can lead to psychological distress, which in turn promotes disordered eating behaviors such as binge eating, purging, and other eating disorders. These disorders have the potential to have a long-term negative impact on physical and mental health, and in some situations, they may even be fatal. It’s important to exercise caution and knowledge when it comes to various diet regimens that are advertised on social media and online.",

Because these products are seen as a part of the cultural heritage, there is little enthusiasm for their regulation throughout South and South-East Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, etc. Nearly 80% of users live in these areas, which could negatively impact their social, physical, and emotional health. According to several studies, quitting smoking may make people crave smokeless tobacco even more. However, they began using smokeless tobacco as a recreational activity but ultimately developed physical health conditions like gastritis, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, mouth cancer, and carcinoma of the liver. Additionally, they had medical and mental illnesses like melancholy, addiction, stress, mental anguish, and even suicidal thoughts, among others. Since it is harmful, smokeless tobacco should be handled with care. Unfortunately, our policy has not been upgraded or even had the legislation and regulation system applied. In order to alleviate this susceptible problem for the betterment of the country, it is now vital to take emergency steps to concentrate on &amp; conduct preventive comprehensive action at every level from the government &amp; local concern authorities.",

In most organisations it is recognised that a total ban would be heavy‐handed and potentially disruptive. Recent developments show, however, that non‐smokers are becoming increasingly assertive in their demands for smoking control. Facilities managers, with their colleagues in the personnel department, will have to respond so that the right of non‐smokers to a pollution‐free working environment can be reconciled with the needs of smokers to indulge their addiction.",

Alcohol forms part of our cultural culture and, in general, an excessive permissiveness to the consumption -even an abusive one- of alcoholic drinks is to be observed. But, at the same time, everything redolent of alcoholism is rejected. On the one hand, there is an endeavour to bestow a nutritive value, even to protecting one’s health, on beer and wine in particular, and on the other, a significant social rejection of abuse is to be seen although there are difficulties in defining what abuse signifies. False popular beliefs that give alcohol a stimulant, calorific and nutritive function and with the ability to provide strength and to increase sexual appetite still persist. Important publicity campaigns with more or less concealed economic interests assist in maintaining these ideas. Alcoholic beverages continue to preoccupy politicians and professionals more that the general public who feel it to be one instrument more in their lives, associated most of all with times of relaxation, fun, company or solitude.",

      "title": "Marijuana use: neuroscience perspective",
      "abstract": "The human behavioral repertoire includes activities that influence mood and cognition such as listening to music, watching movies, conversation, and dining, behaviors considered within the normal spectrum; however, when we choose activities that predictably and reliably alter our mood and cognition by exposing our central nervous system to exogenous molecules, we enter the potentially pathological path of addiction. We, and others around us, begin to worry as these behaviors insidiously become dominant foci in our existence. We do not clearly understand why a given individual chooses to use recreational drugs (1). As a society, we interpret and judge substance use based on our cultural prejudices, current moral and legal standards, and established norms.\r\n\r\nToday, with varying levels of acceptance throughout the world, the four, most abused, psychoactive substances are: caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis. Often, when individuals abuse one of these substances, they eventually migrate to using all four. Cannabis recently has gained significant social acceptance. People believe cannabis is benign, has few significant detrimental brain effects, and is also non-addicting. These are false popular misconceptions (2). Although the human brain naturally produces and uses cannabis-like molecules, referred to as endocannabinoids, current scientific data show that marijuana’s externally administered substances directly influence behavior by affecting brain functions (3).\r\n\r\nThe human endogenous endocannabinoid system indicates that natural substances that contain cannabis-like molecules will interact with the nervous system through existing receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are present in the peripheral cells such as the immune cells and neurons of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, cerebellum, basal ganglia, periaqueductal gray, hippocampus, and neocortex (4). In the central nervous system, these neuronal receptors play a significant role in modulating behaviors and brain functions. Data suggest that cannabinoid receptors play a more direct role in brain functions such as pain modulation, motor activity, reduced rapid eye-movement sleep, as well as mood, motivation, and higher cognitive processes (5). Their impact may combine direct and indirect cellular and network effects. The cannabinoid system’s neurotransmitter molecules are atypically synthesized in the cellular membrane by a complex enzymatic process of dendritic lipid metabolism (receptive and integrative structure of the neurons) (6). Although they behave similarly to classical neurotransmitter systems, unlike many other classical neurotransmitters, these neurotransmitter molecules are not stored in specialized vesicles. Current published data suggest that the endocannabinoid nervous system’s primary effect is to influence neurotransmitter release through presynaptic modulations. Endocannabinoid receptors have been characterized in two different receptor types, type-1 and type- 2 (7,8). Type-1 receptors are primarily found in the central nervous system, whereas type-2 receptors are thought to be primarily distributed to the peripheral system. Current data also show that type-1 receptors are closely associated with excitatory neurotransmitters. Based on how these receptors relatively distribute within a given system that contains inhibitory and excitatory neurons, type-1 receptor activation may cause either inhibition or excitation that may translate to physiologic seizure inhibition or facilitation, which is considered pathological neuronal activity (9,10). Receptor distribution may vary from person to person; therefore, based on cannabis use, we may expect individually defined, variable effects that eventually translate into unexpected behaviors.\r\n\r\nMarijuana and marijuana extracts are not only used recreationally: cannabis has a long history of medical treatment of various medical and neurological illnesses. Although recently it has gained the attention of research, the biochemical analysis of marijuana’s bioactive extracts is moving forward; this may give researchers significant understanding of the endocannbinoid system and how to develop new therapeutic agents that target that system. Already, significant advances have been made in managing chronic pain, glaucoma, head injury inflammatory disorders, and nausea, to mention a few (11).\r\n\r\nDespite marijuana’s tremendous medical potential, this drug’s recreational use presents medical and social problems (12-14). Recreational cannabis use has significantly increased throughout the world (15). As marijuana’s public acceptance increases, the age of marijuana exposure decreases. In the US, data indicate that while nicotine use has decreased among college students, cannabinoid use has increased. In the light of these findings, we must ask ourselves whether there are significant consequences for chronic cannabis use. We also need to ask about the frequency of cannabis use and its direct impact on brain function. In recent years, as marijuana’s quality has improved, the higher cannabinoid concentration has resulted in significantly increased potency. Cannabinoid concentration has increased up to five times, which has increased its biological effect on the brain and, more significantly, endangered vulnerable individuals.\r\n\r\nEmerging behavioral and imaging data argue against recreational marijuana use because they show a relationship between the age of first use and the intensity of measurable consequences. Individuals who routinely use marijuana have significantly altered brain structures and functions with significantly altered cognition and mood regulation. Relative to non users, chronic marijuana users generally underperform in memory and cognitive tasks; in addition, chronic marijuana users may develop significant mood deregulation that presents as depression, anxiety, and may result in long-lasting amotivational syndrome. Current data are unclear about the duration of these effects. More alarming data argue that some chronic marijuana users can develop psychosis that, in some cases, may lead to significant chronic psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders (16).\r\n\r\nWho are these vulnerable individuals? Although we have limited data regarding this issue, some trends are emerging. Indeed, it appears that a subpopulation of individuals may be particularly vulnerable to marijuana use. In these individuals, certain brain molecules have altered genetic regulation of certain neurotransmitters that include dopamine (17). This makes these individuals more likely to develop psychosis and potentially more vulnerable to developing chronic mental illness because these brain molecules help eliminate dopamine after its release. In addition to genetic vulnerability, it appears there is a well-defined window linked to age: Individuals who engaged in heavy marijuana use before age 17 are five times more likely to abuse other substances later in life (18). Furthermore, these vulnerabilities indicate that marijuana use may lead to future cognitive difficulty such as lower IQ and psychiatric symptoms (19).\r\n\r\nMany researchers would agree that pre-teen, teen, and young adult marijuana use may be significantly detrimental to brain development and, consequently, to successful participation in life. Emerging data show that chronic marijuana users performed poorly in school, often found themselves in conflict with the law, and did not progress as expected in developing their interests and careers. One proposed hypothesis states that marijuana use leads to decreased motivation and decreased ability to focus, pay attention, form memories, and solve complex problems. It is becoming clear that chronic marijuana use impacts emotions as well as cognition and affects structures such as the hippocampus, critical for memory formation and retrieval; the amygdala, critical for the emotional brain; and the frontal lobes, critical for the executive brain (20).\r\n\r\nLastly, but not surprisingly, recreational marijuana use and other substance use such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol may significantly impair the performance and socially beneficial activity of our youth. As the youth become young adults and attempt to manage new challenges and the responsibilities of independence, they often face significant periods of stress. Their successful transition through these periods requires cognitive and emotional stability. Without these resources, when they face challenges, young adults often seek easy immediate solutions. If substance use is in their historical behavioral repertoire, they turn to substances for relief and as a solution for their problems. These behaviors tend to be strongly reinforcing and often result in a viscous cycle of addiction. Unfortunately, we currently cannot predict who will withstand the challenges addiction, who will move-on unharmed, or who may be doomed to lifelong struggles and significant psychiatric sequels.\r\n\r\nIt appears we cannot prevent experimentation with addictive substances; however, we can invest in effective biological education about addiction and its potential consequences. We also need to have open, honest, evidence-based, public, conversations that address the individual risks of substance use and abuse.",

Tobacco use has been linked to a wide variety of health consequences including numerous types of cancer, emphysema, and COPD. Despite the well-documented health consequences associated with using tobacco products, some individuals continue to smoke, while others believe that use of newer, more trendy products (e.g., e-cigarettes) are associated with little to no health risk. No matter what form of tobacco product an individual chooses to use, nicotine is highly addictive and is difficult to stop using. Considering that most people begin using tobacco before the age of 18, prevention efforts are important if we are to make further progress in combating this major health concern. Many different treatment modalities exist for those wishing to quit; however, most tobacco users relapse within the first 14 days of making a quit attempt. For this reason, it is important that we continue to improve our current knowledge base regarding tobacco cessation.",

Adolescents tend to lack insight into problems that result from substance use. CRAFFT is a simple and reliable screening tool for SUD in adolescents. Treatment generally consists of counseling. Intimate partner violence is more common among women with SUD and those whose partners have SUD. During pregnancy, alcohol is the drug most damaging to the fetus. Treatment programs developed specifically for women may be beneficial. Most SUD in older adults are related to alcohol, but opioid use is increasing, with associated risk of overdose fatality. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals appear to be at increased risk for SUD. LGBTQ youth in particular have high rates of physical and sexual abuse, leading to high rates of opioid use disorder. Few programs specifically deliver LGBTQ-sensitive substance use treatment. At the time of incarceration, many arrestees test positive for illicit drugs or alcohol and perceive a need for treatment, but few receive it. Without medication for opioid use disorder while incarcerated, the risk of fatal opioid overdose soon after release is high. With regard to health professionals, the prevalence of alcohol use disorder is similar to that for the general population, although illicit drug use is less common. Medical societies have implemented programs to address SUD in the health professions.",

      "abstract": "Everyone is seeking nutritional strategies that might benefit performance. One approach receiving much attention is ketones, or ketosis. Ketones are very simple compounds made of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, and ketosis is a metabolic state whereby the body uses predominantly ketones. Ketosis can be achieved by fasting for longer than 72 hours or by following a very lowcarbohydrate, high-fat diet (ketogenic diet) for several days to weeks. Alternatively, ketone supplements purportedly induce ketosis rapidly and do not require strict adherence to any specific type of diet; however, much of the touted benefits are anecdotal. A potential role for ketosis as a performance enhancer was first introduced in 1983 with the idea that chronic ketosis without caloric restriction could preserve submaximal exercise capability by sparing glycogen or conserving the limited carbohydrate stores. Few human studies on the effects of a ketogenic diet on performance have yielded positive results, and most studies have yielded equivocal or null results, and a few negative results. Many questions about ketones relevant to Special Operations Forces (SOF) remain unanswered. At present, a ketogenic diet and/or a ketone supplement do not appear confer performance benefits for SOF. Instead, Operators should engage with their unit dietitian to develop individualized nutritional strategies based on unique mission requirements. The authors review the concept of a ketogenic diet, describe some potential benefits and risks of ketosis, review the performance literature and how to measure ketone status, and then summarize the landscape in 2017.",

In humming practices like Bhramari pranayama (normal inhalation followed by lengthened exhalation + bee-like humming), there is a full-mouth closure,1 and in practices like OM chanting (normal inhalation followed by lengthened exhalation +OM humming), there is a near-closure. Besides these, other mantra-oriented practices also generate a similar humming effect.",

      "abstract": "De Toelaatbare Dagelijkse Inname (TDI) is de inname van een stof waarbij, bij levenslange blootstelling, geen nadelige effecten op de gezondheid verwacht mag worden. De afleiding van de TDI is vaak gebaseerd op de extrapolatie van bij proefdieren waargenomen toxiciteit naar de mens. Deze extrapolatie bestaat uit correcties voor verschillen in toxicokinetiek (opname, verdeling, uitscheiding) en toxicodynamie (toxisch werkingsmechanisme) tussen proefdieren en de mens Hierbij wordt er standaard vanuit gegaan dat verschillen in toxicokinetiek tussen mens en proefdier niet meer dan een factor 4 bedragen. De afleiding van de TDI voor de dioxine 2,3,7,8-TetraChloroDibenzo-p-Dioxine (TCDD) laat echter zien dat het toepassen van deze factor tot een TDI leidt die de gezondheid onvoldoende beschermt. De belangrijkste reden hiervoor is dat verschillen in de toxicokinetiek van TCDD tussen proefdier en mens veel groter zijn dan de genoemde standaardfactor. De toxicokinetiek van Persistente Organische Milieuverontreinigingen als TCDD, maar ook PolyBroom DiphenylEthers en Perfluorverbindingen, moet daarom expliciet in de afleiding van de TDI opgenomen worden. In navolging van TCDD is dit principe op tetrabroom BDE- 47 toegepast. Voor BDE-47 bleken de ontwikkeling van het centraal zenuwstelsel uitmondend in verstoorde gedragsontwikkeling en een verstoorde schildklierfunctie de gevoeligste vormen van diertoxiciteit. Wanneer met de onzekerheid bij het afleiden van de TDI rekening gehouden wordt kan op basis van deze effecten een voorlopige TDI van 7 ng/kg bw/day berekend worden.",

      "title": "Salsolinol-like compounds as biomarkers of human alcohol consumption, disease and toxicity",
      "abstract": "Introduction. The use, misuse, and abuse of ethanol, man's oldest drug, has constituted a major public health concern. Ethanol use is a contributing factor for more than 200 diseases, making it perhaps man's most dangerous drug. Paradoxically, moderate alcohol consumption has beneficial effects and may prevent heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. There is much debate on what constitutes a \"safe\" dose of alcohol. The human body has evolved to be able to handle relatively high doses of alcohol and it is often considered a food rather than a drug. Thus, the pharmacological effects of a single recreational dose of ethanol wear off relatively quickly, yet the physiological consequences of chronic dosing may last a lot longer, or even be permanent. Alcohol's proximal metabolite, acetaldehyde, is a highly toxic compound that reacts with many different biomolecules and may be a direct causative agent for dementia and cancer. Acetaldehyde and brain catecholamines, which are important neurotransmitters, may react to form tetrahydroisoquinoline compounds, which are toxic chemicals that have been linked to neurodegeneration and the disruption of glucose metabolism. The objective of this research was to further elucidate our understanding of the formation and behavior of tetrahydroisoquinoline compounds. To this end, we have developed a combined method for detection of catecholamines and tetrahydroisoquinolines by LC-MS/MS.",

      "title": "A prática do mindfulness em grupo para dependentes de crack internados",
      "abstract": "O crack e uma droga derivada da cocaina, um estimulante do sistema nervoso central, que pode ser injetada ou aspirada, ou ainda convertida na sua forma alcalina, a pasta basica ou crack. Com alto potencial dependogeno, o crack produz complicacoes decorrentes do seu uso, que vao desde o calor e rubor, tremores incontrolaveis, desmaios e convulsoes, ate a overdose, problemas cardiovasculares, respiratorios, promiscuidade sexual, suicidios, homicidios e quadros psiquiatricos. O primeiro relato de consumo de crack no Brasil ocorreu na cidade de Sao Paulo, no ano de 1989. Nos ultimos 20 anos se pode observar um crescimento significativo do consumo de crack em todo o Brasil, e atualmente, os casos de dependencia ja sao responsaveis por 70% das internacoes por cocaina. Por ser uma droga relativamente nova, o conhecimento que se tem a respeito do seu tratamento ainda e escasso, o que tem feito com que as politicas publicas de prevencao e tratamento sejam ainda insuficientes. Entre os maiores desafios que os servicos de saude tem enfrentado no tratamento de dependentes de crack estao a fissura e os sintomas de ansiedade. O craving ou fissura e um desejo intenso de utilizar uma determinada substância, e esta entre os principais motivos que levam os dependentes de substâncias psicoativas como o crack a recairem e abandonarem a terapia. O transtorno ansioso, que tem como principais sintomas a inquietacao motora, sudorese, taquicardia, angustia, e mal estar generalizado, e outro problema relacionado ao uso abusivo de drogas. Isto porque os ansiosos tendem a buscar alivio para a ansiedade em drogas como a maconha, crack, opio e morfina. O que se tem preconizado como tratamento mais eficaz para os dependentes de crack e o uso concomitante de medicacao e terapia cognitiva ou comportamental. Dentre as tecnicas utilizadas pelas terapias cognitivas e comportamentais para o manejo da fissura e da ansiedade esta a pratica de mindfulness. O termo mindfulness refere-se a uma consciencia sincera, de momento a momento, nao julgadora. Com suas raizes em tradicoes como o budismo, yoga e taoismo, ela consiste na atencao, no momento presente, a todos os eventos internos ou externos, sem qualquer julgamento ou resistencia. Tendo como objetivos o aumento da aceitacao e a diminuicao da evitacao das experiencias internas, sua pratica pode ser resumida como a percepcao sem julgamentos de sensacoes corporais, pensamentos, emocoes, imagens, sons, cheiros e gostos. Ha praticas formais de mindfulness como a meditacao, o yoga, o chi kung e o tai chi chuang, e outras nao formais, que consistem na atencao plena em qualquer atividade cotidiana como comer, caminhar, lavar louca, ou outra. Apesar de estar ligado a diversas tradicoes religiosas, o mindfulness vem sendo praticado tambem fora do contexto religioso, tendo como principal beneficio desta dissociacao a democratizacao da sua pratica. Na decada de 1970, na Stress Reduction Clinic, se comecou a utilizar a pratica de mindfulness em programas de reducao do estresse. Apos os resultados positivos observados nestes programas, diversos terapeutas cognitivos e comportamentais vem tambem estudando e adotando este modelo de intervencao. A rapida absorcao desta tecnica por parte dos terapeutas cognitivos e comportamentais pode ser explicada pelo fato da nocao do mindfulness estar ja anteriormente e de forma implicita presente nas praticas clinicas tradicionais das terapias cognitivas e comportamentais. Na considerada terceira onda das terapias comportamentais ha diversas abordagens que adotaram a tecnica mindfulness, destacando-se a terapia de aceitacao e compromisso (ACT); a terapia comportamental dialetica (TCD); a terapia cognitivo-comportamental baseada na aceitacao (TCBA); e a terapia cognitivo-comportamental baseada em mindfulness e aceitacao. Atualmente se vem utilizando a pratica de mindfulness nao somente nos programas de reducao do estresse, mas tambem no tratamento de outras patologias como o Transtorno de Ansiedade Generalizada, Transtorno de Pânico, dores cronicas, depressao, e como prevencao da recaida com dependentes quimicos. O objetivo deste trabalho e apresentar a experiencia da realizacao de um grupo de mindfulness para dependentes de crack internados em uma unidade especializada para dependencia quimica. O grupo de mindfulness e realizado com frequencia semanal com duracao de 30 minutos e sao convidados a participar todos os pacientes dependentes de crack que estejam entre 5 e 15 dias em abstinencia, que nao apresentem sintomas psicoticos e que tenham condicoes fisicas e cognitivas para participar desta intervencao. Participam de 5 a 10 pacientes, do sexo masculino, entre 18 e 65 anos de idade, e o grupo e dividido da seguinte forma: 1- exercicios de alongamento; 2- explicacao da respiracao diafragmatica e da postura corporal para a pratica de mindfulness; 3- aplicacao da tecnica; 4- psicoeduacao do grupo a respeito da tecnica; 5- solicitacao de feedback aos pacientes. Na fase 1 sao adaptados 5 exercicios de alongamento do Lian Gong, um dos sistemas da ginastica terapeutica chinesa, com o objetivo de preparar o corpo dos participantes para a pratica de mindfulness. Na fase 2 e solicitado que os participantes sentem-se confortavelmente nas cadeiras, mantendo a coluna ereta, os ombros relaxados, o dorso das maos repousando sobre as pernas ou joelhos, o pescoco relaxado com o queixo ligeiramente para dentro, a lingua no palato, e os olhos fechados ou semiabertos. E, ainda, solicitado aos participantes que se mantenham em completo silencio e com o corpo imovel durante toda a pratica. Na fase 3 e aplicada a tecnica propriamente dita. Uma das meditacoes utilizadas e a atencao plena na respiracao, que e feita atraves da conducao verbal do terapeuta, mais ou menos da seguinte forma: torne-se consciente da sua respiracao, percebendo o ar entrar e sair enquanto voce respira; sinta a sua barriga subir quando o ar entra e descer quando sai; procure nao controlar a respiracao, apenas a observe passivamente; se pensamentos ou sentimentos surgirem em sua mente, nao tente suprimi-los nem os ignore, simplesmente observe-os; entao, volte para a percepcao da respiracao e do movimento da barriga, usando-as como âncoras; caso os mesmos pensamentos surjam de forma persistente, apenas os observe, sem julgar, e volte para a respiracao; perceba os pensamentos como nuvens passageiras, que vem e vao; procure nao lutar contra eles; sempre que sua mente, por qualquer motivo, se afastar da respiracao, traga-a suavemente de volta; para terminar a meditacao, mexa levemente os pes, as maos, se espreguice, abra os olhos, e permaneca por um minuto ou mais ainda em silencio. Ao termino, na fase 4, e explicado que esta tecnica pode auxiliar na impulsividade, no manejo da fissura e na diminuicao dos sintomas da ansiedade, funcionando como estrategia para a prevencao da recaida. Os pacientes tem relatado no feedback diminuicao significativa da fissura e dos sintomas de ansiedade durante a realizacao da tecnica. Alem disso, verbalizam que conseguem relaxar e percebem que a tecnica pode ser util apos a alta em situacoes de risco de recaida. Recomenda-se que a pratica de mindfulness seja utilizada como coadjuvante no tratamento dos dependentes de crack, e que mais pesquisas sejam feitas a este respeito.",

      "title": "The impact of preparing food in aluminum cookware on human health – a literature review",
      "abstract": "Introduction. Aluminum is an element commonly found in the environment. It is used in various industrial sectors, for example as a manufacturing material for food-grade utensils. Aim. The aim of this scientific paper is to answer to the question of whether people expose their health to the harmful effects of aluminum by utilising these types of items for preparing and storing food. Description of the state of knowledge. Aluminum has a proven noxious impact on the human body. Due to its neurotoxic properties, it may induce clinical symptoms. Excessive exposure to this element is also associated with the occurrence of bladder and lung cancer, while the connection with breast tumours remains debatable. Additionally, aluminum can be harmful to our health, as a component of some medical preparations. Conclusions. It is crucial to emphasise the necessity of complying with the amounts of aluminum consumption recommended by international institutions. Short-term use of aluminum pots does not pose a threat to our well-being. Also, long-term usage in most cases does not lead to exceeding the aluminum consumption standards, although children may be at risk. However, it is good practice to avoid cooking acidic products in aluminum utensils. Furthermore, it is worth washing the dishes according to the manufacturers’ recommendations and replacing them with new ones every few years. In addition, some scientists suggest choosing pots made of different materials, e.g. titanium. Moreover, a noticeable decrease in the levels of vitamin B1 and C in food prepared in aluminum dishes may be one of the reasons for their lower nutritional value, however this issue should be examined further. Keywords: aluminum; cooking and eating utensils; food safety; neurotoxicity.",

      "title": "Askese in der Konsumgesellschaft",
      "abstract": "Bei immer mehr Personen findet eine Masigung oder die komplette Abstinenz gegen-uber bestimmten Lebens- und Genussmitteln Einzug in den Alltag. Scheinbar wehren wir uns zunehmend gegen die Verlockungen der Warenwelt. So ist seit einiger Zeit auch ein Ruckgang des Konsums tierischer Produkte, Alkohol sowie Nikotin zu verzeichnen. Dabei stellt sich die Frage nach den Ursachen dieser Entwicklung, ob eine asketische Philosophie dahinter steckt oder die Grunde eher profaner Natur sind. Um diese Motive und auch weitere Hintergrunde des Verzichts sowie deren Entwicklungen genauer zu untersuchen, wurden Beitrage aus Online-Foren ausgewertet.\r\nDiese Untersuchungsform hat den Vorteil, dass Meinungen und Diskurse abrufbar sind, welche schon ein vergleichsweise beachtliches Alter aufweisen. Die Erhebung muss also nicht zehn Jahre im Vorfeld geplant und durchgefuhrt werden, sondern kann deutlich spontaner und in einem relativ kurzen Zeitraum erfolgen. Da das Internet im Jahre 2003 bereits recht stark verbreitet war, konnten auch Beitrage aus diesem Jahr bzw. den drauffolgenden Jahren herangezogen werden. Diese wurden dann mit Beitragen vergli-chen, die rund zehn Jahre alter sind. Von besonderem Interesse war dabei, ob sich Ge-meinsamkeiten zwischen den drei Arten der Abstinenz finden lassen.\r\nBezuglich der Beweggrunde zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass gesundheitliche Bedenken ei-nen wesentlicher Faktor darstellen, aber auch der gesellschaftliche Druck und vor allem das nahe Umfeld konnen Personen zu Verzicht und Masigung bewegen. Bei Alkohol und Nikotin ist es auch haufig die Befurchtung, man konnte bei ubermasigem Konsum abhangig werden. Es sind also hauptsachlich pragmatische Uberlegungen, durch welche der Konsum dieser Produkte in heutiger Zeit gezugelt wird. Von Askese kann nur in den seltensten Fallen die Rede sein, etwa beim Fleischverzicht fur das Wohl der Tiere.\r\nIm Zeitverlauf ist erkennbar, dass Abstinenz uberwiegend positiv konnotiert wird und dieses Verhalten auch weiterhin zunimmt. Durch den Verweis auf den gesunden Men-schenverstand versuchen vor allem Befurworter des Verzichts Andersdenkende zu stigmatisieren, (pseudo-)wissenschaftliche Fakten nutzen hingegen beide Seiten, um ihre Argumente zu untermauern. Hedonistische Bekundungen werden insgesamt deutlich seltener, in Form von Gegenreaktionen dafur aber umso starker. Der Ton ist nun insge-samt rauer und die Fronten verharten sich deutlich. Die Reaktionen gegen die zuneh-mende Selbstverstandlichkeit des freiwilligen Verzichts konnten als eine Art Abwehr-verhalten gegenuber des allmahlichen Paradigmenwandels verstanden werden, im Zuge dessen sich die Sicht auf den Konsum bestimmter Produkte bei vielen Menschen zu-nehmend von einem Privileg in eine Bedrohung wandelt.",

Drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, also appear to cause long-term physical alterations in the brain that may make it very difficult for them to merely change their minds about using drugs. In a discussion of these kinds of physical alterations at the molecular level, there is a great deal of detail and jargon. Added detail and extra jargon were saved for the figure legends and bracketed comments and can be ignored by those uninterested in the details.",

A drug or medication prescribed by a doctor should be taken as per the schedule, but consuming a particular food item at the same time may be fatal due to the food-drug interaction. This study reviewed the identified literature for twenty years and discussed the latest knowledge on food and drug interaction. The objective of this review study is to consider the details of the interactions between two essential eatable items and to analyze both sides, good and bad. In the narrative review study where the publications cited from the last twenty years of original research and review articles based on relevant keywords. Potential commonly consumed foods and highly recommended daily medicines as drugs have been considered. The study analyzed that so many foods are having adverse effects on the human body while interacting or reacting with some medication. Foods and drugs are both mandatory, but the concerned patient must select the right foods by a dietitian and the drug based on prescription by a doctor. The knowledge of food and drug interactions is undoubtedly compulsory to avoid health hazards and further complications.",

Waterpipe (also known as shisha or hookah) use has increased dramatically during the past decade, mostly due to its improved taste, lack of regulations and social acceptability as a safer option than cigarettes. However, recent clinical and experimental studies indicate that waterpipe use is as, or even more, harmful than cigarettes. Although they differ in the method of consumption, waterpipe tobacco has similar deleterious constituents found in cigarettes but are generated at greater amounts. These constituents are known to induce oxidative stress and inflammation, the major underlying mechanisms of a wide array of chronic pathological conditions. We review the relationship between waterpipe tobacco use and oxidative stress and the disease potential of waterpipe use.",

Despite this tradition, there is no strong empirical support for such an approach. Recent work has argued that exercise suffers from a “branding problem” and efforts to promote exercise may be better served by switching the focus from the long-term benefits of exercise that improve health, to the immediate benefits of exercise that enhance quality of life. One way to disseminate and reinforce this message could be through a smartphone application designed to monitor daily improvements on quality of life constructs correlated with exercise participation.",

Chew the gum isn’t bring solely stripling pleasure, in near future ‘chewing gum’ perhaps use as a part of the drug delivery system. Unfortunately, it has also produced some negative effects. Modern chewing gum is made by non-biodegradable hydrophobic polymer together with artificial sweetener and flavour.

Again, because of our irresponsible attitude to toss the waste part of chewing gum anywhere creates some kind of serious environmental litter known as ‘gum pollution’.

      "abstract": "What is known and objective Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are battery-powered devices that allow nicotine and/or other substances to be inhaled in aerosolized form. e-Cigarettes (electronic cigarettes), the most commonly used ENDS, have been proposed to be smoking cessation aids. However, despite the rapid surge in their popularity, little is known about long-term health consequences of e-cigarette usage. We assess published data to see if they deliver what they promise. Comment e-Cigarettes may contain uncertain quantities of various ingredients, and evidence of adulteration has been identified. Flavouring agents can alter the pharmacokinetics of nicotine and have uncertain impact on the nature of e-cigarette use (eg ab initio use vs smoking cessation). What is new and conclusion Although e-cigarettes have been proposed to be a safe approach to encouraging smoking cessation, there are inconsistencies in available data. And further data are needed regarding long-term implications of primary and secondary exposure to e-cigarette products.",

      "title": "Eight (Plus Two) Musings from Reading This Issue",
      "abstract": "1. Exercise after burn and weight loss — all hype or are there benefits? It seems that every new ad and associated exercise routine is expounding its effect on creating an extended caloric burn long into the postexercise period and therefore is “the” activity one should undertake to lose weight. This issue’s Health and Fitness from A to Z column written by Blaine E. Arney, M.S., ACSM-EP; Carl Foster, Ph.D., FACSM; and John Porcari, Ph.D., FACSM, takes a deep dive into excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and provides information that will be helpful to you as you work with and guide your clients. So be sure to read “EPOC: Is It Real? Does It Matter?” 2. Water: an underutilized exercise medium. Although many people struggle with land-based exercise activities because of obesity, musculoskeletal challenges, and other chronic health conditions, shallow and/or deepwater exercise may be the best option from which to derive health and fitness benefits. Elizabeth F. Nagle, Ph.D., FACSM; Mary E. Sanders, Ph.D., CDE, FACSM; and Bruce E. Becker, M.D., FACSM, share a variety of insights and practical water-based applications in their feature article, “Aquatic Exercise for Health: Probing the Depths of HIIT for Cardiometabolic Training.” 3. Chronic pain: a distinctive condition across individuals, yet physical activity is critical for all. Chronic pain is a challenging and at times disabling condition that can easily result in extended periods of physical inactivity. Yet, people with chronic pain need to move, and working with this group of people can be quite rewarding as fitness professional Anthony Carey has discovered. Learn more about Carey’s Function First approach and other career building experiences in this issue’s Celebrate Success! column written by Dixie Stanforth, Ph.D., FACSM, and Kelsey Graham, M.Ed. 4. Are your clients distracted exercisers, eaters? In today’s fast-paced, get-it-done society, many people become victims of mindless eating and exercise routines. Janet Buckworth, Ph.D., FACSM, shares some thoughts and tips regarding the importance of being mindful in all that we do. I am sure you will enjoy reading this issue’s Enhancing Your Behavioral Toolkit column: “Be Here Now: Mindful Eating and Exercise.” This column brought out a bit of the guilty side in me. 5. The seated cable row: Do your clients do this exercise correctly? Peter Ronai, M.S., FACSM, ACSM-CEP, ACSM-EP, EIM III, in this issue’s Do It Right column discusses and demonstrates how to correctly teach the seated cable row exercise to your clients. Although a common and relatively simple exercise, it is frequently performed incorrectly. In addition to reading the column, you will want to visit the journal’s web site and view the video content on this and other Do It Right exercises. 6. Promoting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans: a shared responsibility. With the release of the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines, the National Physical Activity Plan Alliance has identified nine key societal sectors for active promotion of physical activity. Learn more about the role health and fitness professionals are encouraged to play by reading this issue’s Clinical Applications column: “Strategies for Partnering with Health Care Settings to Increase Physical Activity Promotion.” Nicely written by Kristi McClary King, Ph.D., CHES; Jason R. Jaggers, Ph.D., FACSM; and Kupper Wintergest, M.D., you will garner a few insights into connecting with health-care providers. 7. Ultraendurance events and hydration: How much is enough? Over the past decade, participation in ultraendurance events has consistently increased. However, some people are unprepared for such events, both from a physical training perspective and by not having a well-thought-out hydration and fuel plan. Thus, the risk of dehydration and in some cases exercise-associated hyponatremia is dramatically increased. Michael Corcoran, Ph.D., and David Ayotte, M.S., CSCS, discuss the importance of having an individualized hydration plan for ultraendurance events and provide guidance toward developing a personalized plan in their feature article, “Individualized Hydration Plans for Ultra-Distance Endurance Athletes.” 8. The quality of your resume does matter. Far too many resumes are full of errors that make the applicant less attractive to invite for an interview than those that have been diligent in their preparation. If you are considering a new opportunity or have a resume in need of revision, be sure to read this issue’s Take Ten column elegantly penned by James A. Peterson, Ph.D., FACSM. It is insightful and thought-provoking as always. 9. A big thank you. Since its launch in 2016, Janet Buckworth, Ph.D., FACSM, has shared a wealth of practical information through her Enhancing Your Behavioral Toolkit column that has expanded our coaching knowledge base. This issue’s column will be the last one penned by Dr. Buckworth, and I am grateful for the service she has provided to ACSM’s Health and Fitness Journal.® So, thank you Dr. Buckworth for sharing your expertise and insights with us. 10. And, welcome: Yes, the Enhancing Your Behavioral Toolkit column will continue as Liz Hathaway, Ph.D., M.P.H., M.Ed., steps into the associate editor role beginning with the November/December 2019 issue. Dr. Hathaway is an assistant professor in the Department of Health and Human Performance at the University of Tennessee and was one of the feature article authors in the 2017 themed Behavioral Change issue.

      "title": "Consumo intensivo de alcohol y actividad prefrontal en adolescentes: impulsividad y control ejecutivo",
      "abstract": "En las ultimas decadas ha adquirido especial relevancia, entre los jovenes y adolescentes, el patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol, el cual presenta alta prevalencia en la mayoria de los paises occidentales. En la literatura anglosajona se denomina binge drinking (BD) y se caracteriza por la ingesta de grandes cantidades de alcohol en un corto periodo de tiempo, normalmente el fin de semana, que suele llevar a la embriaguez, y alternando periodos de abstinencia entre los episodios de consumo intensivo. El consumo intensivo de alcohol (CIA) parece resultar significativamente mas danino para el cerebro que su consumo regular, y mayores aun son las implicaciones al tratarse de poblacion juvenil. El cortex prefrontal, soporte neuronal de los procesos ejecutivos y de los rasgos de personalidad, parece resultar especialmente afectado por el consumo de alcohol. Aspectos como la desinhibicion o la impulsividad, plausiblemente mediado por la actividad neuronal en los circuitos prefrontales se han considerado como una consecuencia habitual del consumo de alcohol; sin embargo esta misma impulsividad puede representar un indicador de vulnerabilidad para la adiccion al alcohol y otras sustancias. El objetivo general de este estudio es determinar las relaciones existentes entre el consumo intensivo de alcohol en jovenes y su actividad prefrontal, estimada a partir de su rendimiento neuropsicologico y su perfil de personalidad. Los resultados obtenidos nos permiten establecer las siguientes conclusiones: Existen diferencias en el perfil de personalidad entre los jovenes CIA y No CIA. El perfil de personalidad de los sujetos CIA permite explicar aspectos relacionados con el consumo de alcohol. De este perfil, el factor desinhibicion es el que mejor explica estas conductas. El mayor consumo de alcohol se asocia con mas errores atencionales y disminucion de la velocidad de procesamiento, pero no con menor rendimiento en memoria de trabajo u otras funciones ejecutivas. Existe asociacion entre el perfil de personalidad CIA y el rendimiento neuropsicologico. El perfil de personalidad predice en mayor grado que el rendimiento en las pruebas neuropsicologicas el consumo de alcohol al cabo de dos anos. El mantenimiento del patron CIA implica la persistencia de diferencias de rendimiento en tareas de control atencional y velocidad de procesamiento, sensibles al funcionamiento prefrontal.",

      "title": "How can pharmacists help people with pill-swallowing difficulties? A review",
      "abstract": "Background: Solid oral dosage forms such as tablets and capsules are generally the preferred method of drug delivery. However, for many people, swallowing pills whole can be a challenge, even for those with healthy swallowing function. Aim: To review current literature on strategies facilitating pill swallowing in people who find it difficult to swallow pills. Method: The PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched using combinations of keywords pertaining to swallowing difficulties and oral medications. Results: Management of pill-swallowing difficulties should primarily focus on restoring and maintaining the ability to swallow pills whole. Postural adjustments, pill-swallowing aids, and teaching pill-swallowing techniques can help make it easier to swallow pills whole. Where these approaches are not successful or appropriate, other strategies such as alternative formulations/routes of administration or deprescribing may be considered. Ideally, modifying pills and mixing with foods and drinks, if not contraindicated, should only be used as a last resort. Overall, the evidence around the safety and efficacy of the identified strategies is limited. Discussion: People with pill-swallowing difficulties can benefit from various strategies designed to facilitate swallowing pills. However, these methods should be carefully evaluated for their efficacy and safety before being recommended to patients. Conclusion: Design of alternative medication formulations suitable to meet the needs of people with pill-swallowing difficulties can be a promising direction for the future. Until these novel delivery systems are available, administering medications to these people needs to be managed by wiser and better utilization of what is currently available.",

      "title": "Quit or Die: Nothing in between?",
      "abstract": "Accessible online at: www.karger.com/journals/res When asked about their interest in stopping smoking sometime in the future, 54% of smokers in the European Union state such an interest [1]. However, not all of these smokers actually make a serious attempt to give up and only a few percent succeed at each attempt [2]. Despite all kinds of approaches to control smoking, little is being done to decrease the prevalence of smoking in Europe. Smoking shortens the life of 50% of long-term smokers. Given this scenario, new ways to address this health problem need to be developed [3]. The need to find new approaches is even more compelling in the case where patients with severe COPD are either unable or unwilling to give up smoking with the traditional ‘abrupt-quitting’ method. For many physicians it is common to ask the patients to smoke less rather than give up smoking. This advice may be a way not to be too harsh with the patient, or even a solution for those who have failed to quit during many earlier attempts. The soft advice to smoke less almost always fails, mostly because the smoker is dependent on nicotine and therefore usually rapidly returns to the normal smoking rate. Most researchers and clinicians interested in the treatment of tobacco dependence know this. Therefore the prevailing attitude is not to give advice to smoke less or reduce smoking. The new approach suggested by Jimenez et al. [4] in this issue of Respiration is to substitute the ‘lost’ nicotine from an alternative source, e.g. from a nicotine chewing gum. Earlier studies [5, 6] have shown that nicotine replacement (NR) can aid smoking reduction in healthy subjects and also improve risk factors, e.g., cardiovascular disease [7, 8]. In the study of Jimenez et al. [4], 17 smokers with severe COPD who were unable or unwilling to stop smoking were offered to reduce their smoking with the aid of NR. Their tobacco dependence was severe, on average 9 points on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), which ranges from 0 to 10. In a representative sample of smokers, only about 2% can be expected to have a dependence 18 points on the FTND [9]. Success in giving up smoking is related to the degree of dependence. Usually no more than 5–10% of smokers so heavily dependent can be expected to give up long term. Having moderate to severe COPD is a negative prognostic factor for giving up smoking, so if anything, a lower percentage could be expected. This means that if Jimenez et al. [4] had insisted on the 17 smokers to give up completely and abruptly, 1, or 2 at most, might have been able to give up long term. This would mean a reduction of 39–78 cigarettes per day (CPD); the mean baseline smoking was 39 CPD. That outcome should be compared to the 5 patients who reduced cigarette consumption by 85%, i.e. 165 CPD in total. Such a comparison has its weaknesses, since 1 or 2 patients would not have smoked at all, and it is possible that harm reduction is not linearly related to the reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked. What is particularly intriguing with this study is that we do not just observe a reduction in cigarettes smoked, but a consistent improvement in lung function, i.e. harm reduction. Reduced smoking can result in harm reduc-",

      "abstract": "Diet counseling is an integral part of anticipatory guidance during the infant oral health visit. Similar to dietary instructions for children of all ages, the primary emphasis is on sugar intake frequency. There are, however, other infant-specific dietary issues that must also be addressed during the infant oral health visit. Breast-feeding should be promoted during the first year of life, although ad libitum nocturnal breast-feeding should be discouraged after the first primary tooth erupts. Bottle-fed infants should not be put to sleep with the bottle. Weaning from the breast or the bottle should be encouraged by 12 to 14 months of age. Infants older than 6 months and with exposure to less than 0.3 ppm fluoride in their drinking water need dietary fluoride supplements of 0.25 mg fluoride per day. Only 4 to 6 oz of fruit juice should be consumed by infants per day. Infants should not be given powdered beverages or soda pop, as these drinks pose increased risk for dental caries. Iron-fortified infant cereals, along with breast milk or infant formula, should be consumed by infants who are at least 6 months of age. Cow's milk should be completely avoided in the first year of life and restricted to less than 24 oz per day in the second year of life. Parents should be cautioned regarding the potential of various foods to constitute a choking hazard for infants.",

      "title": "The Predicted Impact of Reducing the Nicotine Content in Cigarettes on Alcohol Use",
      "abstract": "Product standards reducing the level of nicotine in cigarettes could significantly improve public health by reducing smoking behavior and toxicant exposure. However, relatively little is known about how the regulatory strategy could impact alcohol use, a closely related health behavior that is also a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. The primary objective of this paper is to predict the effect of nicotine reduction on alcohol use, identify priorities for future research, and highlight areas for mitigating any adverse outcomes. We critically reviewed and integrated literatures examining the effects of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes on smoking-related outcomes (nicotine exposure, nicotine withdrawal, and smoking as a cue to drink) and, in turn, the effects of those outcomes on alcohol use. Current evidence suggests reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes may benefit public health by reducing alcohol use and problematic drinking over time as a consequence of reduced exposure to nicotine and the smoking cues associated with drinking. Nicotine withdrawal could increase risk of drinking, although these effects should be short-lived and could be mitigated by other sources of nicotine. Gender, hazardous drinking, and psychiatric comorbidities are likely to be important moderators of the effects of VLNC cigarettes. It is imperative to broadly assess the public health impact of potential tobacco product regulations by including measures of closely related health behaviors that could be impacted by these interventions. Nicotine reduction in cigarettes may contribute to improved public health through reductions in alcohol use.",

Individuals who suppressed their thoughts consumed more and achieved a higher blood alcohol content than those who did arithmetic. The groups did not differ in mood, arousal, or frustration. Individuals higher in trait temptation to drink consumed more after suppressing their thoughts relative to those lower in trait temptation.

Zudem ist es oft schwierig, wenn nicht unmöglich, mit Sicherheit zu sagen, ob ein Arzneimittel selbst die Potenzstörung auslöst oder die Grundkrankheit, gegen die es eingesetzt wird, potenzstörend ist. Hat also ein Medikament gegen den Blutzucker Potenzstörungen verursacht oder hat der Betreffende Potenzstörungen, weil er einen Blutzucker hat? Natürlich erschwert die Tabuisierung der Sexualität bis heute, das genau zu erforschen. Kaum ein Patient gibt solche neu auftretenden Probleme spontan an.",

      "abstract": "Eleven obese women progressively increased periods of walking each day for one year or longer while no dietary restriction was imposed. No weight loss occurred until walking exceeded 30 minutes daily. Generally, weight loss paralleled length of time spent walking. When a certain amount of walking was maintained and weight stabilized at a lower level, more weight loss occurred when walking was increased. Weight loss was slow and proceeded at a rate much less than anticipated if no compensatory increase in food intake had occurred. A marked decrease in skinfold thickness over the upper part of the arm occurred, suggesting that loss of fat accounted for most, if not all, of the weight loss.",

Alcohol consumption of three or more drinks per day and cigarette smoking share similar, and probably additive, effects on some forms of cardiovascular disease. There is relatively little evidence, however, that the effets are worse when smoking and drinking occur together than would be expected from their independent effects. In most cases, moderate drinking does not share these risks and even has opposite effects of cigarette smoking on some risk factors. Ongoing public health efforts to minimize tobacco use and harmful drinking should result in clear and important gains to the nation's cardiovascular well-being.",

      "title": "Help your patients with smoking cessation",
      "abstract": "Figure: Q: Why talk to my patients about smoking cessation when they already know smoking is an unhealthy practice?A: Most patients who smoke know that doing so is bad for their health. They've heard it countless times, but still they continue to smoke. The act of smoking isn't just a bad habit; it's a physiologic and psychological addiction. Nicotine dependence should be viewed as a chronic disease, with multiple possible comorbidities. The majority of patients who smoke cycle through multiple periods of relapse and remission, so smoking cessation counseling is needed for ongoing support of those who are trying to quit and also for those who've already quit. The single most important health decision a patient who smokes can make is to quit. Although 70% of those who smoke want to quit, only 3% are successful without smoking cessation intervention. Nurses are in a prime position to begin the process of motivating their patients to consider quitting during their admission assessment. At this beginning stage, two questions are critical: \"Do you smoke?\" and \"Do you want to quit?\" Although you may not be able to spend much time in cessation counseling with your patient, the mere suggestion of quitting may be enough to move him to action in the near future. In a nonjudgmental way you can provide resources for your patient to take home to use when he's ready to quit, even if he isn't ready to do so upon discharge. In addition to office-based or off-site counseling and community-based cessation classes, you may refer your patient to quit lines and print and Internet-based educational materials. You may also inform him about the option of pharmacotherapy to aid him in quitting. There are several free smoking cessation programs available online, such as those offered by the American Lung Association (http://www.lungusa.org/stop-smoking), the National Alliance for Tobacco Cessation (http://becomeanex.org), and Smokefree.gov. It's been shown that even a brief tobacco intervention is an effective motivator for the patient to begin thinking about quitting. For a patient who shows a willingness to quit, consider the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 5 A's model for treating tobacco use and dependence (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange follow-up). For a patient who shows an unwillingness to quit, consider the 5 R's model: Relevance: Encourage the patient to indicate why quitting is personally relevant. Risks: Identify potential negative consequences of tobacco use (acute, long-term, and environmental risks). Rewards: Identify potential benefits of stopping tobacco use, such as improved health, saving money, and better food taste. Roadblocks: Have the patient identify barriers to quitting and help him problem solve. Repetition: Repeat these steps at every visit. Who better to begin smoking cessation counseling than you as you care for your patients every day?",

Estos dispositivos calientan una solución líquida con sabores, nicotina o tetrahidrocanabinol para crear un aerosol, que se inhala; esto ha generado gran interés entre adolescentes desde edades muy tempranas, con aumento en la incidencia del consumo y desconocimiento de sus efectos, por campañas publicitarias que muestran los CE como inocuos. Los CE generan compromiso pulmonar, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurológico, tegumentario, entre otros; con diferentes grados de afección desde leves hasta la muerte. La enfermedad pulmonar asociada al CE o productos del vapeo (EVALI, por sus siglas en inglés) se empezó a reportar desde el año 2017, y el aumento de casos de EVALI en Estados Unidos generó la emisión de numerosos avisos. Desde salud pública se han generado restricciones en algunos países sobre la venta de ciertos tipos de productos de CE o vapeo, sin lograr controlar el consumo entre los adolescentes. Para el pediatra o el médico de atención primaria es indispensable conocer las implicaciones de vapeo, para realizar acciones de prevención y tratamiento oportunos.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cocaine addiction is a significant problem in the United States and treatment is hampered by high relapse rates. This is particularly the case with crack cocaine because it is smoked and consequently has a rapid but relatively short‐lived effect on the brain. This readily creates a cycle of craving and dependence. Moreover, the multiple environmental cues associated with the craving set up powerful conditions for relapse. This paper describes an Ericksonian approach alongside more traditional hypnotic techniques. In particular, the methods of utilization and orientation to the future are described and a one‐year follow‐up is discussed. Copyright © 1999 British Society of Experimental and Clinical Hypnosis",

      "title": "Common dietary supplements for weight loss.",
      "abstract": "Over-the-counter dietary supplements to treat obesity appeal to many patients who desire a \"magic bullet\" for weight loss. Asking overweight patients about their use of weight-loss supplements and understanding the evidence for the efficacy, safety, and quality of these supplements are critical when counseling patients regarding weight loss. A schema for whether physicians should recommend, caution, or discourage use of a particular weight-loss supplement is presented in this article. More than 50 individual dietary supplements and more than 125 commercial combination products are available for weight loss. Currently, no weight-loss supplements meet criteria for recommended use. Although evidence of modest weight loss secondary to ephedra-caffeine ingestion exists, potentially serious adverse effects have led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban the sale of these products. Chromium is a popular weight-loss supplement, but its efficacy and long-term safety are uncertain. Guar gum and chitosan appear to be ineffective; therefore, use of these products should be discouraged. Because of insufficient or conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of conjugated linoleic acid, ginseng, glucomannan, green tea, hydroxycitric acid, L-carnitine, psyllium, pyruvate, and St. John's wort in weight loss, physicians should caution patients about the use of these supplements and closely monitor those who choose to use these products.",

Dieser Artikel gibt einen Überblick zur Relevanz von Fremdstoffen und Krankheitserregern in der Muttermilch für das gestillte Kind. Betrachtet werden Medikamente, Rauchen, Alkohol- bzw. Kaffeekonsum, persistente Umweltkontaminanten und Rückstände sowie Infektionen. Bei angezeigter Arzneimitteltherapie lassen sich für die meisten Erkrankungen Medikamente finden, die keine längeren Stillpausen oder sogar Abstillen erfordern. Bei einer Langzeitbehandlung, insbesondere unter Kombinationstherapie, muss dies jedoch im Einzelfall geprüft werden. Auf Rauchen und den Konsum von Alkohol sollte in der Stillzeit verzichtet werden, während der Verzehr von bis zu zwei Tassen Kaffee täglich unproblematisch ist. Die gegenwärtigen Gehalte der in Deutschland relevanten Umweltkontaminanten und Rückstände in der Muttermilch sind als unbedenklich anzusehen; hier ist bemerkenswert, dass sich die vor mehr als 20 Jahren als kritisch betrachtete Dioxinbelastung bis heute um den Faktor 10 hat reduzieren lassen. Eine mütterliche Infektion mit dem Human Immunodeficiency-Virus (HIV) stellt in Ländern mit ausreichendem Hygienestandard eine der wenigen medizinischen Indikationen zum Abstillen dar. Insgesamt sind die Risiken durch Fremdstoffe und Krankheitserreger in der Muttermilch beim ausschließlich gestillten Säugling in der Regel gering und stellen somit üblicherweise keinen Grund für längere Stillpausen oder ein Abstillen dar. Nur in wenigen Einzelfällen (bestimmte Medikamente, HIV-Infektion) ist ein Abstillen im Interesse der Gesundheit des Kindes zu empfehlen.",

The inconsistent and often contradictory results within any subject in coffee/caffeine and health research leads to further confusion, while the stimulatory effects of caffeine are subject to considerable inter‐individual variation, affecting personal attitudes (whether positive or negative) towards caffeinated beverages. Assessing individual research studies on their own merit, and putting into perspective the overall data on a number of health topics, from cardiovascular disease to cancer, does suggest that the health risks of moderate coffee or caffeine consumption are not as great as may have been assumed. Individuals should perhaps not be concerned about the effects of drinking coffee on their physical wellbeing.",

Alcohol is having varying impact on health of people. Short-term effects include motor vehicle accidents, violence, injuries, and risky sexual behavior while long-term effects include carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, gastric ulcer, pancreatitis etc (2). Alcohol consumption is a major Public health Challenge. In India 18.8% males and 1.3% females above age of 15 years were consuming alcohol according to NFHS-5 Survey (3). In India different states are having different age limits for alcohol purchase and consumption. Although legal age for alcohol consumption in India varies from 18-25 years of age. States like Gujarat, Bihar, Nagaland and union territory of Lakshadweep and Manipur has complete ban on sale &amp; purchase of same (4). Although some rules and regulations are there but still many people who are below this age limit they consume it. Alcohol is also one of the habit-forming substances so when control is not there people land up in chronic alcoholism. Reasons for increase in consumption of alcohol is rapid industrialization, nuclear family, staying away from warm family environment, peer pressure, pressure of job and performing well in life, i.e. target setting is there, increase social gatherings and alcohol consumption is considered as symbol of modernization.",

      "title": "Hábitos masticatorios como factores de riesgo de la enfermedad periodontal en una población del Sur de la India",
      "abstract": "La enfermedad periodontal es de origen multifactorial. La infeccion siempre esta presente en la patologia, pero muchos factores pueden influir tanto en su inicio como en su progresion. Estos incluyen factores microbiologicos, geneticos, inmunologicos, ambientales y conductuales. Este ultimo representa un riesgo cuando las costumbres socioculturales incluyen eventos que pueden modificar la salud periodontal. La masticacion de betel y tabaco en la India son actividades culturales y populares importantes. Los productos de Betel son la cuarta sustancia psicoactiva mas comun en el mundo, despues de la cafeina, el alcohol y la nicotina. Este habito produce modificaciones significativas de la superficie dental, generando desgastes y manchas. Varios estudios han demostrado que los habitos socioculturales de masticar betel quid con o sin tabaco y tabaco en diferentes presentaciones tienen un efecto modificador en la enfermedad periodontal. Sin embargo, existe poca informacion disponible que compare el efecto del uso habitual de diferentes productos masticables sobre la salud periodontal en una poblacion caracterizada por estos habitos socioculturales. El objetivo de este estudio es evaluar comparativamente la salud periodontal en pacientes que habitualmente mastican diferentes productos y pacientes que no tienen estos habitos en la comunidad rural de Anantapur, en el estado de Andhra Pradesh, India. Objetivo: evaluar de forma comparada el estado periodontal en pacientes que mastican rutinariamente diferentes productos y pacientes que no tienen este habito. Metodos: se realizo un estudio transversal. Se consideraron los pacientes incluidos en las operaciones de atencion dental social promovidas y llevadas a cabo por la Fundacion Vicente Ferrer en la comunidad rural de Anantapur, estado de Andhra Pradesh, India. El examen oral registro los siguientes aspectos: Higiene oral por el Indice de Higiene Oral Simplificada (OHI-S) y el Indice Periodontal Comunitario (IPC) para el estado periodontal. Ademas, se aplico una encuesta validada que incluia aspectos relacionados con el habito de masticacion. Resultados: Un total de 1023 pacientes cumplieron con todos los criterios de inclusion / exclusion. Los pacientes fueron divididos en 3 grupos etarios de 20-34 , 35-44 y de 45-65 anos. El 57.9% (n = 593) de los pacientes indicaron que no tenian el habito de masticar sustancias. De los pacientes masticadores habituales (n = 430), el 17,2% masticaron productos de betel quid (BQ), 16% de betel quid mas tabaco (BQ + Tb) y 8,9% de preparaciones de tabaco (Tb). Los pacientes con habito de masticacion se asociaron significativamente con valores de IPC peores. El IPC entre los masticadores BQ, BQ + Tb y Tb no mostro diferencias significativas. El 91.3% (n = 934) de los pacientes que presentaron un OHI-S considerado deficiente-malo, y un 84.85% (n = 868) indicaron higiene bucal una vez al dia. Estos grupos se relacionaron significativamente con peores valores de IPC. Los sextantes 1, 3, 4 y 6 de los pacientes masticadores mostraron un predominio de valores de IPC peores. El odds ratio mostro un mayor efecto de habito de masticacion en el sextante cuatro y seis. El analisis del efecto de los productos de masticacion mostro una asociacion de valores de IPC peores en el segundo y quinto sexto con los productos BQ + Tb. Conclusiones: en la poblacion estudiada, el habito de masticacion se asocio con una mayor prevalencia de valores de IPC peores. Esta asociacion no se modifico por genero, rango de edad o el estado de higiene y fue independiente de los productos de masticacion identificados en este estudio. Si bien las diferencias en los valores de IPC se encontraron entre los sextantes, tanto para los masticadores como para los no masticadores, el habito de masticacion parecio tener un mayor efecto local en los sextantes cuatro y seis.",

      "abstract": "Scientists struggle to conceal the bitterness of medications. Many oral medicines and bulking agents are bitter. Bitterness masking is vital for patient compliance. Many formulations with increased performance and acceptance have been developed to improve palatability. The disagreeable taste of formulation has been disguised by sensory, barrier, chemical, and complexity methods. Taste is acknowledged as a crucial component in patient compliance, especially in youngsters, where acceptability and hence ease of administration may be considerably altered. The methods used to hide the taste of medications are detailed in this review. Taste is a key factor in oral product adoption. Many oral medications, foods, and bulking agents have unpleasant bitter flavours. Oral administration of bitter medications is a major concern for health care practitioners, particularly for juvenile patients. Masking a drug’s disagreeable taste increases patient compliance and thereby profits. Various known procedures have been used to remove or reduce the bitterness of these medications, but no generally applicable methodology has been identified.",

      "abstract": "It is well established that regular exercise plays an important role in achieving a number of health and wellbeing outcomes. However, certain post-exercise behaviors, including the consumption of unhealthy high-calorie foods, can counteract some of the benefits of physical activity. There are at least three overlapping pathways through which exercise may increase the likelihood of consuming pleasurable but unhealthy foods: through impulsive cognitive processes, reflective cognitive processes, and/or physiological responses. It is argued in this paper that motivation toward exercise can influence each of these pathways. Drawing from literature from various domains, we postulate that controlled exercise motivation, as opposed to autonomous exercise motivation, is more likely to influence each of these pathways in a manner that leaves individuals susceptible to the post-exercise consumption of pleasurable but unhealthy foods.",

Widespread drunkenness during the early 1990s facilitated privatization of economy: workers and some intelligentsia did not oppose privatizations because of drunkenness and involvement in illegal activities. Apparently, alcohol consumption and heavy binge drinking have been decreasing in Russia since approximately the last decade. Exaggeration of alcohol-related problems tends to veil shortages of the health care system. There are motives to exaggerate consumption of nonbeverage alcohol in order to veil the problem of toxicity of some legally sold beverages. It is essential to distinguish between legally and illegally sold rather than between recorded and unrecorded alcohol because sales of poor-quality alcoholic beverages in legally operating shops and kiosks occurred generally with knowledge of authorities.",

      "title": "Self-medication Practices Among Muslim Youth of Kashmir: An Empirical Study",
      "abstract": "In many parts of the world self-medication is a popular practice to treat some common minor diseases in order to save time and money without realizing side effects of self-medication for the patients. We know ‘Over The Counter’ (OTC) drugs are meant for self-medications but their wrong use due to lack of knowledge about medicines can have grave side-effects on patients. In Kashmir the growth in self-medications in Kashmir can be attributed to urge to self-care, feeling of sympathy towards ill family members, deficiency of health services, economic condition, unawareness and easy availability of drugs in medical shops. To treat minor common diseases like fever, cold, cough, diarrhoea etc patients acquire expert advices from family members, neighbours or strangers about medications. Majority of people do not take their illness seriously or avoid Doctor because of busy life, ignoring side effects of self-medication. In Kashmir, it is a common practice in homes to use antibiotics like Co-Amoxyclav 625 and Azithromycin for treating common cold and sharing of prescriptions within the family, using the left over medications for somewhat related symptoms is quite a popular practice. In the present study carried out in Kashmir valley, a survey of the study area was carried out and discussions were held with the elders as well as with medical practitioners. A well-designed validated questionnaire was used to collect the information from 400 youth selected at random from Kashmir on their consent. The data collected from survey was statistically analysed using standard statistical methods. The study revealed that majority of respondents were taking medicine without consulting a Doctor to treat minor ailments. Statistically, it was observed that there was a significant difference in the attitude of male and female respondents towards self medication (P&lt;0.01). The discussion with respondents revealed that they were interested in knowing Islamic ruling about self-medication as in the present world due to lack of patience youth take medicine because of depression and anxiety. Islam allows modern treatment of many diseases like infertility provided it is not against the teaching of Islam and guidance of holy Prophet. Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) taught Muslims to pray more in tough times for attaining peace of mind, relief from pain, anxiety and worries. Finally, it was suggested that everyone should avoid self-medication as much as possible and Government should play its role to avoid the selling of banned medicines on medical shops without Doctors prescription",

Others argue for classifying smoking as either simply a lifestyle choice or, at worst, a lack of consistent commitment to quit.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that motivating a smoker to stop consuming tobacco is a key piece of primary prevention, by preventing cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancies, to name just a few. However, classifying smoking as an addictive disease has far-reaching and practical implications for treatment: abstinence needs to be promoted and stabilized with the help of medically supported psychotherapeutic interventions as well as simple motivational measures.

      "title": "Roentgenologic Examination of the Digestive Tracts of Infants and Children",
      "abstract": "IN a very young infant, or an unruly older child, it may be necessary to administer the opaque meal through a catheter or stomach tube. In order to facilitate this procedure, as the mixture is usually too thick to flow quickly through a tube attached to a funnel, the meal may be introduced through a syringe attached to the end of the stomach tube. Infants able to nurse from a bottle may have the opaque meal given in this way, using the ordinary feeding formula, and adding to it one part of barium sulphate to about eight parts of food. The quantity of food administered is about that of an average feeding for the age of the child. In children over two years of age, a mixed feeding may be given, such as a cup of cocoa and a dish of cereal to which has been added one part of barium sulphate to eight parts of the substances used. Some children can be tempted to take the barium in ice cream. Occasionally, an older child will take the ordinary barium sulphate cream used in the examination of adults. Whatever food is given, it is advisable to observe fluoroscopically at least a part of it as it passes through the esophagus, in order not to overlook a lesion in this region, such as stricture or cardiospasm. The filled stomach is studied fluoroscopically for evidence of pylorospasm and for the character of the peristaltic waves. The stomach is usually palpated in an endeavor to fill the duodenum. However, this organ rarely shows the typical caplike appearance in very young children. A colon injection is then given, using the same kind of opaque mixture that is used for adults, but in quantity proportionate to the size and age of the child. In a case of megacolon, which may have been disclosed in the course of the opaque meal examination, an unusually large amount of injection may be required. This may be determined by watching through the horizontal fluoroscope the injection flow into the bowel. Stereoscopic roentgenograms are made in the prone position, followed by single or stereoscopic exposures in the vertical position. In unusual cases, these may be supplemented by oblique or lateral exposures. The child is then allowed to eliminate the infection. The amount of retention in the colon and the condition of the ileocecal valve are noted in exposures immediately after the elimination. In cases of dilatation of the cecum, the emptying of the sigmoid will allow the cecum to be observed much more clearly and remove all doubt of the shadow produced by an elongated sigmoid passing far to the right and overlapping the cecum. Special study of the appendix may be made at 24-hour intervals, until it is empty. Among congenital anomalies of the esophagus, one of the most important is the type of atresia in which the lower end communicates with the respiratory tract, while the upper end terminates in a blind pouch.",

That claim is increasingly in vogue, often supported by data showing the high likelihood of progression to daily tobacco use following experimentation and the high percentage of cigarette smokers, compared with cocaine users who appear addicted. In the context of criteria for addiction or dependence presented by the World Health Organization, the American Psychiatric Association, and the US Surgeon General, we consider several lines of evidence, including patterns of use, mortality, physical dependence potential, and pharmacologic addiction liability measures. Within each line of evidence, we compare nicotine with cocaine. We conclude that on the current evidence nicotine cannot be considered more addicting than cocaine. Both are highly addicting drugs for which patterns of use and the development of dependence are strongly influenced by factors such as availability, price, social pressures, and regulations, as well as certain pharmacologic characteristics.",

      "title": "10 Helpful Steps for Breaking a Bad Habit",
      "abstract": "REALITY CHECK. Every person has habits — acquired behaviors or thought processes that are repeated so frequently and automatically that they figuratively become hardwired into the brain of the individual. Some of these habits are good, whereas others are not so good. To break a bad habit that may be affecting their health negatively (e.g., unhealthy snacking, excessive drinking, etc.), individuals need to be aware of the behavior they would like to stop. Once that particular conduct is determined, they can develop and implement a strategy for changing those actions that may be compromising their health, for example. ALL IN. Above all, breaking a bad habit requires a resolute commitment to change. As such, individuals who are not committed fully to altering their life in a way that enables them to overcome their negative behavior(s) are doomed to fail. Breaking a bad habit mandates a rigorous investment of time, energy, and perseverance — elements that go hand in hand with a person's buy-in to the requisite change. ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. In reality, no single viable way exists to break bad habits. An approach that may be effective for one person may not work for another. The key for individuals is to identify their bad habit(s) and then to address, to the degree possible, those factors that are contributing to their behavior. In that regard, it can be very helpful to identify cues or triggers that lead to the undesirable habit and then eliminate as many of those elements as possible. TARGETED PLAN. Once individuals understand their situation, they should develop a plan that entails detailed goals for changing their behavior and strategies for minimizing the triggers for their habit(s). In general, they should focus on achieving relatively smaller steps initially and then expanding their goals going forward. The underlying concept is to avoid establishing a solution to changing their behavior that may seem unduly daunting to them. CHANGE THE SCENERY. Research indicates that, to a degree, breaking a bad habit entails that individuals reduce their situational triggers until they can identify and implement new ways of dealing with them. In other words, one of the most effective steps for changing behavior is to avoid the people and the places with whom and in which the bad habit(s) occurred. As such, if an individual's set of circumstances cues a person to engage in unwanted behaviors, it is time to change that individual's environment. CONSTRUCTIVE THINKING. Individuals who want to break a bad habit should focus on acquiring a new alternative behavior, as opposed to setting a negative goal of not doing something. All factors considered, an individual's internal system for learning habits does not really learn anything by not doing. The basic goal, in this instance, should be to create and ingrain new positive behavior-related habits. Arguably, one of the easiest ways to break a bad habit is to replace it with a new one (e.g., instead of consuming a bowl of ice cream in the evening, eat a bowl of strawberries). CELEBRATE SUCCESS. Individuals should reward themselves for any positive accomplishments they achieve, big or small, with regard to their efforts to break a bad habit. Although heartfelt praise, whether from others or themselves, often is a very powerful payback for undertaking a desired behavioral change, a material reward also can be appropriate, as well as quite motivating. MENTAL MATTERS. One step that can help individuals break their bad habits is to imagine scenarios in which they engage in the desired behavior — as opposed to the bad habit. Such visualization can reinforce their positive actions. Another mind-related step that can affect a person's ability to break a bad habit is mental preparation and practice, which can help individuals decide, in advance, how they will handle tempting situations, should they arise. RIDE IT OUT. Individuals should always remember that they are human. As such, they occasionally may slip back into an old habit (or two) now and then. When that situation occurs, they should not beat themselves up (i.e., “if they slip up, they should not give up!”). In reality, success is not an absolute end point. The overriding goal is to change the unwanted behavior. If they get off track (for whatever reason), they need to return as soon as possible to whatever has worked for them. Being harsh on themselves is not helpful. NO RUSH. Research indicates that as much as 40% of a person's actions are habits, as opposed to conscious decisions. On occasion, some of those habits have a negative impact on a person's life. Breaking one of those habits can take time, however, regardless of how obvious the need for behavioral change is or how much an individual may want to alter what they do. More often than not, the process of such change is arguably long, ranging (according to recent studies) from as few as 18 days to more than 8 months. In this situation, patience is more than a virtue — it is paramount.",

Our lifestyle can play a significant role in this. The aim of this review is to enhance public awareness of longevity and to emphasise the consequences of our daily habits.Materials and Methods. A literature review was carried out using the PubMed database, searching for the most recently published scientific sources.State of Knowledge. The review details the impact of individual lifestyle elements on quantity and quality of life. The benefits of physical activity were discussed, including the amount of exercise necessary per week to reduce mortality risk, and the most efficacious sport disciplines for health promotion. It also emphasises the significance of dietary habits and the role of phytochemicals. Additionally, it addresses the following questions: Does consuming small amounts of alcohol prolong life? What is the extent of the damage caused by smoking? How can stress and sleep be managed? Why are social relationships an important protective element? Finally, it considers whether there is a cure for longevity.Summary. A holistic approach that encompasses a sufficient level of physical activity, proper nutritional habits and the maintenance of a healthy body weight can contribute towards the attainment of longevity. Conversely, factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, poor stress or sleep management and loneliness can have a negative effect on life expectancy. A search is underway for anti-aging pharmacological compounds that are both efficacious and safe.",

      "title": "Cannabis Use and Performance in Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Cannabis is a widely used illicit drug among adolescents, many of whom perceive little risk from cannabis. Cannabis use is associated with poor academic performance and increased school drop-outs. It is also associated with high-risk behaviors in adolescents like crime, violence, unprotected sexual encounters, and car accidents. Many of these adolescents have conduct, disorders, ADHD and learning disorders. There is some evidence to suggest that cannabis use leads to use of harder drugs. It is well documented that it produces acute cognitive effects that last for several hours after its ingestion. However, it is debatable whether it produces cognitive dysfunction beyond the period of acute intoxication. Language: en",

      "title": "The Impact of Smokeless Tobacco, Nicotine Pouches, and Electronic Cigarettes on Oral Health. Summary of the Doctoral Thesis",
      "abstract": "\"In recent years, new tobacco and nicotine-containing products have emerged that offer colourful designs and a variety of flavours. These products are becoming increasingly popular, not only with traditional tobacco users, but also with new smokers. One of these new nicotine products are nicotine pouches, which resemble smokeless tobacco in appearance and use. Although the sale of smokeless tobacco is prohibited in Latvia, it is widely used, especially among athletes. Nicotine pouches, or smokeless tobacco sachets, are placed under the upper or lower lip and allow the absorption of tobacco, nicotine and other substances through the oral mucosa. As these products do not produce smoke, they are easy to use without disturbing others. Meanwhile, electronic cigarettes are attracting not only current tobacco users, ostensibly to help them to quit smoking, but also individuals who have never used tobacco products before. Unfortunately, disposable electronic cigarettes are widely used by children, leading not only to serious addiction problems but also to health problems requiring hospitalisation. At present, the public and the authorities are under the impression, largely created by these manufacturers, that these new tobacco and nicotine products are a much better alternative to cigarettes and therefore their sale should not be banned. Moreover, such claims are supported by research funded by or associated with these manufacturers. As these products have only recently entered the market, studies on their effects on oral and general health are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of smokeless tobacco products, nicotine pouches and electronic smoking devices on oral microbiota, salivary inflammatory biomarkers and overall oral health. Five scientific articles have been published based on the results of the research and the Thesis will be defended as a series of publications. The research design includes four sections. The first section includes a survey of respondents about general health, oral health habits, diet, lifestyle and use of tobacco and nicotine products. Respondents were selected based on inclusion criteria, followed by oral examinations and the collection of saliva and biofilm samples. The second section includes a histopathological and visual examination of clinical changes in the oral cavity. In the third section, inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) and LRG-1 in saliva samples are examined. In the fourth section periodontal pathogens and other microorganisms (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Rothia mucilaginosa) in saliva, subgingival and supragingival biofilm samples are investigated. The results show that users of smokeless tobacco and nicotine pouches report dry mouth and tingling of the mucous membranes. Users of electronic cigarettes and pouches are prone to bleeding gums, increased plaque build-up, gum recession, altered taste and bad breath. In addition, in areas where pouches are placed, mucosal changes can be seen, clinically characterised as white keratoses of varying roughness and shape. Histological examination of these mucosal samples shows parakeratosis with marked acanthotic mucosal thickening, intraepithelial and connective tissue oedema and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes and macrophages. Such changes can be defined as mild dysplasia, which is a precancerous condition. In addition, smokeless tobacco and nicotine pouch users who were clinically diagnosed with oral mucosal changes had elevated levels of IL-6 in saliva. Periodontal pathogenic microorganisms are found in the saliva and periodontal pockets of users of electronic cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and nicotine pouches, suggesting that the use of these products may lead to periodontitis. The study data suggest that these products negatively impact oral health and are a serious risk factor for the development of periodontitis and mucosal disease. Furthermore, as these products have only recently entered the market, the long-term effects on oral health are not yet known. The Doctoral Thesis was developed at Rīga Stradiņš University, Department of Biology and microbiology.

      "title": "Shifting pharmacology of nicotine use and withdrawal: Breaking the cycle of drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death, responsible for over 400,000 premature deaths every year in the United States and weighing heavily on an economy with a nearly $200 billion combined cost of health care and lost productivity (1). Despite the deleterious immediate and long-term effects of smoking, only 3% of smokers successfully quit, although 70% of all smokers express the desire to do so (2). Nicotine is the main addictive psychoactive ingredient present in tobacco smoke (3). Chronic exposure to nicotine initiates neuroadaptation; these alterations, in turn, promote continued tobacco use. When a smoker attempts cessation, this new equilibrium maintained by nicotine exposure is disrupted, leading to the withdrawal state. Withdrawal is a series of affective and somatic symptoms that emerge a few hours after nicotine abstinence, reflecting neurochemical imbalance (4); however, the precise nature of this imbalance has remained elusive. Nicotine, as is the case with many other drugs of abuse, is known to have an impact on the dopamine (DA) system (5). Grieder et al. (6) perform a series of elegant experiments using pharmacology and electrophysiology in parallel with genetic and behavioral approaches to examine how the dopaminergic system may be involved in this process. An important aspect of their work is that it highlights the double dissociation of dopaminergic system involvement between acute exposure to nicotine and the chronic withdrawn state with respect to DA neuron activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the DA receptors that mediate conditioned place aversion (Fig. 1).",

      "abstract": "La non-adherence medicamenteuse designe les situations ou le patient ne suit pas les directives des autorites medicales concernant la prise d'un medicament. Il peut s'agir d'une situation ou le patient prend trop (sur-usage) ou pas assez (sous-usage) de medicaments, boit de l'alcool alors qu'il y a une contrindication, ou encore commet une tentative de suicide a l'aide de medicaments. Selon [HAYNES 2002] ameliorer l'adherence pourrait avoir un plus grand impact sur la sante de la population que tout autre amelioration d'un traitement medical specifique. Cependant les donnees sur la non-adherence sont difficiles a acquerir, puisque les patients en situation de non-adherence sont peu susceptibles de rapporter leurs actions a leurs medecins. Nous proposons d'exploiter les donnees des reseaux sociaux pour etudier la non-adherence medicamenteuse.Dans un premier temps, nous collectons un corpus de messages postes sur des forums medicaux. Nous construisons des vocabulaires de noms de medicaments et de maladies utilises par les patients. Nous utilisons ces vocabulaires pour indexer les medicaments et maladies dans les messages. Ensuite nous utilisons des methodes d'apprentissage supervise et de recherche d'information pour detecter les messages de forum parlant d'une situation de non-adherence. Avec les methodes d'apprentissage supervise, nous obtenons 0,433 de F-mesure, avec un maximum de 0,421 de precision ou 0,610 de rappel. Avec les methodes de recherche d'information, nous atteignons une precision de 0,8 sur les dix premiers resultats. Nous etudions ensuite le contenu des messages ainsi decouverts pour connaitre les differents types de non-adherence et savoir comment et pourquoi les patients se retrouvent dans de telles situations. Nous identifions 3 motivations : gerer soi-meme sa sante, rechercher un effet different de celui pour lequel le medicament est prescrit, etre en situation d'addiction ou d'accoutumance. La gestion de sa sante recouvre ainsi plusieurs situations : eviter un effet secondaire, moduler l'effet du medicament, sous-utiliser un medicament percu comme inutile, agir sans avis medical. Additionnellement, une non-adherence peut survenir par erreur ou negligence, sans motivation particuliere. A l'issue de notre etude nous produisons : un corpus annote avec des messages de non-adherence, un classifieur capable de detecter les messages de non-adherence, une typologie des situations de non-adherence et une analyse des causes de la non-adherence.",

The person who is in generally good health and has no looming danger, may not be particularly motivated to do anything differently. If, on the other hand, there is possible danger in the future—for a smoker or for someone living through a pandemic—there are actions that should be taken now. In this case, optimism may not be beneficial. Overwhelming numbers of smokers who start young thinking they can quit come to regret their decision to start smoking. In this case, defensive pessimism, while relatively unpleasant in the moment, may lead to more effective action and better outcomes in the future. Once the status quo has been lost and the goal is recovery from illness or injury and in the hope of regaining one’s prior healthy status, optimism, even unrealistic optimism, maintains motivation and leads to positive outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine, nicotine, ethanol and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are among the most prevalent and culturally accepted drugs in western society. For example, in Europe and North America up to 90% of the adult population drinks coffee daily and, although less prevalent, the other drugs are also used extensively by the population. Smoked tobacco, excessive alcohol consumption and marijuana (cannabis) smoking are addictive and exhibit adverse health effects. These drugs are not only common in the general population, but have also made their way into elite sports because of their purported performance-altering potential. Only one of the drugs (i.e., caffeine) has enough scientific evidence indicating an ergogenic effect. There is some preliminary evidence for nicotine as an ergogenic aid, but further study is required; cannabis and alcohol can exhibit ergogenic potential under specific circumstances but are in general believed to be ergolytic for sports performance. These drugs are currently (THC, ethanol) or have been (caffeine) on the prohibited list of the World Anti-Doping Agency or are being monitored (nicotine) due to their potential ergogenic or ergolytic effects. The aim of this brief review is to evaluate the effects of caffeine, nicotine, ethanol and THC by: 1) examining evidence supporting the ergogenic or ergolytic effects; 2) providing an overview of the mechanism(s) of action and physiological effects; and 3) where appropriate, reviewing their impact as performance-altering aids used in recreational and elite sports.",

As possiveis abordagens para reduzir a exposicao a toxinas do fumo incluem a reducao da quantidade de tabaco usada e o uso de produtos menos toxicos, como produtos farmaceuticos, nicotina e potenciais produtos de tabaco de exposicao reduzida (PREPs), como uma alternativa aos cigarros. A proibicao de fumar foi implementada em uma variedade de configuracoes, alem de fazer parte da politica em muitas jurisdicoes para proteger o publico e os funcionarios dos efeitos nocivos do fumo passivo (SHS). O tabagismo em adultos geralmente tem suas raizes na adolescencia. Se os individuos nao fumam durante esse periodo, e improvavel que eles o facam. Alem disso, uma vez estabelecido o tabagismo, a cessacao e um desafio; a probabilidade de desistencia subsequente e inversamente proporcional a idade de iniciacao, uma nova abordagem para reduzir a prevalencia de jovens fumantes e o uso de incentivos, as politicas de tabaco escolar (STPs) podem revelar-se uma estrategia promissora para impedir o inicio do tabagismo entre os adolescentes, pois ha evidencias de que o ambiente escolar pode influenciar os jovens a fumar, a  terapia de reposicao de nicotina (TRN) tambem se mostra uma grande estrategia para substituir temporariamente grande parte da nicotina dos cigarros para reduzir a motivacao para os sintomas de abstinencia de fumo e de nicotina, facilitando assim a transicao do tabagismo para a abstinencia completa. Objetivo: Apresentar possibilidades de prevencoes eficazes que possibilitam uma diminuicao no consumo do tabaco, visando uma melhora na saude publica. Metodologia : Trata-se de uma revisao de literatura pesquisa produzida no Portal de Pesquisa da BVS de Enfermagem empregando artigos produzidos no periodo de 2010 a 2016, utilizando as seguintes bases de dados MEDLINE, LILACS E BDENF. Resultados/Discussoes: Todas as formas comercialmente disponiveis de NRT (goma, adesivo transdermico, spray nasal, inalador e comprimidos / pastilhas sublinguais) podem ajudar as pessoas que fazem uma tentativa de parar de aumentar suas chances de parar de fumar com sucesso.  Conclusao: As prevencoes, como palestras, incentivos por ligacoes, suporte de apoio que a saude publica oferece, tratamentos medicamentosos substitutivas de nicotinas, podem conjuntamente mudar o cenario de aumento dos usuarios de tabaco.

From the political and social aspects of the stand I have taken regarding official reaction to the use and possession of marihuana, most of the studies that have been conducted generally seem to indicate little adverse effect as the result of the moderate use of marihuana. It is not addictive, nor does it cause the aggressive behavior alcohol does. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the use of marihuana need necessarily lead to the use of LSD or any of the hard drugs.

      "abstract": "Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviors (UWCBs) include using diet pills, purging (vomiting or using laxatives) and fasting for 24 hours or more to lose weight. UWCBs are prevalent among teenagers, can have potentially dangerous health consequences and are precursors to eating disorders. Yet UWCBs have been largely overlooked in economics and there are few if any government or public health interventions to address such behaviors on a broader scale. Past economic research indicates that weight-conscious adolescents also use smoking as a strategy to control their weight - teenagers' demand for cigarettes may be in part derived from their demand for weight loss. In addition, research in epidemiology and public health finds that teenagers who engage in UWCBs are much more likely to smoke. This suggests that anti-tobacco policies such as cigarette taxes targeted to combat youth smoking are a possible policy lever for understanding UWCBs. If teens use cigarette smoking to lose weight, instead of or in combination with UWCBs, or if reduced smoking leads to unintentional weight gain among teens, higher taxes could have spillover effects to UWCBs. Using repeated cross-section, individual-level data from the 1999-2013 National and State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys combined with state-level policies and characteristics, this research provides evidence on the association between smoking, body image concerns and the use of UWCBs in teenagers. Results suggest that cigarette taxes reduce smoking, including for those trying to lose/maintain weight and especially among girls. Cigarette taxes increase the incidence of UWCBs, again among girls. Specifically, my main results indicate that a $1 increase in cigarette taxes leads to a 1.2 percentage point increase in UWCB participation among teenage girls, a meaningful increase relative to the overall sample prevalence of 22.3%.",

It is likely that humans have stuck to any brew containing compounds with psychoactive properties, resulting in a better daily life, i.e., more efficient thinking, exploring, hunting, etc., however, without the serious side effects of drugs of abuse. The physiological effects of methylxanthines have been known for a long time and they are mainly mediated by the so-called adenosine receptors. Caffeine and theobromine are the most abundant methylxanthines in cacao and their physiological effects are notable. Their health-promoting benefits are so remarkable that chocolate is explored as a functional food. The consequences of adenosine receptor blockade by natural compounds present in cacao/chocolate are here reviewed. Palatability and health benefits of methylxanthines, in general, and theobromine, in particular, have further contributed to sustain one of the most innocuous and pleasant habits: chocolate consumption.",

      "title": "Possible Consequences of Cannabis Legalization - What Do Research Show?",
      "abstract": "Indian hemp (lat. Cannabis sativa subs. Indica) has been used as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, food, medicine for some somatic diseases, and it is also used as a psychoactive substance. Cannabis can be used by smoking, evaporation, as a food ingredient, or as an extract. Acute and chronic cannabis use has been shown to be detrimental to several aspects of psychological and physical health and many experimental studies done on healthy people indicate the potential of Δ9- tetra hydro cannabinoid (THC) in inducing transient, dose-dependent psychotic symptoms, but also affective, behavioral, cognitive, neurovegetative, and psychophysical symptoms. Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug globally. In many communities, cannabis is perceived as a low-risk drug, leading to political lobbying to decriminalize its use. The wave of laws and initiatives to liberalize cannabis use continues to spread across the United States and the rest of the world, and there seems to be a political debate in the background about the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use. Aim is to present the possible consequences that the legalization of cannabis would have from the aspect of mental health and mental disorders.Authors reviewed the literature using PubMed resources on the effects of cannabis using the keywords: cannabis use, cannabis use and psychoticism, cannabis use and depression, cannabis use and anxiety, cannabis use and cognition, cannabis use and insomnia, legalization of cannabis.Authors examined the effects of cannabis use on psychiatric disorders and the review of the legal status of cannabis use in the world was also made. The possible consequences of cannabis legalization on the public health system were also considered, based on experiences from countries where legalization has already been done. The evidence cited in this article suggests that strong claims about the need to legalize cannabis are still questionable, and may, even in the long run, remain mixed, inconclusive, or even contradictory. Political interference in this issue can trigger a wide range of unintended but profound and lasting consequences for the health system and the health of the individual.We recommend further research on this topic and data collection with an emphasis on the effects and consequences of cannabis use on mental health, and in particular the benefits and harmful effects of medical cannabis use.",

      "title": "Successful Multiorgan Donation From a Brain-dead Donor Following Liquid Nicotine Voluntary Intoxication: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The electronic cigarette was invented in 2003 by Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, as an alternative source of nicotine to traditional tobacco products and coincided with the development of some nicotine replacement therapies. From the beginning of 2004, it spread widely on Western European and American markets and subsequently worldwide. Instead of burning tobacco leaves, electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that aerosolize liquid nicotine by heating a solution that contains different proportions of nicotine, glycerol, propylene glycol, and flavoring agents.1 Nicotine is a hazardous, highly toxic, and very addictive substance extracted from tobacco leaves. Exposure to elevated doses of nicotine may cause acute intoxication and eventually acute respiratory and cardiovascular failure, dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death. Cases of nicotine intoxication after conventional cigarette exposure, transdermal nicotine patches, or tobacco leaves have been reported. Yet, as electronic cigarette use increases, so has the number of both accidental and voluntary liquid nicotine intoxications. Accidental or unintentional intoxication involves mainly children under 10 y of age, whereas that of older patients is most likely voluntary and considered a suicide attempt.1-4 We present a case of multiorgan donation from a brain-dead donor admitted to our unit after resuscitation from cardiorespiratory arrest due to a voluntary intake of liquid nicotine with an autolytic aim. CASE DESCRIPTION A 26-y-old male individual was found unconscious by his parents on the floor of his room. He had a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder from childhood, had given up cannabis, cocaine, and metilenedioximethanphetamine abuse, and had survived several suicide attempts, the last of which consisted of jumping from a fifth floor and resulted in L2 spinal cord injury, spastic syndrome, neurogenic bladder, and bowel dysfunction. He was under treatment with venlafaxine, mirtazapine, lorazepam, gabapentin, aripiprazole, levetiracetam, and baclofen. Upon arrival of the emergency medical service, the patient was in cardiorespiratory arrest, so advanced cardiac life support maneuvers were initiated and performed for 40 minutes. When asked, his parents reported finding an empty 50 mL bottle of liquid nicotine beside him but denied a smoking or vaping habit. After spontaneous circulation was restored, he was transferred to the hospital. On arrival, his vital signs were as follow: blood pressure: 140/70 mm Hg; heart rate: 90 beats/min; temperature: 37 °C; respiratory rate (on mechanical ventilation): 20 breaths/min; arterial blood gas analysis (sample drawn on arrival at the emergency department): pH: 6.77; Pco2: 101 mm Hg; Po2: 28.5 mm Hg; HCO3: 6.6 mmol/L; EB: –26.1 mmol/L; satO2: 19.3%. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where he was unresponsive, had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, fixed and dilated pupils, and abolished brainstem reflexes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests were as follow: leucocytes: 17.000/mm3, hemoglobin: 14.5 g/dL; platelets and coagulation tests were normal; serum creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase: 187 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase: 133; amylase: 160 U/L; and creatine kinase: 193 U/L. Arterial blood gas analysis after 6 h on mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen: pH: 7.37; Po2: 177 mm Hg; Pco2: 32.5 mm Hg; HCO3: 32.5 mmol/L; satO2: 100%. The electrocardiogram showed a regular sinus rhythm with a rate of 100/min and no abnormalities despite the long-lasting resuscitation maneuvers. Urine drug screening was positive for tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines, while urine sediment examination was normal. On admittance, a urine sample was obtained for testing the cotinine (nicotine metabolite) level and sent to the Reference Laboratory. The ELISA result was >2000 ng/mL (normal value <500 ng/mL). A few h after admittance, a diagnosis of clinical brain death was established through complete and protocolized neurological examination and then confirmed by electroencephalography, which showed a plain and unresponsive to pain 30-minute recording. The cause of death was hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy caused by prolonged cardiorespiratory arrest due to nicotine intoxication. In the abdominal echography, the liver was hyperechogenic with mild to moderate steatosis; both kidneys were normal, with good corticomedullary differentiation, and their length was 11.5 cm (on the long axis). Echocardiography showed a nondilated left ventricle, normal wall thickness, normal global systolic function (ejection fraction over 70%) without any altered segmental wall function and normal atria; the valves had a normal function and morphology, as well as the pericardium. The transplant coordinator was contacted. Family and judicial authorization for organ donation was requested (the latter is compulsory in Spain for violent deaths). The patient was proposed as a multiorgan donor, including heart, kidneys, and pancreas. The liver was discarded due to analytic and echographic disturbances. The Spanish National Transplant Organization organized the distribution of the organs according to a protocolized schedule. Organ retrieval surgery was uneventful. The heart recipient was a 60-y-old male individual, with a recent history of coronary artery disease who had suffered acute coronary syndrome followed by cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular rupture. He was placed on the waiting list as a code 0 patient and received a heart transplant on the sixth d, with a cold ischemia time of 6 h and 100 minutes on an extracorporeal pump. He was discharged from the ICU to the general ward on postoperative d 6 and discharged 9 d later. He presented some infectious complications in the follow-up, mainly cytomegalovirus pneumonia and a Stenotrophomonas maltophilia urinary infection, with a favorable outcome after admittance to the ICU. Evolution was then uneventful, and no complication was subsequently reported. One y after transplantation, he underwent coronarography, and the result was normal. The pancreas and left kidney were transplanted to a 30-y-old female individual, with type 1 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, and bad metabolic control, with dialysis treatment initiated 3 y and 19 d earlier. She spent 14 mo and 16 d on the waiting list. After receiving her double organ transplant (left kidney and pancreas), both grafts showed adequate function on the first postoperative d, and she was discharged on postoperative d 14. The plasma creatinine level was 1.01 mg/dL upon discharge and 1.2 mg/dL 1 y after transplantation with a full metabolic recovery. The right kidney was transplanted to a 26-y-old female individual, with IgA nephropathy, with dialysis treatment initiated 3 y, 11 mo, and 25 d earlier. The right kidney of the donor was transplanted to the left side of the recipient. Adequate graft function was confirmed in the operating theater as urine output started by the end of surgery. She had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative d 13 with a plasma creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. One y later, her plasma creatinine level was 1 mg/dL. DISCUSSION The popularity of e-cigarettes has increased since their commercialization; the reports of liquid nicotine intoxication, both accidental and voluntary as suicide attempts, have become more and more frequent, given the wide availability of e-liquids containing highly concentrated nicotine. The most frequent symptoms are nausea, vomiting, agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, headache, and altered mental status; higher doses of nicotine intoxication lead to severe tachycardia and arrhythmias, seizures, acute hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, cardiovascular collapse, and cardiac arrest.2-6 Because no specific antidote is available, the appropriate treatment is cardiopulmonary support in the ICU. The most frequent cause of death after nicotine intoxication is related to cardiac events, though acute cerebral pathology cannot be excluded. The actual lethal dose of nicotine is unknown; after oral ingestion, nicotine is absorbed and quickly metabolized by the liver into its inactive metabolites, the most stable and abundant of which is cotinine. Due to short half-life of nicotine (2–3 h), levels of cotinine concentration are frequently used as a surrogate marker of nicotine intoxication levels. Despite the high toxicity of a nicotine overdose, we have documented a case of successful multiorgan donation, including kidneys, pancreas, and heart from a brain-dead donor after a lethal nicotine intoxication and successful resuscitation from a cardiorespiratory arrest. This appears to be the first case of multiorgan donation following liquid nicotine intoxication reported in the literature so far. In 2017, Räsänen et al7 reported a case of kidney donation after brain death caused by a subcutaneous nicotine overdose in an attempted suicide. The patient was a 29-y-old woman with a history of severe depression and obesity who subcutaneously injected 10 mL of liquid nicotine after an intake of alcohol and diazepam. She was taken to hospital, still conscious but anxious on admission. In the emergency department, she had seizures followed by cardiorespiratory arrest. She was successfully resuscitated and admitted to the ICU, where she experienced an unfavorable course and eventually brain death. She was accepted as a kidney donor resulting in 2 successful transplantations: 2 women, aged 39 and 43 y, both with diabetic nephropathy as the cause of their end-stage renal disease. Both had an uneventful postoperative recovery and were discharged on postoperative d 9. On their follow-up, both were doing well, with normal plasma creatinine levels. In our case, the liver was discarded for transplantation due to altered aminotransferases, hyperechoic texture on ultrasonography in addition to the fact that the liver is the organ responsible for high-dose nicotine metabolism. Kidneys and pancreas were accepted for transplantation after confirming adequate laboratory tests and echographic data. To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature on renal failure after a nicotine overdose. After being transplanted, both kidneys and pancreas started to function within the first few h; dialysis was unnecessary and good function of the kidneys was present in the follow-up 1 y later. Regarding the heart, the decision to transplant was supported by the optimal electrocardiographic and echocardiographic record, the lack of elevated enzymes, and the hemodynamic stability of the donor after brain death, although the recent event of cardiac arrest and resuscitation maneuvers were an issue to be considered. As previously mentioned, heart transplantation was successful, and the recipient was doing well in his 1-y follow-up. The shortage of organs for transplantation has led transplant teams to consider brain-dead patients after fatal intoxications as potential candidates for donation. There is a growing number of cases in the literature reporting acceptable outcomes of organ procuring and transplant, most of them published as isolated cases. Successful kidney transplants have been documented from brain-dead donors after insulin or carbamazepine intoxication.8 Organ procurement after carbon monoxide intoxication has been discouraged, but successful multiorgan transplants have been reported, and an absolute contraindication is no longer accepted.9,10 Regarding illicit drug intoxications leading to brain death, there is an increase in the number of such patients recruited for organ donation. Solid organs transplanted after cocaine-related death do not show a worse outcome than those from noncocaine users, with some issues regarding heart transplant.10 Similarly, posttransplant survival of opioid-intoxicated donor hearts and lungs is similar to that from nonintoxicated donors.11,12 Even when dealing with brain-dead donors after ingestion of toxic substances mainly metabolized by the liver as, for instance, ethylene glycol or brodifacoum, a rodenticide with a potent anticoagulant effect, good graft outcome and acceptable recipient survival have been reported in the literature. Liver biopsy, hemodialysis to accelerate toxic clearance, and verification of the absence of the toxic substance in blood samples are the suggested strategies to optimize results.13-15 Liquid nicotine is a widely available, increasingly popular, and insufficiently regulated substance. Attention should be paid to the potential lethal risk of liquid nicotine intoxication, and efforts should be made to devise more thorough surveillance and avoid such unfortunate events. In case of lethal nicotine intoxication, multiorgan retrieval for donation may be considered, bearing in mind the recommendation of measuring nicotine metabolites in blood samples or even undertaking donor liver biopsy before performing the procedure.",

      "abstract": "In general, for proper administration of medications, patients should follow the label instructions carefully. Some medications should be taken with a full glass of water; some must be taken with food, while others should be taken on an empty stomach. Patients should consult with a physician or pharmacist to determine if there are any foods that should be avoided while taking their medications. Yet for many reasons, patients rarely ask about which foods should be avoided. In some instances, patients will be instructed to take their medication with a particular food or beverage to aid palatability (and hence compliance), minimize local irritation to the gastrointestinal tract, or aid in drug absorption. However, importantly, there are many incidences when the consumption of specific foods in combination with certain medications presents a problem by interfering with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of these drugs. If these instances go unrecognized, there may be significant divergence of therapeutic drug levels, and hence therapeutic effects and possible drug-related adverse events. This chapter highlights some of the main instances where concomitant ingestion of particular foods or beverages can interfere with medication action and then reviews how a better understanding of these interactions can sometimes be used to aid in patient management.",

O uso desta substancia durante o periodo gestacional tem aumentado drasticamente durante as ultimas decadas. Em alguns casos o recem-nascido exposto a cocaina, aparentemente, nao apresenta qualquer tipo de comprometimento ou problemas neurologicos, entretanto, com o passar do tempo manifesta alteracoes que comprometem sua condicao fisica e neurologica.  OBJETIVO; Descrever o que a literatura tem apontado sobre o uso da cocaina por mulheres durante a gestacao e as consequencias para as criancas Metodologia: Trata-se de uma revisao da literatura. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSAO: A exposicao fetal diante a cocaina provoca diversos desfechos neonatais desfavoraveis para bebe, tanto fisiologica quanto psicologicamente. A literatura aponta como principais consequencias cefalicas reduzidas para a idade, dificuldade no ganho de peso e alteracoes no desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor, podendo acarretar disturbios comportamentais, de linguagem e deficit motor. Alem disso, a cocaina, suprime o apetite materno e coopera para deficiencia nutricional que, por conseguinte, prejudica os depositos de gordura fetais e diminui a massa corporal. CONCLUSAO: Destaca-se, o grande desafio aos profissionais de saude, em especial aqueles da Estrategia Saude da Familia em planejar estrategias de prevencao de drogas, em especial no periodo gestacional, bem como utilizar a Politica de Reducao de danos. Outro cuidado importante e o acompanhamento minucioso dos recem nascidos filhos de maes usuarias de cocaina, com vistas a deteccao precoce de alteracoes.  Aliado a isso, faz-se necessario o acolhimento e busca ativa dessas maes e suas criancas a fim de elaborar estrategias com foco na promocao da saude e a qualidade de vidas criancas, transmitindo informacoes sobre os riscos inerentes a cada fase do desenvolvimento infantil, Por fim, acredita-se que os resultados do presente estudo possam contribuir para o estabelecimento de acoes educativas e preventivas voltadas para uso de cocaina e as consequencias para crianca.",

Because tobacco is so addictive, the typical adolescent smoker can look forward to a lifetime addiction, reduced quality of life and premature death. A long‐term solution to this problem must include action to postpone or inhibit adolescents from taking up smoking. Advertising research indicates that a message is more effective if the target audience experiences a feeling of involvement in it. It must also communicate new, important information that engages the audience at a cognitive and affective level and is readily verifiable against the audience’s own experience. It follows that the threat of addiction should be used as the key message in a campaign to reduce the incidence of adolescent cigarette smoking. This threat is potentially salient for adolescents. It is concrete and immediate, not merely a promise of increased statistical probabilities 30 or more years into the future. It is also readily verifiable from the adolescent’s own experience. It may also be worth focusing on other consequent losses that flow from the addiction.",

Beginning in the early 1960s, however, the use and abuse of new and nonconventional psychoactive substances became increasingly common among young people of many socioeconomic strata—most notably among the middle class. During its formative stages, the use of such drugs (primarily marijuana and LSD) was associated with what has commonly been termed a youth movement oriented toward the creation of a new consciousness. Psychedelic drugs were viewed in the esoteric sense as sacraments, and in the most mundane sense as pleasant and harmless means of enhancing one's sense of well-being. In any event, the prevalent rationalizations underlying the use of such substances were couched in philosophical terms. Psychotogens (especially LSD) were seen by many as liberating agents, aids in engendering new and better qualities of being in those who used them.",

      "abstract": "Objetivo: Reunir e descrever as principais repercussões clínicas que o consumo excessivo dos cigarros eletrônicos pode causar na saúde e qualidade de vida dos usuários. Revisão bibliográfica: O uso de Cigarros Eletrônicos (CE) gera impactos negativos importantes no organismo humano. Os seus compostos químicos acometem, principalmente, o sistema pulmonar através do mecanismo de aumento de citocinas pró-inflamatórias. Além disso, também repercute nos sistemas cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurológico e oftalmológico, na saúde bucal e mental, bem como acarreta prejuízos se utilizado durante o período gestacional. Esses aspectos serão discutidos ao longo deste trabalho. Apesar das proibições da ANVISA, esses dispositivos continuam sendo comercializados clandestinamente, o que levanta preocupações sobre a segurança desses produtos. Considerações finais: Embora tenha surgido como uma alternativa para reduzir o consumo de cigarros convencionais, esses aparelhos apresentam efeitos adversos à saúde a depender da substância que é inalada. Portanto, é crucial promover maior clareza na fabricação desses dispositivos para assegurar e conscientizar os consumidores.",

      "abstract": "A pesar de toda la informacion que se difunde desde el sector sanitario y a traves de los medios de comunicacion, siguen existiendo mujeres gestantes consumidoras de drogas durante el embarazo. Aunque los habitos toxicos maternos hayan cambiado en los ultimos anos, las enfermedades observadas en fetos y neonatos no presentan diferencias. Los hijos de madres consumidoras de drogas de abuso, legales o no, estan asociados a un elevado porcentaje de prematuridad, aborto, bajo peso, sindrome de abstinencia, infecciones asociadas, problemas sociofamiliares, etc. El consumo mas habitual es el de tabaco, que aunque parece estar disminuyendo, todavia sigue siendo un problema. Existe un alto porcentaje de personas que no saben realmente que efectos pueden producir determinadas drogas. Muchos piensan que fumar un par de cigarrillos al dia no es perjudicial para el feto, asi como el tomarse una cerveza o una copa de vino al dia o en el fin de semana. Desde hace 30 anos se ha querido intervenir sobre el problema de las drogas en la poblacion, elaborando multiples programas que buscaban basicamente la abstinencia de las drogas, pero no han dado grandes resultados. En los ultimos anos se han puesto en marcha programas como el de �reduccion del dano�, que no buscan la abstinencia sino mejorar el estado de salud de los drogodependientes, asi como el de mantenimiento con metadona o el de evitacion del intercambio de jeringuillas, que si han demostrado disminuir notablemente los problemas relacionados con las mismas como la delincuencia o las enfermedades infecciosas. La puesta en marcha de programas de prevencion y la concienciacion de la poblacion son un pilar fundamental para disminuir el consumo y sus consecuencias. La captacion de casos y su seguimiento de cerca son acciones muy importantes para evitar secuelas mayores, asi como el conocimiento por parte del personal sanitario del manejo de estas situaciones.",

Energy drinks are aggressively marketed with the claim that these products give an energy boost to improve physical and cognitive performance. However, studies supporting these claims are limited. In fact, several adverse health effects have been related to energy drink; this has raised the question of whether these beverages are safe. This review was carried out to identify and discuss the published articles that examined the beneficial and adverse health effects related to energy drink. It is concluded that although energy drink may have beneficial effects on physical performance, these products also have possible detrimental health consequences. Marketing of energy drinks should be limited or forbidden until independent research confirms their safety, particularly among adolescents.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy and possible health risks of pepper spray were evaluated. In a number of countries, pepper spray is being used by police forces to aid in arresting aggressive individuals. Pepper spray is commercially available as a canister filled with Capsicum extract, which contains capsaicin as the active component. When applied in the form of a spray, it causes an acute inflammation, and humans involuntarily close their eyes, experience a burning feeling on the skin, and are usually rapidly incapacitated. Use by the U.S. police was successful in subduing aggressive individuals in 90% of cases, and a reduction of injury to both police and arrested individuals was noted. In general, pepper spray appeared to be a relatively safe weapon with small risk of causing acute physical harm. Despite this evidence, a number of fatalities were reported in the United States following the use of pepper spray. However, it was concluded that it was not the pepper spray but rather other factors such as drugs and hog-tying that contributed to the cause of death. In only 1 case, that of an asthmatic man, was it concluded that the use of pepper spray contributed to the cause of death. Much attention has been paid to possible genotoxic effects of Capsicum extract such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. It was concluded that the risk of long-term health effects is negligible. Because pepper spray may induce bronchoconstriction, people suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease may be hypersensitive to it. Although the results of one study indicate that asthmatics do not develop additional bronchoconstriction following inhalation of capsaicin, the number of experimental data are too few to draw sound conclusions.",

However, not all female smokers have the same concerns about weight, and not all quitters are equally susceptible to gaining weight after cessation. We hypothesized that among females, dieters, compared to nondieters, would report more weight gain after smoking cessation and would tend to smoke more for weight control purpose.Undergraduate college students were surveyed to assess their smoking status, dieting status, postcessation weight gain, and their motivations to smoke.Among former smokers, dieters reported considerably more weight gain than nondieters. Dieters were more likely to have started, and to have continued smoking in order to control their weight, and among current smokers, dieters reported having had shorter quit attempts.The dieters/former smokers' comparatively high weight gain after smoking cessation is discussed in terms of possible changes in dietary intake, metabolic rate, and physical activity.",

It appears that the major route of drug appearance in milk is via diffusion from the maternal circulation. In general, maternal plasma levels of a drug dictate milk levels. Un-ionized drugs with high lipid solubility and minimal binding to maternal plasma protein diffuse best. The amount of a drug excreted in milk is usually not more than 1 to 2% of the maternal dose. Most studies have been done with single-dose or short-term drug administration. Very few data are available for the mother who receives continuous drug therapy. Environmental chemicals such as insecticides are also a cause for special concern. They are highly lipid soluble and may remain in body fat for very long periods. Indeed, lactation may be the only route of elimination. The effect of even small amounts of these agents on the growing infant is unknown. Further studies are needed to determine the amount of these agents secreted and the possible risk to the nursing infant.",

Methods : The research method used was literature review. As for the nature of this studt is a descriptive analysis, which is a regular break from fasting to health, then an explanation is given for the reader to read well. Results: The study result in that fast devoted to disease are called Intermittent fasting. The detoxification process will occur naturally in the human body that regularly performs intermittent fasting, eventually improving its resistance. Conclusion : The conclusion is that intermittent fasting can improve health status, either improving body immunity and or disease treatment. It must also be offset by implementing a healthy lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose of Review Review recent research regarding the relationship between cannabis use, weight, eating behaviors, eating disorders, and physical activity. Recent Findings Cannabis, particularly the cannabinoid Δ9-tegrahydrocannabinol (THC), is associated with increased appetite, food cravings, overconsumption, and decreased physical activity. Cannabidiol (CBD) appears to be associated with decreased appetite. While cannabis use is not correlated with binge eating, cannabis use disorder is associated with loss of control eating. Despite cannabis’ association with unhealthy eating and sedentary behavior, most studies suggest that cannabis use is not associated with weight gain, or may even facilitate weight loss. Summary The state of the literature regarding the relationship between cannabis, weight, and weight-related behaviors is complex. Most studies do not differentiate between cannabinoid profiles, routes of administration, or whether cannabis use is problematic. Patients presenting for weight management should be cautioned about cannabis, particularly THC, potentially increasing risk of unhealthy eating and activity patterns.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol drinking has been intrinsic to human social evolution certainly from the period when change from hunter-gather to farmer took place, which in many societies dates from 10,000 or more years ago.Throughout much of that time the risk of water-borne diseases such as enteric fever was such that there were undoubted health benefits to consumption of alcoholic beverages, such as mead, beer, cider and wine, in preference to contaminated water.Further benefit may also be that fermented drinks provided a means of storing food energy when preservation methods such as freezing had yet to be developed.These benefits were no longer critical once efficient sanitation and safe water supplies and food storage technologies had been developed from the mid-19 th century.The study of fermentation has contributed enormously to medicine providing drugs or their precursors as diverse as antibiotics and statins.During human cultural evolution alcohol has frequently been a key part of religious and fertility rites and of social activities, such as feasting.However, the introduction of cheap, distilled, alcoholic drinks, such as gin, in the late 17 th century was damaging to society and in modern times evidence for any health advantages to drinking alcohol is lacking.The threshold consumption below which no harm can be observed is low or non-existent.Whereas prohibition can be effective in theocracies as demonstrated by transnational statistics on alcohol consumption, historically, attempts to enforce prohibition solely by legislation have generally been disastrous in non-sectarian societies.The scale of the industries producing alcohol is vast and many drinks, particularly wine are intimately ingrained into many cultures.Taxation is a traditional means of curbing excess consumption and there may be a case for banning certain types of alcoholic products and advertising, but draconian measures will lead to increased crime through illegal drinking and the misuse of other recreational drugs.It should not be assumed that lessons from the success in reducing smoking can be directly translated into limitation of alcohol use to improve health.",

      "abstract": "Apart from evidence on the acute effects of passive smoking, there is relatively little information available on whether breathing other people's smoke at work causes disease. However, exposure does commonly occur at work, and it does not differ qualitatively from passive smoking occurring in other settings. Therefore it appears sensible to extrapolate from what is known about health risks in settings such as the home. There is too little known to quantify precisely workplace risks due to passive smoking. However, the weight and consistency of the epidemiologic evidence, backed up by the data from active smoking, favor a causal link between passive smoking and serious disease, especially lung cancer. In the light of this evidence, enough is known to justify action to reduce smoking at work.",

Here, we investigate whether workers display one of the key features of alcoholism, namely withdrawal symptoms. We show that workers fed for a prolonged time on food spiked with ethanol, after discontinuation of access to such food, exhibited a marked increase in the consumption of ethanol and a slight increase in mortality. We additionally show that withdrawal symptoms do not include an increase in appetitiveness of ethanol diluted in water. Our results demonstrate that workers can develop alcohol dependence, which might be especially important in the natural setting of repeated exposure to ethanol in floral nectar and for their potential as a model of alcohol addiction.",

      "title": "Do Maladaptive Schemas Put Young People at Risk for Addiction?",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nThe use of psychoactive drugs is a wide spread phenomenon which occurs in virtually all cultures of the world. Most people who consume psychoactive substances may control their consumption well over their whole life span and even draw benefits from it (1). In a minority of the users, however, controlled drug use can make a transition to drug addiction. This is a psychiatric disorder which requires treatment, or even better, prevention. Although drug use is the ‘conditio sine qua none’ of developing drug addiction, there are additional factors that contribute significantly to the risk. There are genetic (2) and epigenetic factors (3, 4), and there are environmental factors. These environmental factors may be further distinguished in passively incurred and actively developed factors (5). Passively incurred factors may be the experience of a natural disaster or a major private loss, which may then trigger the escalation of drug consumption. But there are also actively developed environmental factors. One group of them is the schemas that people form. These are patterns of beliefs and thoughts about oneself, others, and the environment, which shape how we perceive our environment, how we form memories and how we generate behavior. These schemas are acquired starting in early life. They can be helpful or maladaptive. Young et al. (6) had identified eighteen maladaptive schemas which were grouped in five areas: 1) disconnection/rejection, 2) impaired autonomy/performance, 3) impaired limits, 4) other directedness and 5) over vigilance/inhibition. These schemas are believed to foster negative experiences in life and produce a rather insufficient coping with psychological pressure. Positive schemas, in contrast, allow people to experience more positive experiences and allow for a better coping with stressful life events. Previous studies have shown that an enhanced rate of early established maladaptive schemas is found in drug users (7, 8). While genetic, epigenetic and also passively incurred environmental factors can only explain a small proportion of the addiction risk, it is currently unclear which role actively developed factors might play.\r\n\r\nBakhshi Bojed and Nikmanesh asked in their study whether the establishment of maladaptive schemas increases addiction potential of young people and whether these early maladaptive schemas can predict addiction potential. To address this question they investigated 260 students (159 females, 101 males) of the University of Sistan and Baluchestan in the year 2011-12. They were all young adults 19-25 years of age. All subjects were administered the Addiction Potential Scale questionnaire to evaluate current addiction potential. In order to measure early maladaptive schemas, the young schema questionnaire – short form was used. The main finding of this study was a significant positive correlation between addiction potential and all of the five areas of early maladaptive schemas (disconnection/rejection, impaired autonomy and performance, Impaired limits, other-directedness and over vigilance/inhibition). In a regression analysis the authors identified the schema of disconnection/rejection as the most influential factor, which alone determined already 0.16 of the variance in the addiction potential. Together with the schemas ‘impaired autonomy’ and ‘other-directedness’ it explained 0.19 of the variance (9). These findings clearly suggest that there is a strong relationship between early maladaptive schemas and the addiction potential in young adults. Maladaptive schemas are established early in life often by family interactions. In fact, offspring copies the schemas of parents, family members or even peers. This may explain why there is a high inheritance of the addiction risk (10), but only a small part of it appears genetically or epigenetically transmitted. As the present study shows, an increasingly big role might be played by inherited schemas, where children simply copy maladaptive schemas of their parents. Maladaptive schemas not only predict addiction as it was shown in previous studies (7, 8), but already the addiction potential. Thus, they may well suit as screening instruments to identify people at increased risk of addiction and may allow focusing prevention programs in the future.",

Although this cultural integration of caffeine use can make the identification of psychiatric disorders associated with caffeine use difficult, it is important for the psychiatrist to appreciate the role of caffeine as a psychoactive substance capable of producing a variety of psychiatric syndromes. In this chapter, five disorders associated with caffeine use are reviewed: caffeine intoxication, caffeine withdrawal, caffeine dependence, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, and caffeine-induced sleep disorder.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of premature death, and it is currently listed as a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Because of restrictive measures and widespread control policies, tobacco companies are now using aggressive marketing strategies in favor of smokeless tobacco, including electronic nicotine delivery systems, which are also known as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Although the regular use of these devices appears less hazardous than traditional cigarettes or other forms of smokeless tobacco, recent studies have shown that various potentially harmful substances, especially nicotine, ultraparticles, and volatile organic compounds, may be effectively inhaled or liberated in exhaled air during repeated e-cigarette puffing. This would enhance the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, which may predispose some users to increased risk of cardiovascular events, which may be further magnified by other potential adverse effects such as arrhythmias, increased respiratory, and flow respiratory resistance. Some cases of intoxication have also been described, wherein large amounts of nicotine and other harmful compounds may be effectively absorbed. As the use of e-cigarettes is continuously rising, and it is also considered a potentially effective method for smoking cessation, more focused research is urgently needed to definitely establish the cardiovascular safeness of these devices.",

The pharmaceutical drugs commonly causing poisoning among children include iron medications, analgesics, antipyretics and hypnotics. Sometimes the cases of poisoning arise from ingestion of household substances such as kerosene and detergents. In rural areas, kerosene is still extensively used for lighting lamps and cooking. Increasingly in recent years, pesticides have caused numerous cases of poisoning, many of which are children.

Στα πλαίσια αυτά η παρούσα μελέτη επιχειρεί να εμπλουτίσει με δεδομένα τη σχετικά περιορισμένη ελληνική βιβλιογραφία σχετικά με τους παράγοντες που επηρεάζουν την στάση των παιδιών και των εφήβων προς το κάπνισμα και έτσι να προσφέρει μια ισχυρή βάση για την επιλογή πολιτικών και την εφαρμογή προγραμμάτων πρόληψης. Μεθοδολογία. Διεξήχθη μια στρωματοποιημένη τυχαία δειγματοληπτική μελέτη σε Δημοτικά, Γυμνάσια και Λύκεια όλης της χωράς όπου παρουσία του ερευνητή αλλά ανώνυμα συμπληρώθηκαν τα ερωτηματολόγια της μελέτης. Αποτελέσματα Ανάμεσα στους έφηβους το 57.2% δεν έχει δοκιμάσει ποτέ να καπνίσει το 23.1% έχει δοκιμάσει τουλάχιστον μια φορά το 6.7% καπνίζει περιστασιακά και το 13% είναι τακτικοί καπνιστές. Το κάπνισμα των γονέων και ακόμα περισσότερο των αδελφών σχετίστηκε ισχυρά με την καπνιστική συμπεριφορά των εφήβων. Η αναμενόμενη αντίδραση των γονέων στην έναρξη του καπνίσματος αλλά και η σχέση τους με τους έφηβους σχετίστηκαν επίσης ισχυρά. Η επιρροή των συνομήλικων βρέθηκε επίσης ισχυρή. Τα παιδιά και οι έφηβοι έδειξαν να θεωρούν την καπνιστική συμπεριφορά την κανονικά αναμενόμενη. Η διαδικασία της κανονικοποίησης της συνήθειας επιτυγχάνεται κυρίως μέσω της διαφήμισης άμεσης και έμμεσης. Αν και η ενημερότητα των νέων για τις επιπτώσεις του καπνίσματος στην υγεία φαίνεται ικανοποιητικά υψηλή αυτή δεν φαίνεται να τους αποτρέπει από το να καπνίσουν ενώ για δυο ζητήματα (ασφαλές επίπεδο καπνίσματος και θέματα εξάρτησης) οι γνώσεις τους είναι επικίνδυνα χαμηλές. Αν και γενικά εκφράζουν αρνητική άποψη για το κάπνισμα και τους καπνιστές αναγνωρίζουν παράλληλα και θετικές όψεις και πιθανά προσδοκόμενα οφέλη από τη συνήθεια. Οι έφηβοι καπνιστές ανέφεραν περισσότερα προβλήματα στο Youth Self Report ιδιαίτερα μάλιστα στα Προβλήματα Προσοχής, την Παραπτωματική και Επιθετική Συμπεριφορά, τα Προβλήματα Εξωτερίκευσης και τα Συνολικά Προβλήματα.

      "title": "Diseño de una bebida con elevado contenido en polifenoles y estudio de su efecto sobre la evolución del estrés oxidativo en enfermos de Alzheimer",
      "abstract": "En el mundo industrializado se ha pasado de la preocupacion por la seguridad alimentaria y la satisfaccion del hambre, a la busqueda del potencial de los alimentos para promover y mejorar la salud. Debido a esta tendencia, se han desarrollado los alimentos funcionales. Un alimento puede ser denominado como ?funcional? si se demuestra que tiene un efecto beneficioso sobre una o mas funciones del organismo, mas alla de los efectos nutricionales tradicionales, de manera que sea relevante tanto para mejorar el estado de salud como para reducir el riesgo de enfermedad. Las bebidas ricas en antioxidantes son un ejemplo de este tipo de alimentos. Los flavonoides son el mayor grupo de antioxidantes polifenolicos, y numerosos estudios han demostrado tanto su actividad in vitro como in vivo para prevenir o reducir los efectos nocivos de moleculas altamente oxidantes, como son las especies reactivas de oxigeno y de nitrogeno, y de moleculas proinflamatorias. La enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) es un desorden neurodegenerativo cronico, caracterizado por una perdida progresiva de las funciones cognitivas e intelectuales, especialmente la memoria. Las principales caracteristicas neuropatologicas de esta enfermedad consisten en una perdida de celulas neuronales, asi como un deposito de placas seniles extracelulares y ovillos neurofibrilares intracelulares. Debido a estas lesiones, la neuroinflamacion es una caracteristica patologica de la EA. Ademas de la neuroinflamacion, existe un incremento importante del estres oxidativo (EO), evidenciado por el incremento, tanto en la sangre como en el cerebro del enfermo, de los niveles de biomarcadores de peroxidacion lipidica, oxidacion del ADN y ARN, oxidacion proteica y glicoxidacion, asi como alteraciones en las defensas antioxidantes del organismo. El objetivo general de esta tesis fue disenar una nueva bebida con alto poder antioxidante, en base a un elevado contenido en antioxidantes polifenolicos, y analizar su efecto sobre biomarcadores de EO e inflamacion en enfermos de Alzheimer, en distintas fases de la enfermedad. La nueva bebida antioxidante (BA) disenada, basada en extractos de te verde y manzana, es un producto alimenticio con buenas propiedades organolepticas, con una alta actividad antioxidante y estable a temperatura ambiente, por lo que no necesita refrigeracion. Antes de empezar la ingesta de las bebidas, los valores de GPx en los enfermos de Alzheimer en fase inicial (EAI) fueron menores que en los controles (C). Sin embargo, los niveles de SOD y carbonilos proteicos fueron mayores en los enfermos de Alzheimer que en los C. Respecto a los enfermos de Alzheimer en fase moderada (EAM), los valores del TAS y GPx fueron menores que en los C. Por el contrario, los niveles de SOD, carbonilos proteicos y LDL-ox fueron mayores que en los C, todo ello antes de comenzar con la administracion de las bebidas. La ingesta de la BA previno, en los enfermos de Alzheimer, la disminucion del TAS en la fase moderada de la enfermedad, incremento los valores de GPx y SOD en la fase inicial y moderada, y previno el incremento de los niveles de carbonilos proteicos en los EAM, con un descenso significativo de los carbonilos proteicos desde el cuarto mes de ingesta de la bebida en los EAI. La administracion de la BA a los pacientes de Alzheimer disminuyo significativamente los niveles sericos de varias citoquinas proinflamatorias, mientras que no se observaron dichos cambios para las citoquinas antiinflamatorias IL-4 y IL-10, siendo la BA mas efectiva contra la inflamacion en el periodo temprano de la enfermedad. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la BA podria ser usada como una terapia natural complementaria, para atenuar los sintomas del EO y la inflamacion en las distintas etapas de la EA.",

      "abstract": "Lifestyle modifications are first-line therapy for patients with overweight or obesity. The most effective weight loss intervention is one that includes a moderately reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity, and the use of behavior strategies to facilitate adherence. The goal should be a modest weight loss of 5% to 10% that can be maintained long term. Although individual studies have identified specific benefits associated with certain diets, no diet has been shown to be more effective than another. For substantial health benefits, adults should engage in at least 150 to 300 min/week of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 min/week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. Effective behavior strategies include the combination of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy. Other strategies include removal of environmental trigger foods, self distraction to help with cravings and boredom eating, and planning ahead. It is critical that children and adolescents avoid dieting or other consciously restrictive behaviors because these have been associated with weight gain and binge eating. Rather than weight, discussions with children and adolescents should focus on achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Physical activity should be encouraged from childhood through young adulthood.",

Very Important Role of Optimal Dose of Vitamin-D3 and Clothes You Wear in the Fight Against Malignancies Including Glioblastoma and Cancers of Breast, Lung, and Pancreas as well as Loss of Control of Infection du",
      "abstract": "Everything we eat or drink usually has an optimal dose which includes any medicine. Using optimal dose, we can obtain maximum improvement in our body with minimum amount. If you eat or drink more than 25 times the optimal dose it often creates serious toxic side effects. Particularly in the presence of electro-magnetic-field, often early stages of cancer develop. Strong EMF source such as cell phone is in the patient’s pocket, multiple organs near the cellular phone in the presence of EMF can develop early stages of multiple cancers. And, if anybody spends more than one hour in short distance with patients who has abnormally increased 8-OH-dG & integrin α5β1, oncogene c-Fos AB2 or increased Human Papillomavirus Type 16, cancer can become infectious to the people who stay in close distance for more than one hour including dentist with advanced cancer treating patients. But we found the optimal dose of Vitamin D3 has the most important 10 unique beneficial effects. Among them, most important 3 beneficial effects are: 1) Safe and most effective anti-cancer effect 2) It excretes viruses, bacteria, and fungus as well as toxic metals into urine 3) Acetylcholine significantly increases, which almost immediately improves brain circulation and the condition of the rest of the body, particularly improve memory and Alzheimer’s condition. However, Vitamin C is also required for the body. But when it exceeds a few hundred mg most important beneficial effects of optimal dose of Vitamin D3 effect will be inhibited and it will become highly harmful for the body. For some patients one cup of Vitamin C rich orange juice or lemon juice completely inhibits beneficial effects of optimal dose of Vitamin D3. Also without touching the patient’s body, at visible distance testing with Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, (which received a U.S. patent for non-invasive early diagnosis and treatment of cancers or cardio-vascular problems), strong BDORT negative (-) substance is touching the body surface inhibits beneficial effects of Vitamin D3. For example, blue jeans or often black underwear or BDORT strong negative (-) white artificial teeth or brassiere or lipstick which has strong negative (-) BDORT is touching the body surface, beneficial effect of optimal dose of Vitamin-D3 will be inhibited.",

Este ultimo e citado frequentemente como o principal motivo para a relutância em parar de fumar e recaida depois da cessacao,especialmente nos fumadores que apresentam preocupacoes com o seu peso.

      "title": "Strategies to Help Patients Break the Chains of Tobacco Addiction: Evidence-Based Treatments Can Help Patients Quit despite Psychiatric Illness",
      "abstract": "You are treating Mr. P, age 34, for schizoaffective disorder. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and has smoked for approximately 17 years. He has tried to stop but never has been able to quit for more than a few weeks. He reveals whenever he tries to quit, he starts feeling extremely lethargic and and resumes smoking to prevent these symptoms from worsening. However, Mr. P expresses some interest in trying to quit again and asks whether any medications could prevent him from becoming depressed while he tries to quit Cigarette smoking is overrepresented and undertreated among individuals with psychiatric illness, in part because of the largely unfounded belief held by some patients and clinicians that smoking cessation might worsen psychiatric symptoms. In this article, we argue this challenge can be overcome and psychiatrists and other mental health professionals can and should help their patients reap the innumerable benefits of quitting smoking. We discuss: * the short-and long-term effects of smoking cessation * evidence-based treatment guidelines for working with motivated and unmotivated smokers * unique issues that may arise when treating smokers who have psychiatric disorders. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Quitting: Profound benefits Quitting smoking has substantial benefits beginning within minutes after taking the last puff. Some of the benefits that occur within the first few days of quitting include: * decreased blood pressure and pulse rate * improved circulation * improved ability to smell and taste * easier breathing. Longer-term smoking abstinence drastically reduces risk of heart attack, stroke, cancer, respiratory disease, and a host of other illnesses that affect--and kill--individuals with psychiatric disorders several decades earlier than their counterparts in the general population. (1) There also are financial benefits to quitting; using the 2009 national average of $5.33 per pack, a 1-pack-per-day smoker who quits would save > $150 per month, which accounts for only the direct cost of cigarettes. (2) Although the beneficial effects of quitting smoking are profound and far-reaching, in the short-term they are counterbalanced by nicotine withdrawal symptoms--including restlessness, irritability, depressed mood, concentration problems, and increased appetite/weight gain--that are formidable distractions from the positive aspects of quitting. Additionally nicotine withdrawal symptoms tend to be more severe in smokers who have a psychiatric disorder. (3) Fortunately, there are effective, evidence-based methods of reducing withdrawal symptoms and helping smokers cope with these and other challenges of quitting. Combined treatment is best Current treatment guidelines (4) suggest all smokers should be offered pharmacotherapy and counseling to aid quitting because this combined approach has the highest success rate (Algorithm). Table 1 (page 44) (4) provides information about dosing, efficacy, and side effect profile of each of the 7 FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation. Using any of the approved medications at least doubles the odds of successful quitting compared with placebo. (4) These pharmacotherapies can reduce or prevent nicotine withdrawal symptoms and--at least in the case of bupropion and varenicline--decrease reinforcement from smoking, thereby lowering the likelihood a lapse (ie, smoking [greater than or equal to] 1 cigarettes without returning to regular smoking) will develop into a full-blown relapse (ie, return to regular smoking).

      "title": "Does urge to drink predict relapse after treatment?",
      "abstract": "The urge to drink, also often referred to as craving, is an emotional state in which a person is motivated to seek and use alcohol. In abstinent alcoholics, this urge may contribute to the risk of relapse. Researchers have developed several models--including the conditioned withdrawal model, conditioned appetitive motivational model, social learning model, and information-processing model--to describe the role of urges in relapse. Several studies have evaluated the role of urges in predicting alcoholism treatment outcome and relapse. Some findings indicate that the degree of urge an alcoholic experiences when confronted with a simulated high-risk situation at the end of alcoholism treatment can predict subsequent drinking. Other studies, however, show inconsistent results regarding the role of urges in predicting treatment outcome. Overall, the study results suggest that urges do not necessarily increase the risk of relapse but may actually protect some drinkers against further drinking.",

This practice remains a global budden and deaths caused by smoking-related conditions is believed to have escalated. Many countries in the world have policies in place that regulate the production, transportation, handling and utilization of tobacco products in order to compact this budden of smoking. Despite these effort, various contributing factors of smoking amongst which peer-pressure forms part, are believed to be cause of an increase in the number of new smokers. Nicotine is one of the constituents of tobacco smoke which causes a pleasant feelings which in return contributes to addiction. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals with some known to be carcinogens. Smoking during pregnancy poses danger to a pregnant mother and her unborn babe as they exchange blood. The public needs to be educated on the danger of smoking, and exposure to second-hand smoke as well as on strategies that one can follow to quit smoking.",

The effects of caffeine ingestion and cigarette smoking on caffeine and antipyrine pharmacokinetics were studied using normal subjects as their own controls before and after cessation of smoking in an attempt to minimize genetic and other environmental influences. 2. Moderate caffeine ingestion had no inducing effect on caffeine or antipyrine clearance. 3. Cessation of cigarette smoking significantly reduced clearance of caffeine and antipyrine. 4. These results demonstrate that cigarette smoking significantly affects caffeine pharmacokinetics and this may contribute to the variable results for caffeine kinetics found in patients with liver disease.",

De plus les conséquences pour la santé ne sont pas absentes, qu’elles soient psychiatriques ou somatiques.

      "abstract": "Abstract The association between cigarette use and Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been well known in the literature since more than 50 years ago. Large population studies showed that smokers developed PD less often than non-smokers and that the duration of smoking was inversely proportional to PD risk. There are two primary hypotheses for this association in the literature. First, long-standing hypothesis, is that smoking cigarettes is neuroprotective. The second, recent hypothesis, is that there exists biological predisposition to PD, which also manifests in decreased stimulus seeking behavior, hence lesser likelihood to smoke or use nicotine (reverse causation). The objective of this article is to summarize the evidence available in the literature and evaluate the causality of the association between Parkinson’s disease and smoking cigarettes or nicotine ingestion. It is found that the first, directly causal hypothesis is a stronger contributor to the effect, although the reversely causal mechanism could play a role. It is found that smokeless tobacco use decreases the risk of PD stronger than smoking cigarettes does, suggesting that nicotine is more important in neuroprotection than other cigarette smoke constituents.",

      "abstract": "Humans are basically competitive. For centuries, athletes have used various substances to enhance performance, increase strength, and prolong endurance. In the early 1940s, research indicating that testosterone improved a sense of well-being, appearance, and sexual performance led to the use of anabolic steroid hormones by a select few athletes. Today, even among high school students, the use of androgenic steroid hormones is prevalent, with 1% to 2% of adolescent girls and 4% to 6% of adolescent boys having used an anabolic steroid at least once. An estimated 1 million people in the United States are current of former users of anabolic-androgenic steroid hormones, with men having a higher prevalence of use than women. Androgenic steroid use has been associated with the use of other illicit drugs, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use. Nevertheless, anabolic-androgenic steroid hormones appear to have legitimate uses in certain patients. In HIV-infected, hypogonadal men, anabolic steroid hormones optimize muscle strength and muscle mass when combined with resistance exercise. Although a large number of people have used these drugs for many years, no studies of the long-term health effects have been done. However, when taken in supraphysiologic doses, these drugs are known to cause a wide range of acute adverse effects. When used in less then supraphysiologic doses in eugonadal or hypogonadal HIV-infected patients, these drugs reverse HIV-related hypogonadism, muscle wasting, and perhaps lipodystrophy. Provided that the oral preparations are not used and patients are closely monitored, anabolic-androgenic steroid hormones offer HIV-infected patients a better quality of life and an improved sense of well-being.",

Plus qu'une simple adaptation d'un terme anglo-saxon, cela traduit une veritable revolution conceptuelle dans le domaine de la consommation des produits psychoactifs, alcool, tabac, cannabis et autres drogues illicites. Pendant longtemps, l'action medicale a ce sujet etait centree sur le produit consomme, faite de mises en garde ou d'interdits le concernant. Parler d'addiction, donc centrer la reflexion sur le comportement de consommation plus que sur le produit, remonte a la fin des annees 90, bien synthetisee dans le rapport Parquet [1]. Premiere consequence : la prevention doit etre plus globale, necessitant un reperage precoce des conduites a risque, une approche differente dans la prise en charge, incluant des reseaux multidisciplinaires et la participation de l'entourage. Deuxieme consequence : d'autres comportements ont egalement des potentialites addictives ; il est vite apparu que le concept d'addiction allait bien au-dela des comportements de consommation de « drogues », et pouvait concerner la consommation de medicaments psychotropes, certains comportements alimentaires ou d'activite physique, le dopage, les jeux de hasard... L'addiction ­ et les comportements addictifs qui en decoulent ­ apparait ainsi comme un concept porteur de larges retombees.",

Crimes with no apparent motive are more difficult, such as when a person is attacked by someone unknown to him or her. But perhaps there are clues—a hair follicle, a scrap of clothing, or an eyewit­ ness. The most difficult crimes of all are those that occur despite apparent countermotives: He had spent his life savings to protect her, so why would he have killed her? In this case, even the best detective is at a loss to explain why it happened. Treatment providers can encounter similar puzzles when trying to explain the motivation behind substance abuse. Some people, particu­ larly those in the early stages of addiction, seem to have clear motives for use. Perhaps they enjoy the pleasurable effects or use to minimize negative effects. However, people in later stages of addiction are more puzzling since they seem to use despite the effects. In fact, it’s not uncommon for persons in later-stage addiction to say that they use drugs despite the effects rather than because of them. At the same time, people may feel that they like the drug less but need it more.",

The few studies on smoking cessation in asthma confirm the efficacy of validated smoking cessation strategies in these patients (nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, bupropion, cognitive and behavioural therapies). Smoking cessation in parents with asthmatic children is essential and is based on the same strategies. Electronic cigarettes may be a useful help to quit smoking in some patients. Smoking cessation is beneficial in asthmatic smokers and associated with (1) a reduction of asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and bronchial inflammation, (2) decreased use of rescue medications and in doses of inhaled corticosteroids, (3) improved asthma control, quality of life, and lung function.In asthmatic patients, it is essential to assess smoking status and health professionals must assist them to quit smoking.",

      "title": "Energy Drink Use in Sport: All Risk, No Gain",
      "abstract": "“Deaths linked to energy drinks” has become a sad and all too frequent headline in recent years. The rise in energy drink use in the sporting world has been exponential as few products have inserted themselves into athlete's lives the way that caffeine-laden energy drinks have over the last 30 years. What began as a novel way to party through the night has become a mainstay of athletic preparation for a large portion of active adolescents and young adults who are seeking some magical performance edge. On the surface, this sounds reasonable until we consider that energy drinks have a number of crucial flaws. The simple fact is that energy drinks fail to provide their implied value for most consumers, and they contain one or multiple ingredients that may place athletes in peril for adverse outcomes, including death. It is time for the sports medicine community to take a stronger stand on the use of energy drinks if we are to be true to our mission to safeguard the health and well-being of our athletic population. Energy drinks and energy “shots” are nonalcoholic beverages typically comprised of solutions of sugar and carbohydrate, moderate to high amounts of caffeine, and a variety of other proprietary chemicals touted to have energy-giving properties. Though their marketing often focuses on these other chemicals, most notably taurine, glucuronolactone, guarana, yerba mate, and even ephedra, at their core, energy drinks are just cleverly crafted vehicles for sizable quantities of caffeine. Because the FDA considers them supplement products and not foods, energy drinks and shots are not held to the same caffeine limits used for standard beverages. This allows manufacturers to produce them with far higher caffeine concentrations than would be acceptable for soda or coffee, and this lack of regulation clearly contributes to the risk for misuse. Standard 8-oz. energy drinks contain 80 mg to 100 mg of caffeine (a large cup of coffee may contain 200+ mg) while “shots” may contain nearly 200 mg of caffeine in only 2 oz. Though product labels do accurately reflect the synthetic alkaloid caffeine content of these drinks, many of the natural additives, most notably guarana and yerba mate, are powerful natural sources of caffeine that are not included in the labeled total. The end result is a product with a far higher caffeine concentration than even the savvy consumer could reasonably determine. So is there justification for the sports world's obsession with caffeine and related stimulant products? Caffeine has long been heralded as a performance-enhancing chemical, but exercise physiology studies to date have shown caffeine to have limited to no value for sport. Moderate caffeine consumption in the range of 3 to 6 mg·kg−1 has been shown to have a positive impact on performance but only in trained athletes during sustained maximal endurance exercise. No value has been consistently proven for short-burst or power activities, resistance exercise, or with consumption of 9 mg·kg−1 or higher. This lack of proven efficacy is ironic in light of the fact that energy drink use is highly associated with the desire to “amp up” a gym workout or power lifting session where caffeine has no proven ergogenic value. They also are widely consumed in the precompetition time frame as a means of increasing energy or intensity for sport but, again, the data do not support value in those settings either. For most, caffeine intake enhances the perception of athletic prowess but fails to deliver the physiologic value to justify its use. All risk, and no gain. And the risks are substantial. Considering the widespread use of stimulant products, it is no surprise that there have been an alarming number of case reports of significant adverse reactions in association with energy drink consumption. Visits to emergency rooms and calls to poison control centers relating to excessive caffeine or stimulant intake are increasing each year. Tragically, energy drink consumption has been associated with cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, spontaneous coronary dissection, coronary vasospasm, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Other serious adverse effects have included seizures, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, acute psychosis, and high risk/aggressive behavior. These adverse events often result from a “perfect storm” of physiologic factors coming together, the foundation of which is generally an undiagnosed underlying medical condition which becomes manifest when sufficient exacerbating factors are present. In these energy drink cases, the effects of caffeine and other stimulants, coupled with the stresses of sport-elevated heart rate and blood pressure, dehydration, heat stress, and other ingested substances, especially psychostimulants — may precipitate a serious or even lethal event. It is important to note that these risks are even greater in adolescents who often have limited tolerance to caffeine due to infrequent consumption. As a result, younger athletes are more subject to complications, particularly when consuming large and rapid doses of caffeine present in energy drinks, especially in combination with exercise. Concerning trends in the use and misuse of energy drinks can be traced to the obvious appeal generated through aggressive advertising and implied claims of sport benefit. Young, impressionable athletes are inherent risk takers and are increasingly seeking whatever advantage they can gain to augment their sport performance. Energy drink consumption then becomes an accepted part of their athletic preparation because of the inaccurate sense that these products provide a physiologic boost that cannot be obtained without them. These beliefs are further fueled by clever and often deceptive marketing to this vulnerable population. Bright, colorful packaging with a variety of powerful images and enticing names lure athletes with their implied benefits of enhanced athletic performance and boundless energy. Sponsorships of prominent sports teams and major sporting events only deepen the association between energy drinks and visions of athletic success. Unfortunately, there are no safeguards in place to desensationalize these products and their purported athletic value. Products with legitimate athletic value should be safe and should stand on their physiologic properties alone; energy drinks simply do not. So, what are we as a group to do? The sports medicine community owes it to our athletes and active patients to stand up against the rampant and uncontrolled use of energy products. We must be on the front lines of efforts to change the trajectory of this societal trend. All sports medicine providers need to be vocal in our educational efforts for prudent use and to ensure that every athlete knows what the risks and benefits, if any, are from stimulant products that they may be consuming. We need to reiterate again and again that caffeine and its related stimulant chemicals have little to no value to the vast majority of athletes, but the risks extend to everyone who consumes them. Pressure must be applied to compel manufacturers to market their products in a fair and unbiased way with a focus on scientific fact rather than unfounded hype and profit motive, and they should be prevented from targeting vulnerable populations who stand to be harmed the most by energy drink use. Manufacturers also should be required to fairly represent what they know about the potentially harmful effects of their products and clearly provide point of sale information to help consumers make choices appropriate to their athletic or activity goals. The FDA should classify all energy drinks as foods, rather than supplements, so that they will be held to the same caffeine concentration standards as soda and related drinks. Finally, much research is needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy of this group of products; we have really only scratched the surface. If athletes are going to use energy drinks and related products, they need guidance in product choice, caffeine amount, prudence of use for a given athletic endeavor, and avoidance of accidental or intentional overuse. We as sports medicine providers are in a unique position to meet these needs. Our consistent message must be that athletic feats are achieved through hard work and optimal lifestyle management. Energy drinks are a hazardous shortcut that only puts athletes in harm's way. All risk, no gain.",

      "abstract": "A 61-year-old woman with a history of alcohol dependence came to the emergency department with ethanol intoxication. Her serum ethanol concentration was 322 mg/dl. When questioned, she admitted to consuming a 14-oz bottle of hairspray mixed with water because of its denatured alcohol content. The woman had used nonbeverage sources of alcohol on a regular basis for a number of years after learning of the practice from fellow attendees of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Her primary reason for this behavior was to hide her continued alcohol abuse from her family. She consumed hairspray that contained 50% denatured alcohol by volume; the amount she ingested was equal to 7 fluid oz of ethanol, the equivalent of 14 1.25-oz shots of 80-proof liquor. Her serum ethanol concentration was consistent with that predicted by pharmacokinetic equations based on the consumption of one bottle of hairspray. The hairspray product contained specially denatured alcohol 40-B, which consists of ethanol and small quantities of t-butyl alcohol and denatonium benzoate. Ethanol is the substance of primary toxicologic concern. Clinicians need to be aware that numerous nonbeverage sources of alcohol exist and should be considered when a patient presents with acute intoxication. The source and its components should be identified as soon as possible in order to assess other potential toxicities.",

      "abstract": "The efficiency of the individual organs and the body lessens with age. For instance, renal function diminishes, enzyme induction is delayed, cell membrane composition and total body salt and water contents are altered, and lean body mass is reduced. Consequently, the elderly differ from younger people in their response to drugs, for their ability to handle drugs by absorption, detoxication, and excretion is naturally effected. Not surprisingly, therefore, iatrogenic disease related to drugs is very common. Fortunately, as a rule, absorption is less affected by age than excretion and detoxication. Hence the failure of an elderly person to respond to an effective drug is nearly always due to failure of the patient to take the drug rather than to absorb it. Large loading doses of drugs are, there fore, rarely necessary and in most cases it is preferable to start with a small dose, particularly if the drug is potentially toxic and likely to be poorly excreted. This does not mean that large doses of some drugs should not be given to the elderly if indicated?for example, antibiotics in acute infec tions or diuretics in the early stages of heart failure. Never theless, in using drugs in the elderly it is wise to observe a few simple rules: (1) Know the pharmacological action of the drug being used and in particular how it is metabolized and excreted. (2) Use the lowest dose that is effective in the individual patient. Higher blood concenitrations per dose are achieved and the half life of some drugs?for example, cortisol or digoxin?is prolonged in the elderly, and this can lead to accumulation and the need for lower and less frequent dosage. Drug dose should, therefore, be titrated with patient response. (3) Use the fewest drugs the patient needs. Memory, par ticularly short-term memory, deteriorates with age; conse quently complex drug regimens may be mismanaged. (4) Do not use drugs to treat symptoms without first discovering the cause of the symptoms. These may some times be due to a social deprivation syndrome which may be better dealt with by a trained social worker. (5) Do not withhold drugs on account of old age parti cularly when drug therapy may improve the old person's quality of life. (6) Do not use a drug if the symptoms it causes are worse than those it is supposed to relieve. Hence knowledge of a drug's side effects is important and one should remember that sometimes adverse reactions may be individual to the",

E tendo como objetivos especificos investigar a porcentagem de meninas, de 13 a 15 anos, do Colegio Raymundo Carvalho que utilizam produtos que trazem danos ao cabelo e onde os aplicam; e descrever os componentes do produto, identificado como o mais utilizado atraves da enquete, o problema de pesquisa foi elaborado previamente pensando nas tais respostas: quais os possiveis danos a saude que podem ocorrer apos a aplicacao de produtos quimicos capilares sem o auxilio de um profissional? Comprovou-se que os cabelos que sofrem lesoes quimicas podem ficar quebradicos e podem ocorrer irritacoes no couro cabeludo, como pequenas feridas e queimaduras na pele; ou ainda, podem causar câncer de pulmao e pele, dependendo do quao forte for o produto. Esses problemas acontecem por varias razoes, como uso inadequado das quimicas, sensibilidade aos ativos da formula e com o uso demasiado de uma quimica no mesmo cabelo. Foi realizada uma pesquisa em sites, uma enquete com algumas meninas do Colegio Raymundo Carvalho, entrevistas com seis cabeleireiros locais e testes em mechas de cabelo, entao, a partir disso, foram feitos graficos. Apos a enquete realizada com as adolescentes, foi descoberto que 60% das meninas do Colegio Raymundo Carvalho ja aplicaram quimica no cabelo; 94% comecaram a aplicacao depois de completarem dez anos de idade, 83% das meninas aplicam os produtos com a ajuda de profissionais em saloes de beleza e apenas 18% usam chapinha ou babyliss diariamente. E com a entrevista realizada com os cabeleireiros, analisou-se que: antes da aplicacao, o ideal e saber se o cabelo ja tem quimica, se sim, que quimica que e e se a menina ja teve a primeira menstruacao. Logo, fazer prova de toque para testar se o produto nao vai causar alergia. Tambem verificou-se que de cada seis cabeleireiros entrevistados, um aprova o uso de quimica em menores e faz o uso, e dois nao aprovam, mas aplicam. Com isso, concluiu-se que, se aplicado a quimica corretamente, nao vai trazer muitos riscos a saude, apesar de, mesmo fazendo a aplicacao em saloes profissionais, e inevitavel que o cabelo sofra danos como os mencionados acima.",

      "title": "Alcohol and Cannabinoids - From the Editors",
      "abstract": "Alcohol is frequently used in association with cannabis, with co-use now perceived as normative with expanding cannabis legalization.Cannabinoid products are increasingly used for a number of medical and recreational purposes, including to enhance alcohol-reinforcing properties or in some cases to substitute for alcohol.Rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) are higher among cannabis users relative to nonusers, with approximately 60% of individuals with current cannabis use disorder also meeting criteria for current AUD. 1,2Co-use is linked with heavy and problematic alcohol consumption, which in turn increases risk of alcoholrelated diseases such as alcohol-associated liver disease.Co-use is also linked with a number of negative consequences, including behavioral risks, 3 risk for driving safety, psychiatric comorbidity, adverse health effects, and poor alcohol treatment outcomes. 4However, the impact of cannabinoids on alcohol-related morbidity is not well understood, and findings on the impact of cannabis use on alcohol-related behaviors are equivocal.Cannabis serves both to complement drinking (i.e., increasing alcohol use), leading to more harmful consequences, and to substitute for alcohol effects (i.e., decreasing alcohol use and minimizing related risks). 5Beyond simultaneous (i.e., same-session) or temporally independent (e.g., same-week) co-use patterns, the substantial variability in cannabinoid composition (i.e., tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]-to-cannabidiol ratio), formulations (e.g., smoked, edibles), and quantity of cannabis could influence the direction of effect on alcohol-related outcomes.Further, individual differences associated with age and neurodevelopment; substance use disorders; 6 motives for cannabis, alcohol, and simultaneous use; 7 and the impact of statelevel cannabis and alcohol regulatory policies 8 could contribute to mixed findings on the risks and benefits of cannabinoids in relation to alcohol-related behaviors.This research review series approaches cannabinoid-alcohol co-use through the lens of complex interactions between biological, psychological, and environmental factors.Basic science research reviewed in this topic series highlights the role of the endogenous cannabinoid or endocannabinoid (eCB) system in alcohol-related behaviors.The eCB system, which regulates cannabis reinforcement, is also involved in modulating alcohol reinforcement, motivation to consume alcohol, excessive alcohol consumption, AUD, 9-11 and alcohol-related diseases.Emerging preclinical literature implicates exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists (e.g., THC) in increased alcohol consumption, with chronic exposure to alcohol implicated in disruptions in eCB signaling. 12,13THC is the primary psychoactive constituent that interacts with the eCB system, producing intoxicating, rewarding, and reinforcing effects in a dose-dependent function.Although THC is the most commonly studied cannabinoid that defines cannabis potency, there are more than 100 other phytocannabinoids and more than 500 constituents in the cannabis plant that also may exert different effects on alcohol-related outcomes.For example, cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychoactive, plant-based cannabinoid that has been implicated in the medicinal value of",

De acordo com os estudos, o uso do cigarro eletrônico tem se popularizado entre os jovens e aumentado sua prevalência entre adultos que desejam parar de fumar. A praticidade, publicidade, sabor e por serem menos nocivos à saúde que os cigarros convencionais, são fatores que favorecem o público fumante ou de pessoas abertas a experimentação mais suscetíveis a utilizar estes produtos. Cigarros eletrônicos são altamente viciantes igual aos tradicionais e causam problemas de saúde mesmo em uso agudo e são potencialmente cancerígenos. Formaldeído, níquel, acetaldeído e nitrosaminas são as principais substâncias carcinogêneas do aparelho. A nicotina, acroleína, formaldeído, propileno glicol, cromo e níquel são os principais responsáveis pelos problemas cardiopulmonares.

The idea that alcoholism is a discrete entity has been undermined by a second major line of advance — the survey investigation of population drinking practices. In any culture where alcohol is an accepted recreational drug, dependence on alcohol is in a statistical sense a normal condition -most people will have some degree of drive toward seeking alcohol actuated by a variety of external or internal cues. Traditionally a distinction has been made between psychological dependence and physical dependence. In Anglo-Saxon literature the 'psychopathic' alcoholic is a familiar stereotype. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms are typically experienced on waking, but with the highly dependent person careful questioning may reveal that he experiences sub-acute withdrawal during the day, or indeed wakes during the night disturbed by withdrawal symptoms.",

Adult male alcoholics in treatment ( n = 30) were randomly assigned to visual and olfactory exposure either to alcohol cues or to control cues, and then were allowed to smoke while continuing visual exposure to the same cues. Exposure to alcohol cues resulted in significantly greater self‐reported urge to drink and urge to smoke but had no significant effect on the topography of smoking behavior. When variance due to urge to smoke was controlled, greater urge to drink correlated negatively with number of cigarette puffs. The results provide some support for a priming hypothesis of tobacco's role on alcoholism recovery. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.",

It is now understood that nicotine itself is not very harmful and nicotine replacement therapy products have been widely used as an aid to quit, reduce to quit or temporarily abstain from smoking for many years. The popularity of the unlicensed electronic cigarette has increased despite an unknown risk profile and sinus use in Sweden provides strong evidence in support of a harm reduction strategy. The regulatory environment around harm reduction has changed in the UK and is continuing to evolve across the globe. The need for more appealing, licensed nicotine products capable of competing with cigarettes sensorially, pharmacologically and behaviourally is considered by many to be the way forward. The significant positive impact on public health that could be gained from encouraging people to switch from cigarettes to licensed medicinal nicotine products cannot be ignored.",

      "title": "The Effect of Cannabis Compared with Alcohol on Driving",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of both alcohol and cannabis use and the high morbidity associated with motor vehicle crashes has lead to a plethora of research on the link between the two. Drunk drivers are involved in 25% of motor vehicle fatalities, and many accidents involve drivers who test positive for cannabis. Cannabis and alcohol acutely impair several driving‐related skills in a dose‐related fashion, but the effects of cannabis vary more between individuals than they do with alcohol because of tolerance, differences in smoking technique, and different absorptions of Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana. Detrimental effects of cannabis use vary in a dose‐related fashion, and are more pronounced with highly automatic driving functions than with more complex tasks that require conscious control, whereas alcohol produces an opposite pattern of impairment. Because of both this and an increased awareness that they are impaired, marijuana smokers tend to compensate effectively while driving by utilizing a variety of behavioral strategies. Combining marijuana with alcohol eliminates the ability to use such strategies effectively, however, and results in impairment even at doses which would be insignificant were they of either drug alone. Epidemiological studies have been inconclusive regarding whether cannabis use causes an increased risk of accidents; in contrast, unanimity exists that alcohol use increases crash risk. Furthermore, the risk from driving under the influence of both alcohol and cannabis is greater than the risk of driving under the influence of either alone. Future research should focus on resolving contradictions posed by previous studies, and patients who smoke cannabis should be counseled to wait several hours before driving, and avoid combining the two drugs.",

      "abstract": "There is no more despairing human being than the obsessional alcoholic condemned by a condition of mind and body to continue to drink. Despite knowing the disastrous consequences involved in drinking, time and time again the alcoholic of whatever class or station will resort to alcohol. This is often directly against the person's will and contrary to promises sincerely made. Sometimes alcoholism has a human being so much in its grip that, although the complaint may be obvious to others, the alcoholic cannot see the nature of his or her condition or the possibility of a way out. So strong is the process of denial that often alcoholics are the last to realise that drinking is a problem, if they come to this realisation at all.",

Based on “tendency to abuse alcohol” frequency, drinking was dichotomized into misuse or non-misuse and examined as a predictor of disordered eating and EDs. Sixteen (14.7%) reported alcohol misuse and had significantly higher drive for thinness, anxiety associated with specific foods, frequent dieting, feelings of guilt/shame with eating, and binge eating disorder (BED) than non-misusers. Alcohol misuse may be associated with disordered eating and BED, warranting larger studies and screening efforts.",

Det skader ikke kun de personer, som misbruger lovlige og ulovlige stoffer, men påvirker hele familien, venner og samfundet. Brug og misbrug af euforiserende stoffer er stigende i flere lande og er hvert år skyld i millioner af dødsfald, især alkoholmisbrug. Cannabis er det mest almindeligt anvendte illegale stof i hele verden, men der produceres til stadighed nye stoffer på verdensmarkedet. Litteraturen om virkningerne af illegale stoffer på den orale sundhed er relativ sparsom på grund af vanskeligheder med at rekruttere personer til denne type kliniske studier, og idet mange misbrugere simpelthen undgår besøg hos tandlægen. Der synes imidlertid at være evidens for efter at misbrug af rusmidler er forbundet med en øget risiko for at udvikle caries, tanderosion, paradentose, xerostomi, nedsat spytsekretion og bruksisme. Desuden er det velkendt, at overdreven indtagelse af alkohol øger risikoen for oral cancer betydeligt. Det er vigtigt, at tandlæger har et indgående kendskab til de kliniske manifestationer ved misbrug og de medicinske risici, der kan være ved behandling af patienter med misbrug, men også for at gøre patienterne opmærksomme på disse orale sundhedsrisici. Dette kapitel fokuserer på, hvorledes nogle af de mest almindeligt anvendte rusmidler, herunder alkohol, kan påvirke den orale sundhed.",

This opinion is part of a larger speculative web, namely, that tobacco use is genetically predetermined and that the people destined to use tobacco are the very people who are prone to have smaller babies and who are most likely to develop the sundry ills more commonly regarded as being caused by tobacco use. 1-3 Hickey's hypothesis provides an alternative explanation for the observation that people who use tobacco often feel more normal while smoking than immediately after stopping. The conventional interpretation of this phenomenon is that nicotine is a psychoactive drug that induces tolerance, and the abrupt cessation of tobacco use often precipitates a withdrawal syndrome. 4,5 As in alcohol or narcotic withdrawal, the newly abstinent person may feel ill and experience a temporary decrement in performance.

      "abstract": "The consumption of narcotics is one of the problems the international world is confronted with nowadays; its direct or indirect effects lead to the conclusion that it represents a worrying phenomenon meant to be taken into account by the international programs of co-operation. In contrast with the mature population, the younger population is much more receptive to the new, much more attracted by new experiments and, consequently, by risks. The narcotics flagellum is one of the most complex, profound and dramatic phenomena met with in the contemporary world. Narcotization is the morbid habit of repeatedly taking and using ever higher doses of more or less toxic substances able to generate a psychological and physical addiction to them. Unhappily due to the lack of information, people think that the illegal substances only – heroine, marijuana, cocaine, etc. – are considered drugs. Not long ago there appeared the so-called “mixes of ethno-botanical plants” that are perfectly legal, and many consumers have replaced narcotics - as marijuana, for example - with plant mixes. According to explanations given by the Ethno-botanical Explanatory Dictionary, ethno-biology is a branch that studies the mutual relationship between man and plant. In Romania, ethno-botanical plants are sold under the generic names of “aroma therapeutic” or “ethnobotanical” plants. The numerous researches meant to decode the molecular and biochemical structure of these herbs, the researchers found that consumers are described as facing hallucinogenic effects caused by some synthetic substances - cannabinoids - added by manufacturers.",

      "abstract": "The adolescent marijuana literature is reviewed. Studies show that the prevalence of marijuana use is generally quite low in elementary schools. In junior and senior high samples, findings vary greatly from place to place. The prevalence of use increased dramatically during the 1970s although the use patterns may have peaked already in some areas. The use of marijuana increases with age, but some evidence suggests that a slight drop-off in use occurs near the end of high school. Female use seems to be increasing more than male use. Use seems to be somewhat more prevalent in middle- and upper-middle-class homes and in broken homes. Mixed support has been found for the hypothesis that marijuana users have parents that are more permissive. Parents of marijuana users are generally characterized as being less warm and supportive, and more inclined toward the use of drugs themselves. Peer and sibling use of marijuana seem to be particularly important predictors of adolescent marijuana use. Findings on personality characteristics of marijuana users are not extensive and are somewhat contradictory. There is some evidence that users tend to be somewhat alienated, external in their locus of control, and possibly higher on anxiety. Users are also characterized by a higher value on independence vs achievement and more positive attitudes toward marijuana use. Behavioral correlates of marijuana use include greater use of alcohol and other drugs, and poorer school performance.",

      "abstract": "Introduccion: La Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS) define la adolescencia como el periodo de tiempo considerado de los 10 a los 19 anos, actualmente en Mexico residen alrededor de 12.8 millones de adolescentes entre 12 y 17 anos de edad, representando cerca de la quinta parte de la poblacion total. Es esencialmente una epoca de cambios que trae consigo enormes variaciones fisicas y emocionales, transformando al nino en adulto ya que en la adolescencia se define la personalidad, se construye la independencia y se fortalece la autoafirmacion. Uno de los principales problemas en esta etapa, es el consumo de tabaco lo que constituye un grave problema que cada vez es mayor, ya que muchos adolescentes estan comenzando a fumar desde edades cada vez mas tempranas, por presion social de los amigos, por curiosidad o por el afan de experimentar, lo que pone en riesgo su salud y su calidad de vida Objetivos: Conocer la prevalencia del consumo de tabaco en adolescentes estudiantes; conocer la edad de inicio en el consumo; detectar las posibles causas del inicio del tabaquismo; conocer la prevalencia de adolescentes fumadores pasivos; conocer la permisibilidad en la educacion que reciben los adolescentes por parte de sus progenitores; conocer la valoracion que tiene el adolescente del perjuicio que supone el tabaco; conocer la relacion de prevalencia entre padres fumadores.\n Metodologia: El estudio fue de tipo cuantitativo, descriptivo de tipo no experimental. La poblacion sujeta de estudio fueron 1122 adolescentes de 12 a 15 anos de edad estudiantes de secundaria. La informacion se obtuvo mediante la tecnica de la encuesta misma que fue adecuada para los fines de este estudio. Las encuestas se aplicaron previo consentimiento informado, asegurandose en todo momento la privacidad y anonimato de la informacion.\n Resultados: Los resultados obtenidos reflejan la prevalencia del consumo de tabaco en adolescentes de 12 a 15 anos la cual fue de 24.06%, la edad de inicio del consumo fue mas frecuente en los adolescentes de 12 anos, la causa mas frecuente que indican los adolescentes para el consumo de tabaco es la curiosidad (86.52%) lo que hace que se convierta un factor de riesgo para continuar, el 23.7% de los adolescentes no reciben informacion sobre los danos ocasionados por el tabaco, el acceso al tabaco es facil, tanto por adquisicion o por los amigos, tienen creencias erroneas lo que pueden conducir a un mayor indice de fumadores, asi mismo se encontro significancia entre el habito de fumar y el consumo de alcohol, entre los adolescentes.",

      "abstract": "Although most women report alcohol use, women generally are light drinkers. Those who drink and drink heavily are more likely to be young, white, single, to have a higher education and income, and to be employed outside the home. However, women who drink during pregnancy, and particularly, those who continue to drink through the third trimester are different. They are older, more likely to be black, and they have higher rates of illicit drug use, less education, and lower social status. Marijuana and cocaine are used less frequently. However, women of childbearing age have the highest rates of use for both these drugs. Women who use marijuana during pregnancy are more often black, unmarried, and of lower social class. Cocaine users tend to be black, older, unmarried, and also of lower socioeconomic status. Both groups more frequently use other illicit drugs and, in general, receive less prenatal care. Therefore, for alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine, the highest rates of use are found among women of childbearing age. The women most likely to use substances during pregnancy are women who also have other characteristics that are, in themselves, significant risk factors for poor pregnancy outcome. These covariates must be considered in the evaluation of the effects of prenatal substance use.",

Large losses in weight, such as those which result from extreme exercise and profuse perspiration, as in athletic contests, are easily recognized, but smaller losses or increases are not so apparent. Thus, during the day variations in body weight amounting to several pounds, directly attributable to the ingestion of food and drink and the passage of feces and urine, may not be noted because it is not the custom to record the body weight frequently throughout the day and often the appliance on which the body is weighed is not accurate enough to show changes in weight of less than 1 pound or 0.5 Kg. Such alterations in body weight are easily understood, however,",

O uso de bebidas alcoolicas e tao antigo quanto a propria humanidade. Beber moderada e esporadicamente faz parte dos habitos de diversas sociedades. Determinar o limite entre o beber social, ou o uso abusivo ou nocivo de alcool e o alcoolismo (sindrome de dependencia do alcool) sao por vezes dificil, pois esses limites sao tenues, variam de pessoa para pessoa e de cultura para cultura. O alcoolismo ou SDA (Sindrome de Dependencia do Alcool) e hoje uma das doencas com consequencias fisicas e sociais mais danosas, “que leva o individuo a desenvolver problemas biologicos, sociais ou psicologicos”. O presente artigo apresenta algumas complicacoes acerca do uso excessivo de alcool e os beneficios da atividade fisica como tratamento auxiliar, nao farmacologico, na recuperacao dos orgaos afetados pelo uso do alcool.

The phrase is, in our view, often taken to mean that you simply cannot do enough exercise to successfully lose or manage weight over time. Nonetheless, all weight loss paradigms run through energy balance,1 and the concept that you cannot outrun a bad diet is, in our view, inaccurate. Importantly, the simplicity of the phrase does not consider the multitude of other positive effects that physical activity/exercise (ie, running) have on health beyond weight loss. Evidence shows that you can out-exercise/out-work poor nutritional choices, but most people do not since they do not/will not/or cannot, practically, expend sufficient energy to do so. It is incontrovertible that exercise can and does result in weight loss.2 Nonetheless, behavioural and/or metabolic compensatory mechanisms often lessen the predicted weight loss with exercise induced as opposed to diet-induced energy deficits.2 Viewed through the lens of a weight loss approach to …",

      "abstract": "Annotation. Laxatives are drugs with different mechanism of action that are used to treat or prevent constipation. Use of laxatives to control body weight is considered a dangerous tendency, especially among young women with eating disorders. Natural or synthetic stimulant purgatives are the most commonly used for weight loss because they are cost-effective, have rapid onset of action, and available in various dosage forms. Excessive use of laxatives results in a gradual efficacy decrease causes specific damage of the gastrointestinal tract, other organs and systems. This condition is known as \"laxative abuse\". The purpose of this review is to summarize the available scientific data on behavioral characteristics, clinical and diagnostic criteria and tactics of treatment of laxative abuse with a clinical case description. Laxatives abuse should be suspected in case of eating disorders, clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histological changes in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment of laxative abuse requires gradual laxatives withdrawal, potassium replacement therapy and mandatory training in the healthy eating principles. The clinical case describes a young woman who tried to stop taking laxatives, but she started to use diuretics due to peripheral swelling. At the time of examination, the daily dose of furosemide was 600 mg (15 tablets a day). Laxative abuse is relatively common among young women and requires monitoring by physicians of various specialties.",

They need to know about changes that take place when they are active or when they are ill, and to understand the reasons why they should keep themselves clean, eat well and have regular exercise. If they feel confident with these things and comfortable with their bodies, then they will grow in self-esteem and feel good about themselves as individuals.

Consumption is mostly in beverages such as coffee, tea and some soft drinks, and smaller amounts from other foods such as chocolate. Children also consume caffeine, though in smaller amounts even relative to their smaller size. Many questions have been asked about possible health effects of caffeine and have been answered by scientific research. Studies on pregnant women consuming caffeine show no effects on the fetus, infants, or on development followed up to school age. There have been many studies on children of school age. For example, it has been shown that a single dose of 3 mg/kg is without appreciable effect on a variety of behavioral and physiological functions, and even 10 mg/kg, had only minimal effects, within the normal range of differences between the children without caffeine. While newborn infants metabolize caffeine slowly, children from less than 1 year to adolescence metabolize caffeine about twice as fast as non-smoking adults. The numerous studies showing safety of caffeine in adults, combined with the direct studies in children showing they are similar and not more susceptible to caffeine than adults, gives assurance that lifelong consumption of caffeine in foods and beverages, starting in childhood, is without deleterious effects on health.",

      "abstract": "The nightlife scene in Slovenia occupies bars, which are open until midnight or slightly longer,\r\nclubs, which open their doors at around ten o’clock and close in the early morning hours\r\n(typically at 6 a.m.), and public events, which take place outdoors or in larger venues from ten\r\no’clock until seven in the morning. The youngest partygoers, however, rarely attend organized\r\nparties due to a lack of funds. For them, it is financially more convenient to buy alcohol\r\nin stores and settle in parks or other open spaces. Although the Restrictions on the Use\r\nof Alcohol Act strictly prohibits the sale of alcohol to persons under the age of 18, minors\r\nnevertheless find ways to get their hands on alcohol, either from older peers or because the\r\ncashier simply fails to verify their age.\r\nThe party scene comes to life mainly on Fridays and Saturdays. A typical night out for youths\r\nand young adults starts out in bars or at home. Alcohol remains the drug of choice, however,\r\npartygoers tend also to spice up their evenings with marijuana and stimulants (cocaine,\r\namphetamines, ecstasy or recent synthetic drugs such as Methylone). Bars are usually the\r\nplace to meet before setting off to clubs or public events, whereas many people end up there\r\nhaving started the evening at private parties.\r\nUsually, the first arrivals to clubs and other ‘main events’ appear at midnight or later. In order\r\nto encourage crowds to show up earlier, organizers offer discount prices on tickets and\r\ndrinks until midnight. Clubs and electronic music events tend to turn on the lights somewhere\r\nbetween six and seven in the morning and from there, the party moves to an organized\r\nor private ‘after-party’.\r\nThrough outreach work, we have recently noticed an increased awareness on the part of\r\nyoung drivers of the dangers of driving under the influence. Oftentimes, a group of young\r\npeople will tell us that each week one of them makes the necessary ‘sacrifice’ and remains\r\nsober to drive the others around for the night. Two of DrogArt’s projects are devoted to alcohol-\r\nrelated harm reduction. The Choose Yourself project takes place in high schools where\r\nwe provide valuable information to youngsters on how best to plan a safe night out and on\r\nthe main risks lurking along the road to and from the party. The After Taxi project provides\r\na system of subsidizes taxis to encourage people to use public transport instead of getting\r\nbehind the wheel of their own cars or in the passenger seat with a drunk driver. The project\r\nis a fine example of a transfer of good practices as it was originally conceived and set in motion\r\nin Italy by the Etnoblog organization and later adopted in Slovenia within the scope of\r\nthe Safe Coast project.",

Las consecuencias de fumar cigarrillo van desde cambios fisiopatologicos en los sistemas respiratorio, cardiovascular y digestivo, hasta trastornos mentales asociados a la dependencia a la nicotina. Objetivo.  Realizar una revision narrativa de la literatura medica mostrando los efectos del consumo de cigarrillo sobre la salud fisica y mental en los fumadores activos y pasivos. Material y metodos.  El articulo se basa en la revision de articulos a traves de la base de datos del MEDLINE y de la biblioteca Virtual de la OMS. Se emplearon en la busqueda las palabras clave Cigarette Smoke, Cancer AND smoke, COPD AND smoke, Nicotine Dependence. Se escogieron articulos y libros publicados en idioma ingles entre los anos 1994 y 2006, realizando una lectura critica (analisis de posibles conflictos de interes y errores de diseno). Conclusion.  El humo del cigarrillo contiene particulas potencialmente peligrosas para la salud de quien esta expuesto a ellas. De este modo, fumar cigarrillo se convierte en un factor etiologico comun a muchos tipos de cancer. Ademas los componentes del cigarrillo estan relacionados con el desarrollo de otros estados patologicos (enfermedad cardiovascular y enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cronica). La nicotina, uno de sus componentes, es un potente agente adictivo. Todo esto en su conjunto hace del cigarrillo un importante problema de salud publica.",

      "abstract": "Ältere Menschen sind in hohem Ausmaß von den gesundheitlichen Folgen des Rauchens betroffen. Dennoch haben bis in die jüngste Vergangenheit Politik und Gesundheitsversorgung den älteren Rauchern wenig Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet. Dies beginnt sich zu ändern angesichts der wachsenden Zahl von alternden aktiven Rauchern im mittleren Lebensabschnitt und der wachsenden Erkenntnisse über den gesundheitlichen Nutzen der Raucherentwöhnung auch im Alter. Gleichwohl sind die Angebote für ältere Raucher häufig unzureichend. Unzutreffende Informationen und Mythen scheinen in den Überzeugungen und Einstellungen sowohl der älteren Raucher wie auch der Professionellen im Gesundheitswesen tief verwurzelt. Im Gegensatz zu diesen Mythen gilt es folgende Fakten festzuhalten: Rauchen hat keinerlei Nutzen, es verbessert weder die geistige Leistungsfähigkeit noch die Stimmung; im Gegenteil führt ein Rauchstopp auch bei gebrechlichen alten Menschen zu signifikanten Verbesserungen von gesundheitlicher Verfassung und Lebensqualität; das Rauchen von «light» Zigaretten oder die Reduzierung der Zigarettenzahl verringert nicht die Gesundheitsschäden. Es ist wichtig, über den gesundheitlichen Nutzen der Raucherentwöhnung im Alter zu informieren sowie Empfehlungen und Unterstützung für Rauchstoppversuche zu geben. In der Altersmedizin sollte der Raucherstatus aller Patienten routinemäßig festgehalten werden, Raucher sollten beim Rauchstopp beraten und medikamentös behandelt sowie weiter begleitet werden. Die Mehrheit der älteren Raucher in Deutschland möchte das Rauchen aufgeben und hat dies wiederholt erfolglos versucht. Besonders komorbide Risikopatienten, deren Zahl durch den demografischen Wandel weiter steigen wird, sind motiviert und würden besonders von einer effizienten Raucherentwöhnung profitieren. Die aktuelle Forschung zeigt, dass ein hoher Anteil ältere Raucher, insbesondere anlässlich einer stationärer Behandlung aufgrund kardiovaskulärer Erkrankungen, erfolgreich aufhören kann, wenn ihnen entsprechende Interventionen angeboten werden. Dieser Artikel gibt einen Überblick über Epidemiologie und gesundheitliche Folgen des Rauchens sowie über die Nikotinabhängigkeit und erläutert den aktuellen Stand von Forschung und Praxis der Raucherentwöhnung im Alter einschließlich möglicher Begleiteffekte wie Depression und Gewichtszunahme.",

Karena kebanyakan di masyarakat minuman keras disalahgunakan apalagi mengonsumsinya dengan dosis atau takaran yang di luar batas yang bisa mengakibatkan seseorang mabuk dan kehilangan akal sehatnya.",

Despite primary prevention and cessation-based policies and interventions, quit rates are low and nicotine replacement therapies are underused and of limited efficacy. Tobacco harm reduction has garnered attention due to tobacco policy shifts and the increasing use and marketing of such products as electronic cigarettes. Social work has been criticized as ignoring this topic, and existing literature is limited. This article considers questions and concerns surrounding tobacco harm reduction, and offers guidance in formulating a social work position regarding this important issue.",

      "abstract": "One in three adults in India uses tobacco, a highly addictive substance in one or other form. In addition to prevention of tobacco use, offering evidence-based cessation services to dependent tobacco users constitutes an important approach in addressing this serious public health problem. A combination of behavioral methods and pharmacotherapy has shown the most optimal results in tobacco dependence treatment. Among currently available pharmacological agents, drugs that preferentially act on the α4 β2-nicotinic acetyl choline receptor like varenicline and cytisine appear to have relatively better cessation outcomes. These drugs are in general well tolerated and have minimal drug interactions. The odds of quitting tobacco use are at the very least doubled with the use of partial agonists compared with placebo and the outcomes are also superior when compared to nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion. The poor availability of partial agonists and specifically the cost of varenicline, as well as the lack of safety data for cytisine has limited their use world over, particularly in developing countries. Evidence for the benefit of partial agonists is more robust for smoking rather than smokeless forms of tobacco. Although more studies are needed to demonstrate their effectiveness in different populations of tobacco users, present literature supports the use of partial agonists in addition to behavioral methods for optimal outcome in tobacco dependence.",

Pero, debido al estrechamiento de las vías respiratorias surge el asma, enfermedad caracterizada por que los receptores que revisten a los bronquios perciben sustancias específicas que contraen o relejan los músculos subyacentes y producen alteración del flujo de aire. La misma es una respuesta ante la sensibilidad anómala de los receptores colinérgicos que desencadenan una contracción en los músculos de las vías respiratorias cuando no deben hacerlo. En otras palabras, los mastocitos ubicados en los bronquios son responsables del inicio de dicha respuesta al expulsar sustancias como la histamina y leuctrienos que aumentan la secreción de moco, desplazan ciertos glóbulos blancos hacia la zona en cuestión. Asimismo, los eosinófilos presente en los pacientes asmáticos liberan sustancias adicionales que incrementan el estrechamiento de la vía respiratoria, ante estos eventos, los especialistas recomienda el uso de la vitamina D, que ofrece cierta protección contra las crisis asmáticas, reduce la exacerbación de los músculos lisos de los bronquios que causan su estrechamiento; para así, ayudar a los pacientes a realizar un menor esfuerzo para respirar; pues, las contracciones musculares de las vías respiratorias se detienen, desaparece la inflamación y estas vías respiratorias se ensanchan de nuevo, permitiendo el flujo de aire hacia dentro y hacia fuera de los pulmones y recuperan la normalidad.&nbsp; Planteamientos que apoyan el desarrollo del presente artículo ubicado en una investigación documental, apoyada en fuentes determinadas por la lectura y revisión de informaciones encontradas en documentos tecnológicos y materiales impresos, que permitieron alcanzar su propósito de analizar los efectos de la vitamina D en prevención del asma, para luego elaborar las conclusiones del mismo.&nbsp;&nbsp",

      "title": "Carbohydrate Ingestion during Exercise: Effects on Performance, Training Adaptations and Trainability of the Gut",
      "abstract": "Carbohydrate feeding has been shown to enhance endurance performance. During exercise of 2 h or more, the delivery of carbohydrates to the muscle is the crucial step and appears to be limited by intestinal absorption. It is therefore important to identify ways to overcome this limitation and study the positive and negative effects of chronic carbohydrate supplementation. There is evidence that intestinal absorption can, at least partly, be overcome by making use of multiple transportable carbohydrates. Ingestion of these carbohydrates may result in higher intestinal absorption rates and has been shown to lead to higher rates of exogenous carbohydrate oxidation which can result in better endurance performance. It also seems possible to increase the absorptive capacity of the intestine by adapting to a high-carbohydrate diet. Carbohydrate supplementation during exercise has been suggested to reduce training adaptations, but at present there is little or no evidence to support this. Despite the fact that it has long been known that carbohydrate supplementation can enhance endurance performance, there are still many unanswered questions. However, there is potential to develop strategies that enhance the delivery of carbohydrates and thereby improve endurance performance.",

The reason for such ambiguity is that the ethical evaluation of drug use is shaped by cultural beliefs and values, many of which lie hidden in commonsensical, unquestioned assumptions we make about our world.

      "abstract": "Проблема тютюнопаління є більшою та глибшою, ніж це відомо загалу. Кожні 10 секунд одна людина у світі помирає внаслідок вживання тютюну. Сила нікотинової залежності рівна героїновій та кокаїновій або більша її, набагато сильніша залежності від алкоголю, канабісу чи ЛСД та інших аналогічних наркотиків. І це не проблема лише курців, а більше проблема тих, хто їх оточує. Тому її треба вирішувати навіть не державному, а на суспільному рівні. Адже методи, які дозволяють подолати нікотинову залежність, є потрібними для нормального життя не лиш курцям, а всім людям. По суті, тютюнопалінням людство займається саме тому, що не має можливості своєчасно задовольняти свої кричущі потреби животворними методами або не знає в своїй масі про свою потребу в животворних методах. В сучасній літературі ми виокремили 5 методів подолання нікотинової залежності: просвітницький, заборонний, медикаментозний, емоційний, позитивного підкріплення. Більшість з цих популярних методів не працюють тому, що їх автори та популяризатори не замислюються над тим, що тютюнопаління задовольняє якісь кричущі потреби курця, і допоки курець не почне задовольняти ці кричущі потреби іншим, животворним способом, він не кине палити. Кричущі потреби курця, який почав палити в університеті: 1. Усунення стресу та втоми; 2. Можливість організувати свої думки в умовах понад норомованого завантаження інтелекту; 3. Отримання задоволення; 4. поглиблення спілкування. Для задоволення цих потреб методики релаксації треба викладати як першу навчальну дисципліну в середніх класах ЗЗСО до тих пір, доки не будуть отримані практичні вміння та навички. П’ятихвилинні релаксації треба застосовувати хоча б двічі за заняття, це не буде втрата академічного часу, оскільки важливо не те, скільки викладач встиг викласти за заняття, а скільки учні чи студенти встигли опанувати, а здатність сприймати напряму залежить від розслаблення. Програми перенавантажені теорією, її треба зменшувати на користь фізичної активності, яка є чудовим замінником тютюнопаління при правильній її організації. Обов’язково слід увести в програму середніх класів ЗЗСО лекцію про гормони щастя та животворні методи їх регулювання та практичні заняття, які навчать учнів це робити. І тоді питання задоволення своїх потреб руйнівними способами в молоді не стоятиме на порядку денному.",

It concentrates particularly on effects on reaction time and on skills related to car driving. The effects of alcohol on performance are very variable at low doses (under 1 g per kg body weight). The variability is due to the different measures and methods employed by the researchers and to the large interindividual and interoccasional differences in the effects of alcohol. That is, alcohol affects different people in different ways and it affects the same person differently on separate occasions. Greater performance deficits are observed as the dose increases and as the tasks become more complex. Although results vary, both nicotine and caffeine appear to antagonize the detrimental effects of alcohol on performance. Many other drugs interact with alcohol, the most important of which are sedative agents that can combine synergistically with alcohol to produce profound psychomotor and cognitive impairment. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

In addition to lung cancer, cigarette smoking is an important cause of oesophageal, oral, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers as well as pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, and cancer of the renal pelvis. With market and regulatory pressures to reduce the harms of nicotine delivery by combustion, the tobacco product landscape has changed, diversifying into many different products. E-cigarettes, also known as vapes , are battery-powered devices that simulate the sensation of smoking. Most electronic-cigarette liquids contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, and a wide variety of flavours, many of which are sweet. Sweet flavours are classified as saccharides, esters, acids, or aldehydes. The respiratory diseases and deaths associated with e-cigarettes in the United States have all been linked to the use of cannabinoids in the e-liquids.",

Subjects (4,148) were questioned about their use of benzodiazepines of whom 1,284 were also questioned about their alcohol, cigarette and caffeine consumption. Data were examined to find possible multiple substance misuse. No strong evidence could be found. People taking benozodiazepines at the time of the survey consumed significantly less alcohol than non‐users or past users. Cigarette consumption was found to be increased in current and past benzodiazepine users. Subgroups of benzodiazepine users, defined as‘high users’,‘dosage escalators’or‘chronic users’were also examined. Again no strong evidence of multiple substance misuse could be found. However, high users and dosage escalators did smoke more than others. Concurrent misuse of benzodiazepines and other legally available psychoactive substances is not common in the general population.",

Although dosing errors remain modest when using teaspoons, they may increase when using various sizes of larger spoons (3). If the size of a spoon leads a teaspoonful of liquid medicine to seem like markedly more or less than 5 mL (4), a person may compensate by under- or over-dosing (Figure).",

Research suggests that women experience addiction telescoping when they abuse alcohol, tobacco, specific stimulants, and possibly opioids. Medical side effects also develop more rapidly in women than men when they abuse many substances. Cancer and cardiac complications, specifically, pose a significant threat for women who abuse almost all types of substances. However, the physical consequences are not the only ones women suffer when they engage in substance abuse. Research on substance abuse in women ties opioids to mood and anxiety disorders, heroin to neurological deficiencies, cocaine to immune system suppression, and alcohol to intimate partner abuse. Additionally, female substance abusers, on average, have a lower level of education and lower rates of employment. In light of these gender-specific concerns, physicians should give particular consideration to detecting substance abuse in women.",

The tobacco plant has a thick, hairy stem and large, simple leaves which are oval in shape. The tobacco plant produces white, cream, pink or red flowers which grow in large clusters, are tubular in appearance and can reach 3.5-5.5 cm (1,25-2 in) in length. Tobacco may reach 1.2-1.8 m (4-6 ft) in height, Tobacco is one of the most widely abused substances in the world. It is highly addictive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that tobacco causes 6 million deaths per year. This makes tobacco the leading cause of preventable death, Nicotine is the main addictive chemical in tobacco. It causes a rush of adrenaline when absorbed in the bloodstream or inhaled via cigarette smoke. Nicotine also triggers an increase in dopamine. This is sometimes referred to as the brain’s “happy” chemical. \r\n\r\nObjectives: The main goal of this expert system is to get the appropriate diagnosis of disease. \r\n\r\nMethods: In this paper the design of the proposed Expert System which was produced to help Doctor in diagnosing many of the tobacco diseases such as: Damping off, Frog eye leaf spot, Leaf blight / black shank, Anthracnose, Sore shin, Fusarium wilt, Brown spot, Tobacco mosaic disease, Tobacco ring spot disease, Cucumber mosaic disease, Tobacco leaf curl disease. The proposed expert system presents an overview about tobacco diseases are given, the cause of diseases are outlined.

      "title": "E-cigarettes for tobacco cessation",
      "abstract": "NPs practicing in primary care frequently encounter patients who use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), some for the purpose of tobacco cessation. Research shows that clinician involvement in tobacco cessation increases the likelihood of success, and the desire to quit appears to be the strongest predictive factor for successful cessation.1,2 Patients seeking evidence-based assistance regarding tobacco cessation, such as nicotine replacement or cessation medication, are two to three times more likely to quit than those who do not.3 Despite the common belief that ENDS products, which include e-cigarettes, tank systems, and other vaping devices, are suitable for tobacco cessation, they are not recommended for this purpose because of health risks and lack of FDA approval, among other reasons. NPs can positively impact their patients' ability to achieve cessation from smoking and other tobacco products without the use of ENDS, and many resources are available to aid them in this process. It has been known since at least 1988 that nicotine is the addictive substance in tobacco.4 Nicotine reaches the brain within seconds of taking a puff and increases the release of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, that regulate mood and behavior.5 Dopamine is released in the reward center of the brain, resulting in improved mood and pleasant feelings. Over time, neuronal changes occur; thus, nicotine addiction is a chronic neurologic disorder frequently requiring treatment to overcome.6 When ENDS were introduced, it was speculated that the devices could be a powerful tool for tobacco cessation by providing a safer alternative to cigarettes, with the allure of a smoking-like behavior replacement. The liquid used with ENDS, sometimes referred to as e-liquid, produces a harmful aerosol when heated that is inhaled by users and involuntarily inhaled by nonusers.3,7,8 E-liquids usually contain nicotine, and more than half of the people who start using ENDS for tobacco cessation transfer their nicotine dependence to ENDS, often becoming dual users.3,9,10 ENDS use among adolescents is associated with increased initiation of cigarette smoking and increased frequency and intensity of both regular cigarette and e-cigarette usage.11 ENDS product use among adolescents leads to increased dependence on nicotine products.10 After years of market availability, three separate clinical guidelines recommend against the use of ENDs for tobacco cessation because of quality control concerns, insufficient data to demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the risks, and the availability of effective cessation tools. This article examines why ENDS products are not an effective, safe, or approved means of cessation for either adults or adolescents. ENDS products Youth cigarette usage has been steadily declining in recent years, but tobacco use rates remain stubbornly fixed at approximately 20% because noncigarette forms of tobacco, primarily ENDs, are increasingly used by adolescents and young adults.12 In 2020, 19.6% of high-school students in the US reported using ENDS, along with 4.7% of middle-school students.12,13 With 8.2% and 2.8% of high-school and middle-school students, respectively, reporting use of multiple tobacco products, it is clear that many youth are becoming addicted to nicotine by starting with ENDS use alone.13 Nonetheless, polytobacco use (using more than one tobacco product) is increasingly common as the market popularity of ENDS products has increased. Polytobacco users are more likely to report dependence, elucidated as early-morning cravings.12 Notably, attempts to quit among polytobacco users have been higher than cigarette-only users, suggesting that e-cigarette users are employing e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.14 The FDA regulates ENDS.15 However, ENDS products are not FDA-approved for smoking cessation. There are several FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) for this purpose, including three that are available over the counter (nicotine patches [Nicoderm CQ, Habitrol, and generic versions], nicotine lozenges [Nicorette and generic versions], and nicotine gum [Nicorette and generic versions]), and four by prescription, including two nonnicotine oral drugs (bupropion [Zyban] and varenicline [Chantix]), a nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS), and nicotine inhalers (Nicotrol). Nicotine replacement dosage calculation is based on the patient's specific nicotine consumption, such as the number of cigarettes smoked and/or time to first morning cigarette, to ensure minimal withdrawal during the cessation process. Thus, there are ample well-tested FDA-approved products available for cessation. Quality control concerns At this time, there is no legally required quality control of ENDS products; therefore, these products are manufactured without FDA oversight of quality, according to D. Jenson, Lead Senior Staff Attorney for Federal Regulation, Public Health Law Center, Mitchell Hamline School of Law (e-mail communication, December 18, 2020). Three important quality control issues are highlighted, including inaccuracy of nicotine content, compounding-in-shop (CIS) processes of e-liquids, and FDA involvement. Inaccurate nicotine content. The American E-Liquid Manufacturing Standards Association (AEMSA) states that the nicotine content of all products containing e-liquids must be within 10% of the labeled amount.16 Almost half of the studies in a systematic review of e-liquid nicotine content found inaccurate nicotine labeling of ENDS products, with some samples varying more than 100% from the label.17-21 - ENDS use-associated risks ENDS factors compromising cessation efforts Lack of proven tobacco cessation efficacy Inability to accurately dose nicotine for tobacco cessation (risk of nicotine withdrawal and/or nicotine-related adverse reactions) Lack of quality control oversight Inaccurate nicotine content Inconsistencies of in-shop compounding and labeling Direct risks of ENDS use Youth exposure to nicotine Unknown safety of inhaling e-liquid additives Risk of acute e-liquid nicotine poisoning E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury Device battery fires/explosions The authors' 2019 study supports these findings, with only 3.8% of the 238 e-liquid samples meeting AEMSA guidelines.18,22 This cross-sectional study replicated and expanded on the authors' 2015 study assessing free-base, nicotine salt (salt), and 0-mg nicotine e-liquids from a variety of North Dakota shop types to determine nicotine content accuracy.22 The authors also examined the nicotine content of CIS samples. The CIS definition was adapted from Ribisl and colleagues and was specified as either an e-liquid made entirely on site or a premade liquid to which the shop staff added extra nicotine.23 Discrete data collection was completed in 35 (92.1%) of the shops meeting the criteria. Shop types were categorized as vape shops (n = 16, 45.7%), head shops with vaping products (n = 10, 28.6%), tobacco shops (n = 6, 17.1%), and other shops (n = 3, 8.6%). This study used discreet sampling methods so as to not alter the behavior of people in public places, such as the manager, workers, and patrons; therefore, data collectors acted as normal paying customers. Of the e-liquids (n = 285) purchased, 164 (57.5%) were free-base, 80 (28.1%) were salts, and 41 (14.4%) were identified as not containing any nicotine. The mean actual nicotine content was 34% below the labeled content, ranging from 93% below to 213% above the indicated content.22 None of the 25 CIS samples met the AEMSA guideline. In one shop, six samples were not labeled for nicotine content. When asked, the shop staff stated that all six contained the same nicotine content. However, the actual content ranged from just under 6 mg/mL to almost 20 mg/mL. CIS processes. CIS processes were observed during our 2019 study.22 CIS ingredients included nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals. Vape shop staff used imprecise methods in compounding e-liquids, including visually estimating quantities of ingredients added. In one-third (two of six) of the shops where CIS processes were observed, shop staff did not relabel the nicotine content of the liquids. In one case, the nicotine content was increased from 0 mg/mL to 12 mg/mL without relabeling the bottle. Other labeling concerns included e-liquids sold without any labels, past their labeled expiration dates, and without an ingredient list.24 Another unprofessional practice included one shop being adjacent to a fish breeding room. Because of the inconsistencies in compounding and labeling, users cannot assume accuracy of e-liquid nicotine content. This has implications for individuals who are using e-liquids for cessation. Exposure to higher nicotine levels increases addiction risk. E-liquids with nicotine content lower than labeled may cause withdrawal symptoms. These are not concerns when using FDA-approved cessation products under the care of an NP. FDA involvement. The FDA requires ENDS manufacturers to file a premarket application; it is illegal to market these products without premarket authorization.25 However, most ENDS products have not been authorized by the FDA. It is of concern that given the overwhelming number of products available, the FDA states that they are unable \"to take enforcement action against every illegally marketed tobacco product.\"25 The FDA does not perform quality testing of e-cigarettes (D. Jenson, e-mail communication, May 11, 2021). Additionally, if there are no drug claims (such as for tobacco cessation), then there are neither specific quality standards or regulations for the manufacturing processes of e-cigarettes, nor for the end product (D. Jenson, e-mail communication, May 11, 2021). No e-cigarette or similar product has been approved as a drug product; therefore, no e-cigarettes are affected by the requirements that apply to FDA-regulated drugs (D. Jenson, e-mail communication, May 11, 2021). Concerns related to using e-liquids and ENDS for quitting tobacco use E-cigarette use is a particularly compelling nicotine option for cigarette users because it mimics both the physiologic satisfaction of a nicotine craving as well as the psychologic satisfaction of the act of smoking and responding to external cues that lead to smoking (time of day, social situations, behavioral triggers). The sensory and physical stimuli associated with cigarette smoking are deeply embedded aspects of smoking enjoyment and dependence (hand-to-mouth action, deep inhale/exhale, visual cues, throat hit, and tobacco flavor). The close imitation to cigarette smoking is one reason that cigarette users struggle with e-cigarette cessation, even when their original intention is to use e-cigarettes to stop all tobacco use.26 ENDS have been found to carry several health risks (see ENDS use-associated risks). Perhaps most concerning is the finding of e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) that emerged in 2019.27 EVALI is an acute pulmonary illness that has been associated with ENDS use, which can be severe and life-threatening, and is characterized by bilateral infiltrates on radiologic imaging.27 It has been shown that the e-liquid additive vitamin E acetate is strongly linked to EVALI.28 Additional ENDS-related health risks include the lack of safety data associated with inhaling many of the e-liquid additives, defective device batteries causing fires and explosions, and acute nicotine poisoning related to ingestion, inhalation, and topical absorption of e-liquids.29 Clinical guidelines relating to ENDS Nicotine users often ask whether ENDS are safe and effective and whether they can be used for cessation from traditional tobacco products. Many worldwide studies have attempted to answer that question. However, NPs and other clinicians face difficulties when interpreting such studies. First, ENDS products are not actively regulated; specific product analysis included in one study cannot be generalized to other products because of differences in the ENDS product devices as well as the liquid ingredients. Secondly, as mentioned, research shows that the actual nicotine content in ENDS products can vary, sometimes significantly, from their label.17,22 Finally, the puff patterns of ENDS users (how much of and how fast each puff is inhaled) are often not standardized in clinical trials, leading to wide variability of ENDS use, making comparisons difficult. Some clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have tried to summarize all the studies to determine whether NPs can recommend ENDS products for tobacco cessation, which are described below. In 2018, the American College of Cardiology's Decision Pathway on tobacco cessation treatment recommended that \"given the uncertainties of the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on health, a clinician should advise cigarette smokers seeking to quit to use evidence-based, FDA-approved, safe, and effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies as first-line treatments in preference to e-cigarettes.\"30 However, the document notes that some patients will choose to use ENDS products even if FDA-approved treatments are recommended. In those cases, the clinician should support the patient's effort to modify tobacco use and recommend use of ENDS products in the safest way possible (for example, avoid dual use of ENDS and cigarettes, ensure child-proof packaging and avoid using around children, and follow device instructions to minimize risk of explosion), with the goal of quitting both tobacco and ENDS products. In 2020, the American Thoracic Society's CPG for medication treatment in adults who use tobacco recommended that varenicline is a preferred treatment option over ENDS products.31 Studies evaluated in this CPG comparing varenicline with ENDS products showed that the benefit of varenicline over ENDS was uncertain; however, varenicline had fewer adverse reactions than ENDS products. Additional studies comparing varenicline with ENDS are needed to increase confidence in the recommendation. In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) stated that \"evidence on the use of e-cigarettes for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons, is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.\"32 The USPSTF recommends that clinicians direct nonpregnant patients to FDA-approved pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation.32 Clinicians are advised to direct pregnant persons to behavioral interventions. NPs should be aware of the many risks associated with ENDS products as well as the lack of evidence supporting the use of ENDS as a cessation method. Avoidance of ENDS products should be recommended; however, when that is not possible, approaching ENDS products in the same manner as other tobacco products would support patients' attempts to achieve both tobacco cessation and ENDS abstinence. Conclusion The science is still developing on the short- and long-term effects of ENDS on health and tobacco cessation efforts. Quality control of ENDS products is lacking. The actual nicotine content in ENDS products is often unknown, making it difficult to calculate the risk of replacing cigarettes with ENDS while ensuring equivalent levels of nicotine. Conversely, FDA-approved treatment medications are safe, effective, and have well-established dosing aimed at minimizing nicotine withdrawal and maximizing cessation success. Currently, there are no healthcare provider guidelines that recommend ENDS as a safe or effective means for cessation. The authors concur with current science-based guidelines that ENDS use for tobacco cessation is not recommended. NPs can instead recommend the cessation products approved by the FDA.",

      "abstract": "A ascensão dos cigarros eletrônicos, ou vaping, é notável, sendo vistos por muitos como uma alternativa menos prejudicial ao tabagismo convencional. No entanto, preocupações surgem sobre os efeitos adversos desses dispositivos no sistema respiratório. Esta revisão investiga o impacto dos cigarros eletrônicos na função pulmonar e na saúde respiratória. Com base em evidências científicas, este artigo avaliar os efeitos do vaping no sistema respiratório, focando em patologias pulmonares e alterações funcionais resultantes desse hábito. Foi realizada uma revisão narrativa da literatura em bases de dados como PubMed, Scopus e Web of Science, incluindo pesquisas sobre os impactos respiratórios do vaping. A busca abrangeu artigos em inglês, espanhol e português. Os resultados indicam uma correlação significativa entre o uso de cigarros eletrônicos e sintomas respiratórios adversos, como tosse, sibilância e dificuldade respiratória. Estudos longitudinais sugerem que o vaping pode contribuir para o declínio da função pulmonar e para o desenvolvimento de doenças respiratórias crônicas, como bronquite e pneumonite. Substâncias tóxicas presentes nos aerossóis desses dispositivos podem induzir inflamação pulmonar e dano alveolar. Apesar dessas constatações, há necessidade urgente de mais estudos que explorem os mecanismos subjacentes e avaliem o impacto a longo prazo do uso contínuo de cigarros eletrônicos. A revisão destaca a importância de regulamentações rigorosas e campanhas educativas para conscientizar sobre os riscos do vaping, especialmente na proteção de jovens e populações vulneráveis. Somente com uma compreensão mais profunda dos efeitos dos cigarros eletrônicos será possível desenvolver políticas de saúde pública eficazes e garantir a proteção respiratória da população.",

Approximately one-third of Americans have tried the substance at least once. Despite its popularity, few people smoke marijuana regularly. Less than 5% of Americans report using the drug every week. Estimating the number of users is difficult because people lie or forget about their use. The amounts that people consume are also hard to estimate. A variety of definitions of misuse of the drug exist that include addiction, dependence, abuse, and problems. Addiction does not have a universal definition, making the term difficult to use scientifically. Abuse and dependence are diagnosed reliably and can clearly apply to problem marijuana users. Nevertheless, the abuse and dependence diagnoses may not provide the clear information one might learn from a simple list of marijuana problems.",

      "title": "Author's reply to: Smoking at diagnosis and survival in cancer patients",
      "abstract": "Mfoumou et al. raise several excellent points. Cigarettes are predominant form of tobacco consumption in the world accounting for over 95% of total tobacco consumption. Numerous compounds in tobacco smoke can lead to the development and progression of cancer.1 Nicotine and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) are important contributors to the effects of tobacco on tumor progression.2 Nicotine and activation of nAChRs can increase tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and epithelial–mesenchymal transition.3-5 Nicotine decreases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in vitro and in vivo.6, 7 As discussed by Mfoumou et al., water pipe smoke (also referred to as a “hookah”) contains a significant number of similar toxic compounds as cigarette smoke. Even a single use of water pipe smoke can result in significant increases in carbon monoxide, nicotine and tobacco specific nitrosamines,8 also known to activate nAChRs.3 Although current evidence demonstrates that tobacco use is detrimental to cancer treatment outcome, more objective assessments of tobacco use would substantially increase the depth of our understanding of the relationship between tobacco and cancer progression.9 Unfortunately, the assessment of tobacco use and tobacco cessation in ongoing clinical trials is substantially deficient.10 As a result, considerable work remains to accurately assess the true effect of tobacco on cancer progression. Additional studies are certainly needed to assess the role of tobacco, especially combustible forms of tobacco, on cancer progression. We concur with Mfoumou et al. that this deficiency needs to be addressed with biologic studies and in ongoing cancer clinical trials. Yours sincerely, Graham W. Warren Mary E. Reid K.

Most of these suffer hayfever, which is a form of allergic rhinitis, or asthma. Many allergens (i.e. antigens that cause allergies in hypersensitive people) have been isolated and described in detail. These allergens are generally antigens derived from plant or fungal proteins. However, allergy to cats is the most common allergic condition world-wide, followed by allergy to house mite dust. All babies are capable of being allergic to foods and inhaled allergens, since their immune system is just developing the ability to react in an adult manner. Generally they only receive breast milk or formula feed for several months so the reactions are not common but, if foods are not introduced slowly enough, babies up to about nine months to one year of age can show allergic responses. Then the body learns to tolerate, or not react to, the potentially allergenic substances and the baby can eat a mixed diet without reactions. About 2–5% of adults remain allergic to foods such as cow's milk, peanuts or seafoods, and about 5–10% of children may suffer asthma, with the numbers rising each year. One-third of these may grow out of asthma, but another 10% of adults are newly added to the list of sufferers. The cost of asthma to the American economy in 1990 alone was around $3.6 billion.",

The biochemical mechanisms underlying the effects of food restriction are not well understood and in any case they are complicated by factors such as rat strain, effects on the animal of confinement, lack of exercise and exposure to other stresses encountered in the unnatural surroundings of the laboratory.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of marijuana use disorder has increased among marijuana users. Marijuana is an illicit drug that is becoming commonly used among youths and young adults and is detrimental to the human health. This review addresses the questions that most people have about the use and the effects of marijuana on the human health. The review focuses on the effects and its seriousness, affecting physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral changes to the human existence. Most of the findings in this review were based upon studies done recently in the United States of America. This review shows that that the most commonly used illicit drug (marijuana) contains an active chemical called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which causes the mind-altering effects. When marijuana is smoked, its active ingredient, THC, travels throughout the body, including the brain, to produce its many effects. THC attaches to sites called cannabinoid receptors on nerve cells in the brain, affecting the way those cells function. The questions addressed include: \"Is there treatments for marijuana abusers?\"; and \"Can marijuana be used as some forms of medication to human?\".",

      "title": "Physical activity, hydration and health.",
      "abstract": "Since the beginning of mankind, man has sought ways to promote and preserve health as well as to prevent disease. Hydration, physical activity and exercise are key factors for enhancing human health. However, either a little dose of them or an excess can be harmful for health maintenance at any age. Water is an essential nutrient for human body and a major key to survival has been to prevent dehydration. However, there is still a general controversy regarding the necessary amount to drink water or other beverages to properly get an adequate level of hydration. In addition, up to now the tools used to measure hydration are controversial. To this end, there are several important groups of variables to take into account such as water balance, hydration biomarkers and total body water. A combination of methods will be the most preferred tool to find out any risk or situation of dehydration at any age range. On the other hand, physical activity and exercise are being demonstrated to promote health, avoiding or reducing health problems, vascular and inflammatory disea ses and helping weight management. Therefore, physical activity is also being used as a pill within a therapy to promote health and reduce risk diseases, but as in the case of drugs, dose, intensity, frequency, duration and precautions have to be evaluated and taken into account in order to get the maximum effectiveness and success of a treatment. On the other hand, sedentariness is the opposite concept to physical activity that has been recently recognized as an important factor of lifestyle involved in the obesogenic environment and consequently in the risk of the non-communicable diseases. In view of the literature consulted and taking into account the expertise of the authors, in this review a Decalogue of global recommendations is included to achieve an adequate hydration and physical activity status to avoid overweight/obesity consequences. Desde los comienzos del género humano, el hombre ha buscado el modo de promover y preservar la salud, así como prevenir la enfermedad. La hidratación, la actividad física y el ejercicio son factores clave para mejorar la salud. Sin embargo, estos factores en dosis excesivamente bajas o en exceso pueden ser perjudiciales para el mantenimiento de la salud a cualquier edad. El agua es un nutriente esencial para el organismo y un factor clave para la supervivencia y la prevención de la deshidratación. Sin embargo, hay todavía una controversia general en cuanto a la cantidad necesaria de ingesta de agua u otros líquidos con objeto de conseguir un nivel adecuado de hidratación. Además, hasta la fecha no hay consenso sobre las herramientas a utilizar para medir la hidratación. Con este fin, hay varios grupos importantes de variables a tener en cuenta, como el equilibrio de agua, biomarcadores de hidratación y el agua total corporal. Se prefiere en general una combinación de métodos para evaluar riesgo de situaciones de deshidratación en cualquier franja etaria. Por otro lado, se ha demostrado que la actividad física y el ejercicio promueven la salud, evitando o reduciendo la susceptibilidad a enfermedades de tipo vascular o inflamatorio, así como para ayudar en el manejo del peso. Por todo ello, la actividad física está siendo utilizada también a modo de “píldora” en terapias para promover la salud y reducir el riesgo de enfermedad. Como en el caso de los medicamentos, hay que evaluar la dosis, intensidad, frecuencia, duración y tener en cuenta las precauciones necesarias para conseguir la máxima eficacia y el mayor éxito del tratamiento. Por el contrario, el sedentarismo es el concepto opuesto a la actividad física y se ha reconocido recientemente como un factor importante de estilo de vida implicado en el ámbito obesogénico y en consecuencia en el riesgo de las enfermedades no transmisibles. Teniendo en cuenta la bibliografía consultada y la experiencia de los autores, en esta revisión se concluye con unas recomendaciones a modo de decálogo dirigido a la población general para conseguir un estatus de hidratación y actividad física adecuados con el fin de evitar las consecuencias del sobrepeso y la obesidad.",

They typically contain carbohydrate, caffeine, and other nutrients purported to enhance mental and/or physical performance. Additionally, several caffeine-containing pre-workout supplements have been developed which are commonly consumed as a drink prior to and/or during exercise. While occasional ingestion of these types of products appears to be safe and may offer some ergogenic benefit, individuals who consume these products indiscriminately need to be careful and consider how ingestion of these products may affect the total daily intake of caffeine and other stimulants throughout the day, to minimize any adverse events and/or harmful side effects. This review provides an update as to the current literature on energy drinks and energy shots and provides practical recommendations for their appropriate use among athletes.

Oropharyngeal cancer and erosive effects on the oral structures are known hazards, but the long-term total-body effects have yet to be determined. Physicians need to identify patients who use smokeless tobacco so that intervention strategies can be employed.

      "title": "Effects of exercise on appetite control: implications for energy balance",
      "abstract": "At a time of increased obesity, decreased physical activity, and high food consumption, the relationship between physical activity and appetite control needs to be examined. Many people believe that the energy expended as a result of physical activity generates a drive to eat. However, a counterintuitive conclusion arises since there is no compelling evidence that increased physical activity increases energy intake. A suppression of hunger occurs following intense exercise; however, this effect is brief and has no influence on energy intake. Indeed, there does not appear to be any within-day effect of exercise on energy intake. Day-to-day effects of exercise on energy intake could occur, but only a few provocative data exist showing a delayed effect of exercise on energy intake 2 d later. Therefore, there appears to be only a weak short-term coupling between energy expenditure and energy intake. What about the effects of increased physical activity on food selection? The natural hypothesis would be that the energy reserves used during exercise would estimate a drive for a particular nutrient. There is no clear consistent evidence to indicate that in the short-term, exercise induces changes in food or nutrient preferences. In the long-term there is some evidence that physical activity is associated with an increase in carbohydrate intake, but it is uncertain whether these changes are biologically driven for a result of changes of a psychological nature. Contrary to a popularly held view, food selection and nutrient intake constitute patterns of behavior held in place by environmental contingencies and short-acting post-ingestive physiological responses; these patterns of behavior are relatively immune to modulation by the metabolic effects of exercise.",

Un sevrage a une substance illicite peut tres difficilement etre mene a bien sans l'aide de professionnel. Au niveau du traitement, beaucoup de recherches sont en cours. En effet, si les traitements de substitution aux opiaces utilises lors du sevrage a l'heroine ont fait leurs preuves, aucune molecule n'a obtenu l'Autorisation de Mise sur le Marche pour le sevrage au cannabis, aux amphetamines ou a la cocaine. Au-dela des medicaments, une partie importante dans l'arret de la consommation est la prise en charge psychologique des usagers ainsi qu'une etude globale des problemes existant avant la dependance. De nombreux etablissements, structures, et associations existent pour permettre une prise en charge optimale du sevrage. De plus, depuis une vingtaine d'annees, des reseaux de professionnels de sante ont fait leur apparition et permettent une prise en charge pluridisciplinaire. Ces reseaux font de la prise en charge en milieu libre et en milieu carceral ou on remarque un retard assez inquietant de la prise en charge de la toxicomanie. Le role du pharmacien d'officine est fondamental dans le sevrage mais aussi dans la reduction des risques lies a la consommation de drogues par voie injectable et nasale. L'ouverture de salles de consommation a faible risque est egalement dans cette optique de reduction des risques mais a ete retardee en France.",

      "abstract": "O uso de drogas por estudantes de medicina é bastante comum, pois, pensando num contexto de pressão e pertencimento social, os alunos buscam através das substâncias uma forma de inserção social e de fuga de um cenário estressante. Devido a isso, o uso de substâncias deve ser alvo de estudo. O objetivo do estudo, portanto, é analisar o uso de drogas por estudantes de Medicina do Centro Universitário São Camilo, para levantar dados sobre a mudança do padrão de consumo, frequência e motivos para o uso. Para isso, foi feita uma pesquisa quantitativa por meio de um questionário de autopreenchimento via internet. Os resultados foram prevalência de uso de álcool, tabaco e maconha pelos estudantes, sendo o álcool a droga mais utilizada antes contexto universitário. Após entrar na faculdade, o lança-perfume e o metilenodioximetanfetamina (MDMA/ MD) ganham destaque nas substâncias mais utilizadas pela primeira vez na vida do estudante. A maioria dos estudantes afirma que a faculdade teve papel importante no aumento do consumo das substâncias. Deste modo, o tema o uso de drogas por estudantes de medicina deve ser estudado, para que seja possível compreender suas causas e pensar em estratégias de prevenção e de redução de danos.",

Because the dieting manipulated in these experiments may be unrepresentative of real-world weight-loss dieting, 122 intermittent dieters were randomized to either diet as they usually do for weight loss or eat as they do when not dieting for four weeks to provide a more ecologically valid experimental test of these effects. Results indicated that individuals in the diet as usual condition slowed the weight gain trajectory shown by non-dieting participants, but did not result in significant weight loss. These findings imply that most dieters may simply be curbing a general tendency to overeat when attempting to diet, and that dieters may be eating less than they desire rather than reducing their intake sufficiently to",

      "abstract": "Resumen €€€€€€ Antecedentes €La historia de las adicciones va unida a la historia del hombre. Fumar cigarrillos, beber alcohol, mascar hojas de coca, esnifar preparados psicoactivos, beber pocimas, fumar marihuana, utilizar el opio para el dolor, etc., son ejemplos bien conocidos de algunas de las sustancias que el hombre la utilizado a lo largo de la historia o sigue utilizando. Mas actualmente, junto a las anteriores, y sus derivados industriales o quimicos, destacan las nuevas adicciones, unas derivadas de sustancias, como es el caso de la heroina, la cocaina, las drogas de diseno, el LSD, entre las mas importantes, y otras adicciones comportamentales, sin sustancia, como resultado de nuestra sociedad tecnologica, como la adiccion a Internet, al juego de azar, al telefono movil, a los telefonos eroticos, al sexo, a las compras, y a un amplio etcetera de conductas que pueden llegar a ser adictivas (Becona, 1998b).€Por ello, en los ultimos anos se incluyen distintas conductas bajo la denominacion generica de adicciones o conductas adictivas. Basadas inicialmente en el concepto de dependencia (fisica y psiquica), y evolucionando a partir del mismo, se aplicaban inicialmente a sustancias psicoactivas que ingeridas por un individuo tenian la potencialidad de producir dependencia. Con el transcurrir de los anos se observo que tambien existian conductas, que sin haber sustancia de por medio, tenian la capacidad de producir dependencia y el resto de las caracteristicas que tenian las dependencias a las sustancias psicoactivas.€Una caracteristica central a las conductas adictivas, es la perdida de control. La persona con una conducta adictiva no tiene control sobre esa conducta, aparte de que la misma le produce dependencia, tolerancia, sindrome de abstinencia y una incidencia negativa muy importante en su vida, que va a ser en muchos casos la causa de que acuda en busca de tratamiento o le fuerzen a buscarlo. Gossop (1989) definio como elementos caracteristicos de una adiccion: 1) un fuerte deseo o un sentimiento de compulsion para llevar a cabo la conducta particular (especialmente cuando la oportunidad de llevar a cabo tal conducta no esta disponible); 2) la capacidad deteriorada para controlar la conducta (especialmente, en terminos de controlar su comienzo, mantenimiento o nivel en el que ocurre); 3) malestar y estado de animo alterado cuando la conducta es impedida o la deja de hacer; y 4) persistir en la conducta a pesar de la clara evidencia de que le esta produciendo graves consecuencias al individuo. En la misma linea, Echeburua (1999) considera como caracteristicas principales de las conductas adictivas la perdida de control, la fuerte dependencia psicologica, la perdida de interes por otras actividades gratificantes y la interferencia grave en la vida cotidiana.€Si tuviesemos que hablar de diferencias entre las adicciones del pasado y las actuales, nosotros consideramos que hay tres diferencias fundamentales entre unas y otras.

      "abstract": "O alcoolismo entre os militares passou a ser objeto de atenção especial na Marinha do Brasil a partir da criação do Centro de Dependência Química em 1997. Este estudo se desenvolveu a partir do método etnográfico, através da observação participante em 2010, no decorrer de 24 sessões, em dois grupos terapêuticos, cada qual composto por cerca de dez integrantes. Os registros foram feitos em um diário de campo após as sessões grupais. Os resultados apontaram que existe uma importante influência de fatores socioculturais na produção de seu alcoolismo. Constatou-se que o beber a bordo é uma tradição aprendida, considerando que existem: oportunidades de beber e o fácil acesso a bebidas alcoólicas; normas favoráveis que apoiam o consumo, inclusive no ambiente de trabalho; e tradições navais que, de forma contínua e sutil, difundem crenças e mitos sobre a inquestionável presença do álcool na vida naval. Enfim, a Marinha brasileira tem um posicionamento ambivalente que, de forma alternada, estimula e proíbe o consumo de etílicos a bordo, aplicando medidas administrativas e punitivas, sem critérios claros. Com efeito, modos de consumir bebidas, geralmente em grupo, encontram-se associados à execução das tarefas marinheiras, facilitando a produção da dependência do álcool.",

A critical review of the literature supports the doctrine that anabolic-androgenic steroids can improve muscular performance if certain criteria are met, but some of the health risks associated with their use may be irreversible, and life-threatening. Furthermore, polydrug abuse, restrictive diets, and dehydrating practices may potentiate the health risks associated with weight training and steroid use. Recent investigations of nutritional and training alternatives to anabolic-androgenic steroids are promising. To help lure athletes from drug abuse, the pursuit of new areas of research and education should be priorities in the campaign against the abuse of anabolic steroids.",

In older patients, in whom liver and other organ functions may be reduced, even modest social drinking will impair cognitive abilities. Alcoholism is especially detrimental to older persons because 1) their blood levels of ethanol are higher than those in younger persons, and brain neurons may be more sensitive to the drug; 2) ethanol can disturb their sleep and sexual performance; 3) their cognitive functions may be significantly impaired by ethanol; and 4) for elderly patients, who commonly take a variety of drugs, ethanol and drug interactions are particularly hazardous.",

      "title": "Взгляд Ибн Сино о проведении опорожнения",
      "abstract": "Ибн Сина упоминал методы очищения организма много лет назад. Его также использовали в современной медицине. К сожалению, в последнее время этот метод используется редко. Что же касается умеренного задержания и опорожнения то они полезны и сохраняют тело в здоровом состоянии. Когда происходит задержание того, что должно быть извергнуто, от этого случаются различные болезни. Ничто так не избавляет от весенних болезней, как кровопускание, опорожнение, уменьшение еды и увеличение питья, а также ослабление силы опьяняющих напитков путем разбавления их водой. Моментов, указывающих на правильное решение о необходимости опорожнения: переполнение, сила, натура, благоприятные показания, внешность, возраст, особенности климата страны, привычка человека, профессия. Если же эти моменты противопоказывают тогда опорожнение запрещается: пустота тела, и слабость любой из трех сил, безусловно, не допускают опорожнения. Однако иногда допускается некоторое ослабление сил, чем допустить вред от отказа от опорожнения. Это относится к силам ощущения и движения, когда есть надежда, что можно устранить опасность, если она возникнет. Это относится ко всем силам. Сухая и горячая натура препятствует опорожнению. Холодная и влажная натура в силу отсутствия или слабости теплоты также препятствует ему. Что касается горячей и влажной натуры, то при ней весьма допустимо делать опорожнение. Что касается наружного облика человека, то если он слишком худощав или рыхлый, то запрещается делать опорожнение, опасаясь ослабления пневмы и силы. Поэтому со слабым и исхудавшим человеком, в крови которого много желчи, следует лечить лекарством, не делая опорожнения, и кормить такой пищей, от которой образуется хорошая кровь, склоняя натуру к холоду и влажности. Так иногда исправить натуру соков больного, а иногда поднять силу настолько, что она уже может перенести разного вида опорожнения. Не следует также предпринимать опорожнение человека, привыкшего есть мало, если найти выход избежать его опорожнения. Чрезмерное ожирение тоже препятствует опорожнению, ибо имеется опасность, что осилит холод, и опасность, что мясо зажмет сосуды и закроет их во время их опорожнения, вследствие этого задержится теплота, или излишки будут вытеснены во внутренности. Такие плохие показания, как готовность тела к расстройству желудка и спазмам, также препятствуют опорожнению. Возраст, не дошедший до полной зрелости, а также перешедший к увяданию, препятствует опорожнению. Очень жаркое и очень холодное время тоже препятствует этому. Очень жаркие южные страны тоже относятся к числу препятствующих моментов, потому что большая часть слабительных средств бывает горячей, а сочетание двух горячих и привлекающих средств становится невыносимым, и силы слабеют, внешняя теплота притягивает дурной сок наружу, а лекарство привлекает его вовнутрь, вследствие чего возникает противодействие, приводящее к остановке сока на месте. Северные, очень холодные страны также препятствуют опорожнению. Малая привычность к опорожнению тоже является препятствием. Работа, связанная с обильным потением, вроде службы в бане, работа грузчика, и вообще все профессии, связанные с тяжелым трудом, препятствуют опорожнению.",

      "abstract": "En Espana, el consumo de alcohol se ha asociado tradicionalmente a la poblacion adulta y se ha caracterizado por la regularidad de su uso, la vinculacion a la dieta y a los acontecimientos sociales. Sin embargo, los ultimos informes del Observatorio Espanol sobre Drogas han destacado la emergencia de un nuevo patron de consumo de alcohol con una gran prevalencia entre adolescentes y jovenes adultos. Esta forma de consumir se caracteriza por la ingesta de grandes cantidades de alcohol en cortos espacios de tiempo, principalmente en fin de semana, que suele llevar a la embriaguez. La literatura anglosajona denomina mayoritariamente a este patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol binge drinking (BD) o heavy episodic drinking (HED).\nEstudios realizados recientemente mediante modelos animales apuntan a una mayor vulnerabilidad del cerebro adolescente a los efectos neurotoxicos del alcohol, debido a la importante reestructuracion estructural y funcional que sufre el cerebro durante esta etapa, que en humanos abarca la segunda decada de la vida. Ademas, parece que el patron de consumo BD puede resultar significativamente mas danino para el cerebro que el consumo regular de alcohol.\n Sin embargo, a pesar de estos preocupantes datos y de la alta prevalencia del patron BD, el estudio de las posibles consecuencias neuropsicologicas asociadas a este modo de consumo es todavia escaso, no existiendo resultados concluyentes al respecto.\n El presente estudio tiene por objetivo principal determinar las consecuencias neuropsicologicas asociadas al patron de consumo BD en estudiantes universitarios de primer ano de carrera. Para ello, administramos una amplia bateria de pruebas neuropsicologicas que nos han permitido valorar diferentes funciones cognitivas. Los resultados muestran que los jovenes BD presentan, en relacion con sus pares No BD, un menor rendimiento en tarea que impliquen: memoria de trabajo verbal, memoria declarativa episodica verbal (tanto de forma inmediata como demorado) y funcionamiento ejecutivo (mayor susceptibilidad a la interferencia proactiva, menor flexibilidad cognitiva, y mayores dificultades de planificacion). Asimismo, tambien se ha comprobado que con una historia de consumo breve (media de cuatro anos), la vulnerabilidad a los efectos neurotoxicos del alcohol entre jovenes con patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol es semejante para ambos sexos.",

      "title": "Is nicotine important in tobacco smoking?",
      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is generally regarded as a form of nicotine dependence, but the evidence for this is slender. Two experiments are described here which examine the hypothesis that habitual smokers need nicotine and that they regulate their intakes of this drug. A laboratory test for smoking was devised which permitted the continuous monitoring of puffing as well as of selected physiologic variables; the procedure was also designed to reduce the influence of smoking habits and rituals. In the first experiment, inhaled amounts of tobacco smoke reduced subsequent ad libitum smoking in a dose-related way. In the second experiment comparable doses of nicotine were given intravenously to the same subjects, but they failed to affect ongoing smoking. However, both the inhaled and intravenous doses of the drug produced very similar physiologic effects. These experiments do not, therefore, support the nicotine-dependence hypothesis; thus the ways, if any, in which this drug sustains the tobacco-smoking habit merit further examination.",

      "abstract": "L'OMS include dipendenza da tabacco nella lista dei disturbi legati all'uso di sostanze farmacologiche e come tale deve essere trattata. Quindi il fumo di sigaretta oltre ad essere un vizio e/o un'abitudine e una vera e propria dipendenza. Infatti, delle 4000 sostanze tossiche che contiene una sigaretta, troviamo nicotina che e quella sostanza che induce alla dipendenza. E' sostanza che fa si che il fumatore cerchi sempre un'altra sigaretta e non riesca a farne a meno. La medicina ufficiale solo nel 1988 ha affermato che nicotina dava dipendenza come altre droghe, quali l'eroina e cocaina: la nicotina e sostanza contenuta nel tabacco che porta alla dipendenza... l'uso del tabacco risponde ai criteri correntemente utilizzati per definire l'assuefazione. Ecco perche per molti fumatori e difficile smettere di fumare. In questa prospettiva le proprieta gratificanti della nicotina e delle altre sostanze psicoattive dopo somministrazione in acuto possono essere inquadrate nel costrutto teorico delle azioni di rinforzo positivo delle droghe, mentre le proprieta motivazionali dell’astinenza possono essere considerate alla stregua di rinforzi negativi alla sospensione delle droghe d’abuso. Da queste considerazioni nasce nel quartiere Scampia di Napoli “Il progetto sfuma”, fortemente voluto dal Ministero della Salute, il Ministero del Lavoro e della Previdenza Sociale, dalla Regione Campania e dal Comune di Napoli, come strumento utile per liberare risorse in questo campo per tutela della salute pubblica. Al momento sono stati selezionati 80 operatori che hanno partecipato ad un corso di formazione specifico (aula e stage) per poi essere inseriti nei centri antifumo coordinati da dirigenti sanitari.",

      "abstract": "This literature review presents data on the effects of electronic cigarettes on the human body. The composition of vape liquid and the harm caused by each component separately, including glycerin, propylene glycol, is described. Vegetable glycerin is used for refueling electronic cigarettes, which determines the flavor. Propylene glycol is used to dissolve flavorings. The role of nicotine is more detailed than the other components, because among other things it is a neurotoxin and addictive. Literature sources have been analyzed to study the formation of pathological changes in tissues and organs during the use of electronic cigarettes. One of the first systems to be negatively affected by smoking is the respiratory system. Nicotine causes prolonged constriction of capillaries and arterioles, due to which normal gas exchange in the lungs is disturbed. Under the influence of nicotine is depressed activity of the nervous system. But the insidiousness of nicotine is not only that. Particularly dangerous to health long-term smoking. The brain gets used to the constant supply of nicotine. On the blood vessels nicotine has a spasmodic effect, promotes thrombosis. Diseases associated with the use of electronic delivery of nicotine, called EVALI, are presented, the latter meaning “lung injury associated with the use of electronic cigarettes”. The review emphasizes the negative effects of nicotine on the digestive system. Smoking contributes to narrowing of stomach vessels, gastric juice secretion is disturbed, and its composition changes, appetite decreases, peristalsis changes, and digestive diseases occur. To date, there is a growing trend in the number of people smoking electronic cigarettes, which is actively promoted by marketers [8]. They position smoking e-cigarettes as a fashion that does not cause harm to health. But this is a big misconception. E-smoking is virtually the same as regular smoking, except that e-cigarettes do not contain tar. The availability of vapes increases the trend of increasing use of these products by schoolchildren, which is a serious social problem.",

In particular, attention is given to the claim advanced by certain authorities and promulgated by sections of the alcoholic drinks industry, to the effect that a moderate intake of alcohol can actually have a beneficial effect on cognitive performance. It is concluded that, in general, alcohol has an adverse effect on cognitive performance. Apparent instances of beneficial effects associated with low doses most typically result from poorly conducted experiments or unusual combinations of circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Drug use can be defined as a kind of self destruction, and it is directly linked to attitudes toward death and suicide occurring in a significant number of users of different narcotics. The aim of the authors was to look for the background of this relationship between drug and death and examine the origin, development, and motives behind heroin overdose based on an analysis of previous studies. It seems clear that pure heroin overdose increased gradually over the years. The fear of the police is the inhibitory factor of the overdose prevention and notification of emergency health care service. Signs of suicide could be the own home as the chosen location for heroin overdose and the presence of partners (\"moment of death companion\"). Interventions should include simple techniques such as first aid, naloxone administration, resuscitation, prevention of relapse of prisoners and social network extension involving maintenance programs.A droghasználatot önmagában is öndestrukciónak tekinthetjük, így közvetve kötődik a halállal kapcsolatos attitűdhöz, és jelentős számban fordul elő különböző, a narkotikumok által okozott suicidium a droghasználók körében. A tanulmány célja, hogy feltárja a drog–halál kapcsolat eredetét, hátterét, és azon belül a heroin okozta túladagolások okait a témával foglalkozó tanulmányok elemzésével, eredményeik összefoglalásával. A tiszta heroinos túladagolók életkora az évek folyamán fokozatosan nő. A rendőrségtől való félelem a túladagolás megelőzését és a mentők értesítését gátló tényező. Az öngyilkosság szándékosságára utaló jel lehet a saját otthon mint választott hely, vagy a társak jelenléte, ami a halál pillanatában biztosított társat jelentheti. (Azt, hogy nincsenek egyedül a túladagolás pillanatában.) Ezért a segítségnyújtás egyszerűbb technikáit kell bevezetni: elsősegélynyújtás, naloxonbeadás, újraélesztés, a börtönviseltek visszaesésének megelőzése, a szociális háló kiterjesztése, a fenntartó programokba való bevonás.

      "title": "Is the use of nutritional supplements in dosage forms a \"gateway\" to oral substance abuse?",
      "abstract": "DEAR EDITOR,\r\n\r\nDietary supplements have become increasingly popular among children and adolescents in the recent years and their use is increasing. The results of several studies in different countries demonstrate significant increase in the consumption of different dietary supplements in all age groups.[1] In certain population such as athletes and students, the increasing oral use of dietary supplements has become a serious concern for stakeholders.[2]\r\n\r\nMeeting the daily dietary demand of trace elements and vitamins is the main justification of consumption of the dietary supplements. In other words, although prescription of nutritional supplements in children and adolescents is a therapeutic approach for the treatment of certain nutritional disorders, consumption of these products in different forms such as tablets, capsules, powders, and ampoules may contribute to an increase in frequency and amount of their intake. This can contribute to formation of a behavior of drug-form supplement intake regardless of their content which may itself, in turn, lead to an increase in their consumption among children and adolescents.\r\n\r\nIt can be argued that this new behavioral pattern may lead to an alarming tendency for repetition of taking drug forms with other contents which maybe ilicid or dangerous for adolescents.\r\n\r\nMany believe that today, we are witnessing a change of pattern from traditional to industrial substance abuse and oral agents are replacing the traditional smoked substances.[3]\r\n\r\nThis transformation, as well as normalization of consumption of oral dietary supplements, can be considered as an important contributing factor for involvement of individuals in a drug-abuse culture. Interestingly, it seems that this pattern is in line with the “gateway hypothesis.”[4]\r\n\r\nAccording to the gateway hypothesis, the misuse of licit substances such as alcohol or tobacco can facilitate the use of light illicit drugs such as marijuana; and this, in turn, in a gradual process, leads to the use of more addictive illicit substances such as heroin and cocaine. Thus, marijuana serves as a gateway for heavy-drug abuse. Based on this hypothesis, several countries have passed legislations and implemented strict policies against abuse of light illicit drugs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it can be suggested that normalization and internalization of regular use of a medication with health benefits such as nutritional supplements maybe a gateway toward abuse of oral drugs in different forms such as tablets, capsules, powders, etc., This argument can be supported by the demonstrated pattern that using licit sports supplements can lead to the use of anabolic hormones and illicit doping agents.[5] Of course, it should be noted that the role of other reinforces such as social determinants and peer pressures should not be ignored in this regard.\r\n\r\nHowever, further studies are warranted to shine more light on this issue and its validity. If proven true, more awareness-raising activities need to be carried out on the issue so that parents can effectively prevent the adverse effects of the excessive use of drug-form dietary supplements by their children.\r\n\r\nSeveral different alternative strategies can be adapted for the provision of dietary supplements in vulnerable groups such as fortification of milk and bread instead of drug forms of nutritional needs. This may effectively prevent from normalization and internalization of oral supplement intake behavior which may lead to the aforementioned abuse patterns and its consequences.",

      "abstract": "필로폰 등 마약을 사용한 사실을 증명하기 위해서는 현실적으로 피의자의 소변을 채취하여 일정한 과학적 검사를 행할 필요성이 있게 된다. 소변도 신체의 일부라는 점, 소변은 시간이지나면 자연히 체외로 배출된다는 점, 피의자에게 굴욕감 등 정신적 고통을 주어 인격의 존엄성을 해한다는 점 등을 이유로 소변의 강제채취를 허용할 수 없다는 입장도 있고, 비교법적으로는 미국과 독일이 이러한 소극적 입장을 취하는 대표적인 국가라고 할 수 있으나, 우리나라와 일본에 있어서의 다수설 및 판례는 소변강제채취의 필요성을 인정하고 있다. 즉 수사의 필요성, 마약범죄의 중대성, 수단의 비대체성, 사회적 상당성, 소변을 임의체출하는 방법에 의하여 피의자에게 사전에 정신적·신체적 고통으로부터 벗어날 수 있는 기회가 주어진다는 점, 의사 등 전문가에 의하여 행하여지면 상대방의 신체에 위해를 가할 염려가 적다는 점, 피의자를 알몸으로 하여 행하는 검증방법으로서의 신체검사와 비교해서도 상대방에게 주는 정신적 고통의 정도가 특별히 강하다고는 할 수 없다는 점 등을 이유로 소변의 강제채취가 허용된다고 본다. 소변의 강제채취가 일정한 요건하에 허용된다고 할 때, 다음으로 문제가 되는 것은 이를 위해서 요구되는 영장의 종류라고 할 수 있다. 이에 대해서는 검증(신체검사)영장을 요한다는 견해, 압수·수색영장을 요한다는 견해, 감정처분허가장을 요한다는 견해, 검증(신체검사)영장과 감정처분허가장을 요한다는 견해, 압수·수색영장과 감정처분허가장을 요한다는 견해 등이 주장되고 있고 각각 나름대로의 장점과 단점을 가지고 있으나, 소변의 강제채취행위는 수사기관이 행하는 증거물을 확보하기 위한 활동이라는 점에서 압수·수색의 성격을 가지며, 또한 의사등에 의하여 의학적으로 상당한 방법으로 실시되어야 할 뿐만 아니라 채취된 소변에 대한 분석이 전문 감정인에 의해서 이루어진다는 점에서는 감정에 필요한 처분으로서의 성격도 아울러 가진다고 할 수 있으므로 피의자로부터 소변을 강제로 채취하기 위해서는 압수·수색영장과 감정처분허가장이 모두 필요한 것으로 보아야 한다. 한편 판례는 소변이나 혈액의 채취를 위하여 사용할 수 있는 영장의 종류를 비교적 넓게 인정하여 감정처분허가장 또는 압수영장에 의하여 소변 등 체액의 채취를 할 수 있는 것으로 보고 있다. 또한 강제로 소변을 채취하는 경우 이를 위하여 피의자의 신체를 가까운 병원 등의 장소에 인치할 필요가 있는데, 소변의 임의제출을 거부하는 피의자를 이러한 장소에 인치하는 것이 허용되는지 허용된다면 어떠한 법적 근거에 의하여 허용되는지가 문제된다. 소변채취를 위한 강제연행은 신체의 자유라는 새로운 법익을 침해하는 행위이므로 소변채취를 위한 영장에 의해서는 이것이 허용되지 않는다고 보는 소극설도 있으나, 소변채취를 위하여 병원 등의 장소에 피의자를 강제로 인치하는 것은 압수·수색영장의 집행에 있어서 「필요한 처분」에 해당하여 허용된다고 보는 것이 타당하다.",

Diagnosis of voluntary caffeine overdose was made. The evolution was favorable after metabolic disorders correction, without the need for dialysis. Caffeine is a molecule free of serious adverse effects when consumed at low doses. However, when consumed at high doses, it can become toxic and lead to death. Caffeine consumption has increased in recent years and especially in French Army. This toxicity remains unknown by a large part of population. We must be vigilant because this substance misuse can lead to serious consequences.",

Despite knowing that smoking is dangerous and how it puts one's life at stake, many people ignore the risks and continue to smoke. A cigarette smoke contains more than 5000 chemicals, the main ingredients being tobacco and nicotine. At least 100 of these chemicals are carcinogenic, known to causecancers and other illnesses. Quitting cigarettes is not as hard as people think it is. It requires strong will power and motivation to quit smoking. Once a person becomes smoke free, the process of repair is initiated immediately. Within one week the person feels more energetic and healthy. Withinfew years the lungs become normal and return to their original state. Fortunately it's never too late to take a leap of faith and quit this bad habit for once and all.",

Assim o presente artigo tem o objetivo de evidenciar o uso do cigarro eletrônico e causas potenciais a saúde, identificando os danos causados pelo cigarro eletrônico ao usuário e consequentemente seu impacto na saúde pública. Trata-se o de um estudo de revisão narrativa da literatura, com abordagem qualitativa. O uso dos dispositivos eletrônicos torna-se um possível perpetuador do ato de fumar podendo representar iniciação e até mesmo a permanência no tabagismo. Já existem prejuízos relacionados ao uso dos cigarros eletrônicos (CE), eles provocam toxidade para o organismo, também pode causar dependência e provocar doenças nos sistemas pulmonar, cardiovascular e gastrointestinal, causando desequilíbrio no corpo humano, o uso do CE também está relacionado a problemas na saúde mental como, irritação. Fica claro que o uso do cigarro eletrônico promove prejuízos tanto para o usuário quando para a saúde pública, sendo necessário cada vez mais normas que fiscalizem a disseminação de propagandas e comercialização do produto. Assim sugere-se que novas pesquisas sejam realizadas afim que corroborar evidências dos malefícios do uso do CE, afim de entender seus diferentes aspectos e traçar estratégias para a diminuição de seus efeitos, visando a melhoria da saúde de toda a comunidade.",

      "title": "Why news about drug use by amateur athletes may not be all bad...",
      "abstract": "Media coverage of drugs in sport is all too often a soap opera, one with a cast of world famous, super wealthy and glamorous characters.\r\n\r\nToday’s BBC news however provides some perspective on the issue, as well as hinting at a crisis in amateur sport in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis news will likely not have the impact it should however, simply because there is no famous sports star implicated, no Maria Sharapova, no Lance Armstrong. Unlike the current investigation into British Cycling, there is nothing for the media to really get their claws into. This story will likely go away very quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd this highlights a serious failing in the way that we deal with doping in sport. Today’s news is far more serious than any story about elite athletes and drugs. It indicates several things. First that doping is not confined to the ranks of the elite, and is widespread in grass roots sport. Second, unlike trends related to alcohol and nicotine use in the UK, the problem with sports drugs is increasingly evident among the young. Third, whilst remaining related to sports, the use of performance enhancing drugs is often not only about winning per se, but also related to issues ranging from pain management to self-esteem.\r\n\r\nThese three factors all hint at what could be serious cultural problems for sport and for society more generally.\r\n\r\nThe CEO of UK Anti Doping, Nicola Sapstead, indicates that there is a problem with funding, and “a woeful lack of education at the amateur level”. The problem however is not so simple; education is a double edged sword in this context. This is demonstrated by data from a recent large-scale study conducted by Philip Hurst and colleagues at Canterbury Christ Church University. The study indicates that among athletes who had not previously considered using performance enhancing substances, receiving an educational intervention made 25% of them more likely to use these in the future.\r\n\r\nWhy would this be the case? Once again it’s a function of the soap opera of sport. If the athletes who received positive tests were minor players, the also-rans, perhaps the message would be less powerful. But all too often they’re not; the roll call of dopers in sport is not one associated with failure. Day on day we hear stories of World Champions testing positive, of Olympic medals being rescinded as new technologies allow old urine samples to be retested.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the stories that make the news are about the winners, we rarely hear anything about the athlete who was eliminated in the first heat. The subtext is ‘to win, you have to dope’.\r\n\r\nThe situation is complicated further by the ‘legal doping’ of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), which whilst being within the letter of the law, are increasingly seen by many as being significantly beyond the spirit, in some if not all cases.\r\n\r\nIn short, the education that junior athletes are receiving via the media is all too often not that performance enhancing drugs are unethical and sometimes dangerous, but that winners take drugs.\r\n\r\nThis is why today’s news story is so important. It tells us that not all dopers are winners, that many dopers are perhaps relatively unfit – and as is implicated in the story, overweight – middle ranking amateur athletes, taking drugs not to win but to manage pain and self image. In sports terms, these people are not ‘winners’.\r\n\r\nThis should be the big news story: it’s not just winners, losers take drugs as well. Shifting the media spotlight away from an emphasis on drug use amongst winners and towards drug use among the also-rans might be a very powerful anti doping intervention in itself.\r\n\r\nBut the key message from today’s news is this: whatever the content of the intervention itself, anti-doping education has to start in our schools and our homes at an early age. Waiting until an athlete has reached the ranks of the promising might mean that they have already been exposed to cultures in which doping is not only accepted, but is the norm.",

Investigation is required where there is weight loss or inadequate weight gain, choking on feeds or recurrent aspiration pneumonia. This chapter presents a differential diagnosis of poor feeding in infancy. Delay in establishing feeds may indicate an underlying neurological condition. Children/adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders may have a very limited food repertoire, only eating a very few selected foods. Some children with Asperger's report little appetite and no hunger and consequently may eat little. The chapter discusses the causes of poor feeding in the older child. Children with food neophobia eat only a very limited diet, often only dry foods and very little fruits or vegetables. Encouraging playing with food, other messy play and regular times outside of meal to try new foods may be of benefit.",

He is very concerned because his primary care physician told him he has 2 serious smoking-related health problems: diabetes and hypertension. He tried a smoking cessation program for the general public, but it was a poor fit because of his schizophrenia symptoms. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Despite adhering to his medications (ziprasidone, 20 mg hs; perphenazine, 8 mg hs; lorazepam, 1 mg hs; zonisamide, 200 mg/d, and benztropine mesylate, 2 mg hs), Mr. V has residual auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and impaired concentration and attention. He smokes approximately 1.5 packs per day, particularly when very ill, to alleviate chronic boredom, and to diminish distress from the hallucinations. All of his friends smoke, and they do not support his attempts to quit. Successfully treating nicotine dependence can seem a formidable challenge in patients with schizophrenia: * 72% to 90% smoke cigarettes, compared with 21% of the general population1 (Box, page 66). (2-12) * They tend to smoke heavily, spending about one-third of their incomes on cigarettes. (13) * Their negative symptoms (such as apathy), positive symptoms (such as disorganized thinking), and cognitive impairment can reduce motivation to quit and adhere to a smoking cessation strategy. * Sociologic and physiologic aspects of schizophrenia reinforce their smoking habit (Table 1, page 69). (9,12,14-17) Even so, smokers with schizophrenia can be highly motivated and persistent in attempting to quit. (18) Promising results have been reported in trials when psychopharmacologic treatments are combined with cognitive and behavioral interventions. This article reviews these empiric studies and suggests practical ways for clinicians to create smoking cessation and relapse prevention plans for individuals with schizophrenia. Clinical trials of smoking cessation Inadequate interventions. Conventional regimens--consisting of 8 to 12 weeks with sustained-release bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) added to supportive or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) (19)--are well-tolerated by patients with schizophrenia but only modestly effective. CBT alone (or with placebo) has not been effective for smoking cessation in schizophrenia. In clinical trials, abstinence rates have been: * 4% to 19% after 3 to 6 months with bupropion or NRT and CBT * [less than or equal to]6% with placebo and CBT. (20-23) Multifaceted interventions. High-dose NRT patch treatment (2 patches at a time) has not consistently shown additional benefits compared with single-patch treatment. (24,25) However, combining short-acting NRT (gum, lozenge, inhaler, or nasal spray) with a long-acting NRT preparation (transdermal patch) is well-tolerated and has been shown to improve sustained abstinence rates (26) (Table 2, page 70). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, (27) 51 smokers with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive combination NRT (21-mg NRT patch plus [less than or equal to]18 mg/d NRT polacrilex gum prn) added to bupropion SR, 150 mg bid, or placebo. Smoking cessation--defined as quitting on the assigned date and maintaining continuous abstinence for 4 weeks (measured by expired air carbon monoxide * 52% of those receiving bupropion and dual NRT * 19% who received placebo and the 2 forms of NRT. Preventing relapse. Relapse is common among all smokers but especially in those with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, 70% to 83% of smokers with schizophrenia who attained abstinence relapsed to smoking within 6 to 12 months of stopping nicotine dependence treatment. (21,22,27,28) In one clinical trial, >50% of patients achieved 4 weeks of continuous abstinence on a regimen of bupropion SR, 150 mg bid; nicotine patch (21 mg/d); and as-needed nicotine gum ([less than or equal to]18 mg/d). …",

The answer to this question is crucial to public health policy on control of drugs and alcohol, but it remains unanswered. Part of the difficulty lies in the different indicators of increasing use — per capita consumption versus incidence of new use — which measure separate aspects of growth of use. A second problem is related to the length of time between first use of a substance and the appearance of serious consequences. For those users who evolve to abusers, this interval is short for some drugs (like heroin) and long for others (like alcohol).",

      "title": "Social psychological factors in tackling obesity",
      "abstract": "In the fight to reduce rising levels of obesity, a persistent obstacle is the psychological conflict between things people want to eat – for instance, fatty or sweet foods – and good health. People have very mixed feelings and beliefs about healthy lifestyle options. They experience positive sensations from eating foods that provide excessive calorie and salt content, yet finding the time to exercise (which in itself they may find unpleasant) is difficult. People know that rich foods are bad for them but, on the other hand, they also know that moderate exercise is good for them (1). No one escapes the psychological conflict, or ‘ambivalence’ that ensues. Yet, public information campaigns insist on simply reminding people to avoid certain foods and to exercise, rather than helping to resolve this deep-seated ambivalence. Ambivalence is an important issue because prior experimental evidence from the field of social psychology reveals it to be an important obstacle to healthy behaviour. Health-related ambivalence makes it psychologically difficult to resist the temptations of unhealthy choices. Several studies illustrate the effort required to overcome unhealthy temptations (2). In one study, young teenagers were given the opportunity to eat a large quantity of crisps, which they consumed with glee. The experimenter then presented them with a jug of Quench, a ‘new’ bright-red drink, along with a written description of its positive and negative attributes. The thirsty participants were told that they could have some of the drink, but it would be better to wait until later because supplies were short. The participants then sat alone with the drink for 10 min. During this time, the experimenter unobtrusively videotaped them and gave them an additional questionnaire to assess the ways in which they had coped with their temptation to drink the beverage. Analyses revealed that the participants tried a range of strategies to avoid drinking the beverage. Some participants moved the tasty-looking juice away from them. Others tried to focus attention on other materials that were available in the laboratory (e.g. magazines) or tried to highlight the negative (not positive) aspects of the drink in the questionnaire that the experimenter had given to them. In addition, participants even created negative attributes of the drink (e.g. that it was ‘too sweet’) that were never even mentioned in the initial, brief description. These behaviours betray a high amount of psychological effort aimed at combating temptation. More important, this effort occurred more strongly when the experimenter emphasized that the participants were free to choose whether or not to consume the beverage. Freedom of choice makes it more difficult to resist temptation. Other research and theory indicate that stress (3,4) and habit formation also impede the ability to resist temptation (5). Yet, choice, stress and habit are all inescapable or difficult to reduce. So how can we help people cope with this ambivalence? Unfortunately, there is good reason to doubt the efficacy of interventions that simply provide new persuasive information. The problem is that people who are high in ambivalence towards an issue carefully scrutinise any information that can help resolve their conflict (6,7). As a result, ambivalent individuals are more likely to pick out flaws in the messages when the messages are overly simplistic (e.g. ‘just say no’) and form more negative attitudes and behaviours towards the healthy options after detecting the flaws. Indeed, a series of studies sponsored by the Economic and Social Research Council have demonstrated this type of backfire when anti-racism messages are presented to people who are highly ambivalent towards ethnic-minority groups (8). A more basic problem with a persuasive information approach is that it may fail to positively affect non-conscious evaluations of health-related behaviours. Indeed, the research on anti-racism messages revealed backfire effects of persuasive messages on implicit measures of attitude, which assess evaluations that people are unable or unwilling to retrieve from memory (9–11). Implicit measures do not ask people to directly report their attitudes but, instead, assess their attitudes without their immediate awareness or control (e.g. using subliminal presentation of stimuli). Importantly, responses on implicit measures are often discordant with self-reported (explicit) attitudes. For example, a person may explicitly report that she dislikes chocolate cake because of its perceived health impact, yet she exhibits a strong desire to eat the cake on an implicit measure (compare this with the work of Roefs et al. (12)). This difference is important because it is the scores on the implicit measures that tend to best predict actual spontaneous behaviour (13,14). Thus, it is vital that interventions manage to influence the associations tapped by the implicit measures and not just the attitudes obtained by self-report measures. It is likely that this non-conscious attitude change requires repeated and creative interventions to change attitudes – even a single powerful message might not be enough to elicit long-term non-conscious change (15). Potential clues to addressing this problem are revealed by important evidence that ambivalence has unique neurological properties. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging brain imaging techniques, Cunningham et al. found that regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), specifically the ventrolateral PFC, are more active when people make evaluations of objects that elicit ambivalence, over and above the activity associated with emotional valence and intensity, in regions such as the amygdala (16). This pattern indicates that ambivalence has unique neuropsychological substrates, which may help us understand the effects of ambivalence on behaviour. In fact, such evidence may help to solve an interesting behavioural puzzle about ambivalence. Specifically, ambivalence tends to elicit polarized responses to the objects of the ambivalence (i.e. extremely positive or extremely negative) (1), despite eliciting enhanced scrutiny of relevant persuasive messages as described above (7). In other words, ambivalent people tend to respond in extreme ways that are consistent with salient situational factors, despite resisting direct social influence. One potential resolution is that the polarization and resistance effects occur over different timescales. The studies showing response polarization have used very obvious and immediate cues (e.g. mood; good behaviour) that may be salient within a ‘teachable moment’, when a person is still processing their conflicting evaluations. In contrast, the persuasive messages require longer periods of attention and deliberation, and they may fail, partly because they are not comprehended early enough during the person’s thoughts about an object, and before the person has begun to resolve their ambivalence in a particular direction. Neurological scanning can be used to better track the time course of ambivalence (e.g. using event-related potential or magnetoencephalography) and to test whether situational cues have a different impact during the activation of brain regions that are associated with ambivalence than after this activation has subsided. Such evidence may reveal ways in which interventions can be shaped to use, rather than challenge, ambivalence. For example, it may be possible to develop signage or messages that give instant pictorial cues to healthy behaviour immediately after eliciting feelings of ambivalence about a behaviour. These approaches may be more successful than those that use drawn-out print messages for ambivalent topics. Ambivalence and difficulties in trying to resolve it are important in the health context. It is important to develop interventions that are capable of affecting the non–conscious associations that plausibly direct many unhealthy behaviours, and the tools are present to test this possibility. There are also powerful tools (e.g. brain imaging techniques) for looking more directly at the neurological structure and consequences of health-related ambivalence. The use of such tools can coincide with attempts to explore the ways in which social psychological approaches to healthy behaviour change can be adapted to suit public health interventions. We believe that this agenda should be an important aim for future research. No conflict of interest was declared.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Alcohol drinking is a popular activity among adolescents in many countries, largely due to its pleasant, relaxing effects. As a major concern, ethanol consumption put the drinkers at risk of nutrients' deficiency due to the disordered eating, anorexia, and malabsorption of nutrients. Moreover, alcohol drinking may lead to the development of hangover symptoms including diarrhea, thirsty, fatigue, and oxidative stress. A broad range of functional food components with antioxidant and/or anti‐inflammatory properties including pectin, aloe vera polysaccharides, chito‐oligosaccharides, and other herbal components have been explored due to their detoxification effects against ethanol. The underlying anti‐hangover mechanisms include reducing the intestinal absorption of ethanol or its metabolites, increasing the activity of ethanol metabolizing enzymes, development of fatty acid β‐oxidation in mitochondria, inhibition of inflammatory response, blocking the target receptors of ethanol in the body, and possession of antioxidant activity under the oxidative stress developed by ethanol consumption. Therefore, the development of bioactive food‐based therapeutic formula can assist clinicians and also drinkers in the alleviation of alcohol side effects.",

      "abstract": "The hardening hypothesis proposes that as smoking prevalence declines, the proportion of ‘hard-core’ or ‘hardened’ smokers increases. The intuitively plausible logic is that less addicted and more motivated smokers are more likely to quit, leaving behind a growing proportion of ‘hardened’ smokers. If true, the hypothesis has implications for policy formulation and smoking cessation practice. For example, smokefree policies, health promotion campaigns and smoking cessation support services may need to be modified to ensure they reach and support quitting among the growing proportion of hardened smokers. Also, hardening would strengthen the justification for harm reduction strategies due to the need to provide less harmful alternatives to the increasing proportion of ‘hardened’ smokers who struggle to quit.\n\nThere are many ways in which hardening could manifest, creating multiple hypotheses which can be tested. For example, the population of smokers could become: (1) more highly addicted (eg, an increase in heavier or more dependent smokers); (2) less motivated to quit (eg, more smokers with no or low intention to quit, not making quit attempts or with lower self-efficacy about quitting); and (3) increasingly disadvantaged and marginalised (eg, more smokers who are disadvantaged or have mental health conditions). The net effect should be a reduced rate of quitting among the smoking population over time.\n\nSo what is the evidence for hardening? Most studies that have looked at the different aspects of hardening, either singly or in combination, are repeated surveys from the same population.

Like many other health issues, Ayurveda is also essential in the de-addiction of society. Here, an effort has been made to explain the role of Ayurveda in de-addiction. Ayurveda classic and modern texts have been searched for information on this topic. Online screening of research articles has also been done. Addiction is a burning issue in society. It is found more or less all over the world. Many efforts are made to prevent addiction and to do de-addiction. Public awareness programs are implemented to prevent addiction. Ayurvedic solutions explained in Ayurvedic texts should be followed for de-addiction. Addiction is a curse for society, especially for the young generation. For addicted persons, drugs should be withdrawn by Padanshik krama, Ayurvedic medications should be given, and psychological counselling and Yoga should be suggested.",

      "abstract": "Alkoholin kulutus on ollut viime vuosina hiljalleen kasvussa, ja ennusteiden mukaan se tulee lahivuosina kasvamaan noin 3-4 prosentin vuosivauhdilla. Alkoholin kulutuksen kasvu nakyy myos Oulun seudun yhteispaivystyksessa, jossa kay vuosittain noin 81 900 henkea alueen vaestosta. Arviolta noin 10 – 15 % kavijoista kayttaa alkoholia niin runsaasti, etta kulutus aiheuttaa oireita tai vaarantaa terveyden. Perusterveydenhuollon tehtavana on tunnistaa ja hoitaa potilaita, joiden terveyden saattaa vaarantaa liian suuri alkoholinkulutus. Erityisen tarkeaa riskikayton tunnistamisessa ja mini-interventiossa on, etta henkilot, jotka eivat ole riippuvaisia viela alkoholin kaytosta, saattavat vahentaa tai lopettaa alkoholin juomisen, kun heita sopivalla tavalla tuetaan. \r\n\r\nTama tutkimus on toimintatutkimuksen periaatteilla eteneva kehittamistyo. Tarkoituksena oli toiminnan ja tutkimuksen vuorovaikutuksessa selvittaa mini-intervention soveltuvuutta yhteispaivystykseen. Selvityksen tuloksena saatua tietoa hyodynnettiin jatkossa kehittaessamme sairaanhoitajan tyovalineeksi yhteispaivystykseen sopivaa alkoholin riskikayttajan mini-interventiomallia. Toimintatutkimuksen toteutukseen liittyi hoitohenkilokunnan koulutuksen suunnittelu ja toteuttaminen seka mini-interventiomallin kokeilu ja arviointi. Toimintatutkimuksen tarkoituksena oli kehittaa tyoyhteison toimintatapoja terveytta edistavaksi alkoholin riskikayttajan hoidossa. \r\n\r\nToimintatutkimukseni toteutus eteni vaiheittain sisaltaen kartoitus-, toteuttamis- ja arviointivaiheen. Kartoitusvaiheen kyselyssa selvitin sairaanhoitajien halukkuutta osallistua mini-intervention toteuttamiseen. Arvioin sairaanhoitajien koulutuksen tarpeen, suunnittelin ja toteutin koulutuksen. Koulutuksen jalkeen sairaanhoitajat sitoutuivat toteuttamaan mini-interventiota alkoholin riskikayttajan hoidossa. Mini-intervention toteuttamisen jalkeen potilaat ja sairaanhoitajat vastasivat kyselyyn mini-intervention kokemuksista. Lopuksi arvioin toiminnan ja tyoyhteisossa hyvaksyttiin uusi toimintamalli sairaanhoitajan tyovalineeksi.\r\n\r\nArvioinnin perusteella osa sairaanhoitajista piti tieto-taitoa riittavana ja mini-intervention toteuttamista positiivisena asiana, osa sairaanhoitajista arvioi tarvitsevansa lisakoulutusta alkoholin riskikayttajan tunnistamiseen.

Food officials in the United States and Europe have stated that oral consumption of this substance is generally safe. However, there is a lot of discussion about PG. Reports of PG poisoning are mostly related to inappropriate intravenous use or accidental overuse by children. Because of its low risk of food poisoning, it is recognized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a relatively safe substance as a food additive such as frozen desserts, ice cream and frozen foods. This article examines what is oral propylene glycol and why is it used? Also, in the current study, it was tried to answer this question: Is it dangerous for the body or not? It's found that while there have been incidents of intoxication from this material due to the usage of extremely high doses, it is not regarded a harmful or poisonous substance in general.",

      "title": "Smoking Sue e os Efeitos do Tabagismo",
      "abstract": "CARACTERIZACAO DO PROBLEMA: Ha milenios a humanidade convive com substancias que tem a capacidade de produzir alteracoes fisicas e mentais, dentre elas o tabaco. Ao longo deste periodo fatores culturais e sociais (como festas e comemoracoes) estao relacionados ao consumo do mesmo (BERTOLOTE, 2010). O tabaco e definido como qualquer preparacao das folhas da Nicotiana tabacum proveniente de uma planta nativa da America, sendo seu principal ingrediente a nicotina, que e um agente psicoativo. Ja o tabagismo e um vocabulo de origem francesa que se refere a condicao de dependencia da nicotina, em que o fumante apresenta graves sintomas de abstinencia (BERTOLOTE, 2010). A dependencia e caracterizada pela ocorrencia de fenomenos comportamentais, cognitivos e fisiologicos que se desenvolvem apos o uso repetido de uma dada substância e com a cessacao ou reducao do uso das mesmas, ocorre a abstinencia que geralmente e acompanhada por sinais de alteracoes fisiologicas (BERTOLOTE, 2010). O tabagismo constitui um importante problema de saude, colocando-se entre as causas mais comuns de morte por neoplasias malignas. Segundo Bogliolo (2011, p.430), “sua incidencia vem crescendo nos ultimos 60 anos, coincidindo com o aumento paralelo na producao de tabaco e no consumo de cigarros”. E tornou-se responsavel por cerca de 90% dos casos de câncer de pulmao nos homens e 70% em mulheres. Cerca de 20% dos fumantes desenvolvem câncer pulmonar. O tabagismo aumenta a chance de câncer de pulmao, de forma proporcional ao tamanho da exposicao considerando entao o numero de cigarros fumados/dia x tempo. Assim, quem fuma charutos ou cachimbo tambem tem mais risco de desenvolver câncer de pulmao. Mesmo sem inalar, existe o aumento do risco de tumores de cabeca e pescoco nos usuarios. Ha tambem maior risco em fumantes passivos, que vivem em exposicao prolongada ao ar aonde alguem esta fumando. Estima-se que a cada tres cigarros fumados por um fumante, o individuo que divide o ambiente esta inalando um cigarro inteiro (MARTINS; BRANDAO NETO; LADEIRA; DIEHL; TAKAHASKI; 2007). Na decada de 90 houve uma queda de casos e de mortes em homens com aumento em mulheres, implicando diretamente no aumento do numero de mulheres tabagistas (MARTINS; BRANDAO NETO; LADEIRA; DIEHL; TAKAHASKI; 2007). Segundo o INCA (2011) O tabagismo passivo e a 3a maior causa de morte evitavel no mundo, subsequente ao tabagismo ativo e ao consumo excessivo de alcool. O ar poluido contem, em media, tres vezes mais nicotina, tres vezes mais monoxido de carbono, e ate cinquenta vezes mais substâncias cancerigenas do que a fumaca que entra pela boca do fumante depois de passar pelo filtro do cigarro. Neste sentido, este estudo tem por objetivo relatar a experiencia de academicas do curso de enfermagem na realizacao de uma atividade educativa sobre o Tabagismo e doencas associadas, com enfoque especial no câncer de pulmao. DESCRICAO DA EXPERIENCIA: Trata-se de um relato sobre a experiencia obtida por meio de uma exposicao realizada no evento intitulado EXPOCEEP que se realizou no Centro Estadual de Educacao Profissional Pedro Boaretto Neto (CEEP), na cidade de Cascavel, estado do Parana, nos dias 21 e 22 de outubro do ano de 2011, no periodo noturno. A EXPOCEEP e um evento realizado anualmente e tem como objetivo a apresentacao a comunidade dos cursos da escola e atividades desenvolvidas pelos alunos. As academicas de enfermagem que vivenciaram essa experiencia sao oriundas da Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana (UNIOESTE) e participantes do Programa Institucional de Bolsa de Iniciacao a Docencia (PIBID) o qual possibilitou a participacao das mesmas nessa atividade. Trata-se de uma apresentacao dialogada, expositiva e nao-formal na qual utilizou-se para demonstracao a Smoking Sue, que representava o ato de fumar: o cigarro era introduzido na boca da boneca e aceso. Em seguida as academicas simulavam o ato, apertando e soltando a pera que representava o torax da boneca; apos isso a fumaca inalada passava pelo tubo de ensaio que representava o pulmao humano e as substâncias toxicas depositavam-se no tubo. A medida que os cigarros eram consumidos pela boneca, aumentava o deposito de substâncias no tubo, conferindo-lhe um aspecto escurecido, demonstrando as alteracoes pulmonares ao longo da vida de um fumante. O local escolhido foi o patio da escola, pois era um local com grande fluxo de pessoas alem de ter possibilitado o desenvolvimento da atividade minimizando os efeitos da fumaca do cigarro. Ao longo da demonstracao, as academicas abordaram conteudos referentes ao tabaco. EFEITOS ALCANCADOS: Acreditamos que a atividade tenha sido exitosa, pois a comunidade que se aproximava do local onde ocorria a apresentacao, sendo varios deles atraidos pela boneca exposta, inclusive as criancas. Houve grande interesse sobre o funcionamento da Smoking Sue e do assunto em questao nos dois dias de exposicao. Alguns visitantes participaram ativamente, relatando experiencias e esclarecendo suas duvidas com as academicas, sendo as mais comuns acerca da dependencia, fumantes passivos e câncer de pulmao. O objetivo do trabalho nao teve enfoque quantitativo, entretanto, observou-se que grande parte dos visitantes relatou ser fumante, ja ter fumado e/ou conhecer alguem nessa situacao. RECOMENDACOES: Acredita-se que essa atividade educativa tenha possibilitado esclarecimento quanto aos riscos do consumo do tabaco para a saude humana. Confiamos que atividades educativas semelhantes a essa aqui apresentada sao importantes para a formacao academica dos estudantes de enfermagem e as mesmas devem estar presentes nos curriculos de graduacao.

El problema se va complicando hasta que logra una dimensión colosal, lo cual conlleva a que los gobiernos y las organizaciones multilaterales convoquen convenciones internacionales como la de Nueva York en 1961 y Viena en 1971 para desarrollar, no solo un discurso, sino también una posición política que proclama la preocupación de las naciones por la “salud física y moral de la humanidad”, a su vez que se comprometen a prevenir y combatir el mal de la toxicomanía.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Poppy tea drinking was a widespread traditional practice in the Fenlands of East Anglia during the nineteenth century. The subsequent social changes which led to greater integration of the area with the rest of the country may have contributed to a decline in the practice. In recent years poppy tea drinking has been revived within the illicit drug using community and a survey using a self‐report questionnaire was carried out among patients attending the Cambridge Drug Dependency Unit. Forty‐three patients admitted to drinking poppy tea, usually during the summer months and on an intermittent basis. The potency of the infusion varied and was unpredictable but in general was low. Although poisoning from herbicides and pesticides was seen as the main risk, it is in the main perceived by drug users as a harmless secondary activity existing alongside the more regular and more potent drugs of misuse.",

      "title": "O uso nocivo de crack: percepções de pessoas em tratamento da dependência",
      "abstract": "O uso de drogas sempre permeou a existencia humana, sendo visto em determinados grupos sociais como um comportamento natural uma vez que alivia dores e sofrimentos em alguns momentos e produz estimulo e entusiasmo entre outros. A cocaina e uma das drogas cujo consumo tem crescido nos ultimos anos na America do Sul, e em especial no Brasil, sendo uma de suas apresentacoes, o crack a mais consumida. Essa droga ilicita, estimulante do sistema nervoso central, muitas vezes leva a pessoa dependente a ter prejuizos no âmbito fisico, economico e social. O isolamento ao qual a pessoa dependente do crack esta exposta configura-se em situacao extrema de vulnerabilidade social que se expoem a consequencias de uma conjuntura social maior e mais abrangente que transcende o ato de usar a droga. O objetivo deste estudo foi compreender os significados do uso nocivo de crack por pessoas em tratamento da dependencia. Pesquisa social de abordagem qualitativa, na modalidade estrategica realizada em um hospital psiquiatrico com 39 participantes distribuidos em oito grupos focais. Foi realizada observacao do campo com registros em diario de campo. As reunioes foram gravadas e posteriormente transcritas e analisadas por meio do metodo de interpretacao de sentidos. Emergiram tres categorias tematicas que foram discutidas a luz teorica da vulnerabilidade social proposta por Robert Castel. A primeira, “descoberta do crack e outras drogas” descreve as motivacoes para o uso e diferencia a experimentacao do crack com o de outras drogas. As motivacoes citadas foram a curiosidade, excesso de liberdade dos pais e alivio para alguma decepcao da vida e, tambem a influencia de amigos. A categoria “dor do prazer” descreve o momento apos experimentacao do crack quando se instala a dependencia, levando a um ciclo de periodos curtos de tentativa de abstinencia, recaida e consumo incessante. Em suas falas, embora o crack tenha sido considerado a droga que, paradoxalmente, proporciona prazer e alivio aos sofrimentos, leva ao consumo desenfreado, fissura incontrolavel, prejuizos no trabalho, venda de bens e afastamento da familia, conflito com traficantes e policiais, independentemente, nesse estudo, de poder aquisitivo. Por ultimo, na categoria “retomar a vida” os participantes descrevem o desejo de mudanca de vida apos chegarem a uma situacao extrema de uso da droga, falta de dinheiro, conflitos em seu meio social. Apontam ainda, o sentimento de desespero por nao mais quererem usar o crack e nao serem capazes disso em virtude da dependencia. Os resultados permitiram observar que antes mesmo da dependencia do crack os participantes ja se encontravam numa situacao de vulnerabilidade social. A abordagem de pessoas em tratamento da dependencia do crack deve ser realizada no sentido de reduzir a distância entre essas pessoas e a familia, sociedade e servicos de saude, sendo esse o ponto de partida para profissionais de saude na proposicao de acoes de promocao da saude.",

Effective therapies include the nicotine gum, transdermal preparations, inhaler and spray. Highly dependent smokers should be offered high dose gum (4 mg) or nicotine spray. The nicotine inhaler offers more habit replacement than any of the other forms of nicotine administration and is appropriate for smokers who are moderately addicted and need something to do with their hands. Use of nicotine replacement therapy is safe for most patients with cardiovascular disease, but should probably be restricted in pregnancy to heavy smokers who are unable to quit. Bupropion, a modest dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, increases quit rates compared with placebo. Future therapies will include combinations of nicotine replacement products, and combinations of nicotine products with other medications. Some smokers may benefit from longer treatment and more gradual withdrawal than present treatment regimens imply.",

      "title": "Contamination of dietary supplements and positive drug tests in sport",
      "abstract": "The use of dietary supplements is widespread in sport and most athletes competing at the highest level of competition use some form of dietary supplementation. Many of these supplements confer no performance or health benefit, and some may actually be detrimental to both performance and health when taken in high doses for prolonged periods. Some supplements contain excessive doses of potentially toxic ingredients, while others do not contain significant amounts of the ingredients listed on the label. There is also now evidence that some of the apparently legitimate dietary supplements on sale contain ingredients that are not declared on the label but that are prohibited by the doping regulations of the International Olympic Committee and of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Contaminants that have been identified include a variety of anabolic androgenic steroids (including testosterone and nandrolone as well as the pro-hormones of these compounds), ephedrine and caffeine. This contamination may in most cases be the result of poor manufacturing practice, but there is some evidence of deliberate adulteration of products. The principle of strict liability that applies in sport means that innocent ingestion of prohibited substances is not an acceptable excuse, and athletes testing positive are liable to penalties. Although it is undoubtedly the case that some athletes are guilty of deliberate cheating, some positive tests are likely to be the result of inadvertent ingestion of prohibited substances present in otherwise innocuous dietary supplements.",

As consumers age the prevalence of acne decreases, although it can be triggered by factors such as stress, medications, and the use of cosmetics [2-4]. Indeed, there are many reports of cosmetics causing comedones, or acneform eruptions. These adverse reactions are of great concern to consumers, many of whom look for products that will not cause such problems. Hence, cosmetics manufacturers strive to develop products that do not cause comedones or acne. Products are frequently labeled noncomedogenic and/or nonacnegenic. Consumers use these terms interchangeably, although comedone formation and acnegenicity are not the same. To consumers, the key issue is that the cosmetics they use do not cause breakouts.",

Effects of cannabis include impaired psychomotor performance, perceptual changes, attentional failure, and prolonged reaction time. Effects are dose-related.

      "title": "Inhaled nicotine replacement therapy",
      "abstract": "There are a large number of smokers who want to quit smoking but have failed in their attempts to do so, with many having been unsuccessful at quitting multiple times over their lifetime. The existing marketed nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) have only marginal effectiveness and none provide a comparable physiological response to that derived from cigarette smoking; that is, rapid absorption of nicotine from the lung leading to peak levels of nicotine in the bloodstream to target the receptors in the brain. Instead, existing NRTs produce a slower and delayed rise in nicotine blood levels which is less effective at reducing the craving sensations. Published data for electronic cigarettes show that they typically deliver nicotine with a profile closer to that for nicotine patches, with a slow rise that can take 30–60 min, or longer, to reach the same peak nicotine concentration that is produced in less than 3 min from a single cigarette. A number of attempts have been made to develop an inhaled product which would deliver the nicotine through the lung and mimic the physiological response from smoking, but many of them produced intolerable aversive reactions or delivered an ineffective dose. This paper discusses examples of the potential for the recent inhaled nicotine products in development to be effective as NRTs, but is not meant to be a comprehensive review.",

The gas phase represents approximately 60% of the smoke from the burning of tobacco, 99% of this phase is composed of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, argon, and methane. Atherosclerosis associated with smoking is not necessarily an effect of nicotine, but probably the joint action of the various constituents of cigarette smoke. ROS from the gas phase of tobacco contributes to the onset and progression of atherosclerosis.

      "abstract": "Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) has become a popular new drug of abuse. Its effects include euphoria and disinhibition. Recently, several cases have been reported in the literature of life-threatening or lethal ingestions. We report the case of a 17-year-old male who became unresponsive after taking GHB. Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid is used outside the United States to treat narcolepsy. In the past, it was touted as a muscle-bulking aid and was taken by body-builders. It has also been implicated as a drug involved in \"date-rapes.\" Patients who ingest excessive GHB have a markedly altered level of consciousness, as did the patient in this illustrative case. Neostigmine and physostigmine show promise as potential reversal agents. Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid overdose should be considered in any patient with altered mental status and a history of recreational drug abuse.",

      "title": "TOBACCO: POLICING AND SOCIAL POLICY",
      "abstract": "Tobacco has exercised the interest of the nation since Elizabethan times, and the inhalation of its smoke for pleasure has become very widespread. It was not until the mid‐twentieth century, however, that its effects upon health were suspected. It is now widely accepted that tobacco smoke is implicated in a range of dangerous diseases, although the tobacco industry sometimes argues that the link is not proven. The arguments about the conflicting needs of a large, world‐wide industry and the health and prosperity of individuals and society are complex, and often influenced by conflicting vested interests. Government's involvement in the issues is further complicated by its reliance upon large tobacco revenues. The link between advertising and increased smoking, either by existing or new smokers, is not proved by research, although there are strong indications that it exists. The behaviour of most parties involved, including the tobacco companies, indicates that they share the belief of a link. Voluntary controls upon tobacco advertising have had some effect, in that, for example, advertising in the U.K. is no longer overtly directed at children, but various anti‐smoking lobbies believe voluntary control to be ineffective. The present British government has toyed wth the possibility of statutory control, but faces stiff opposition from back‐benchers and within the cabinet; it is also probably philosophically opposed to such measures. More research is needed into the link between advertising and smoking behaviour.",

High anger students more frequently drank alcohol, got drunk more often, and experienced more frequent and severe physical, emotional, and behavioral alcohol-related consequences than low anger students. High anger males also were more likely to feel very angry, feel like hurting someone, and do physical damage to others and to property. Whereas, high anger females reported more severe relationship consequences. When Heavy alcohol consumption by high anger students was statistically controlled, anger still contributed variance to alcohol consequences.

Nicotine found in cigarette butts may cause vomiting and neurological toxicity; leachates of cigarette butts in aquatic environments may cause exposure to additional toxic chemicals including heavy metals, ethyl phenol and pesticide residues. This report reviews published and grey literature regarding cigarette butt waste consumption by children, pets and wildlife. Although reports of human and animal exposures number in the tens of thousands, severe toxic outcomes due to butt consumption are rare. Nonetheless, the ubiquity of cigarette butt waste and its potential for adverse effects on human and animal health warrants additional research and policy interventions to reduce the stream of these pollutants in the environment.",

Les amphétamines possèdent un remarquable pouvoir éveillant, mais leurs effets secondaires importants et leur pouvoir toxicomanogène rendent leur emploi inacceptable comme éveillant. Les eugrégoriques, dont le chef de file est le modafinil, sont aussi puissants que les amphétamines pour maintenir l'éveil, bien que leur mécanisme d'action soit complètement différent.

      "title": "\"Estudio del papel modulador de las orexinas en el consumo de alcohol intensivo en \"\"atracón\"\" en ratones c57bl/6j\"",
      "abstract": "Los trastornos de la adiccion (incluido el propuesto recientemente como adiccion a la comida) han sido conceptualizados como trastornos compuestos de diferentes etapas ciclicas: atracon, retirada/efecto negativo y preocupacion/anticipacion. Estas etapas interactuan entre ellas cada vez con mas intensidad para, en ultima instancia, alcanzar el estado patologico conocido como adiccion. Para estudiar la base neurobiologica de la adiccion, tradicionalmente los estudios pre-clinicos han utilizado modelos animales que se focalizan principalmente en las etapas tardias y dependientes del ciclo de adiccion. Por el contrario, las etapas tempranas del mismo ciclo, aquellas gobernadas por el consumo en atracon anterior al estado de dependencia, han recibido menor atencion. Recientemente un modelo animal de acceso limitado a consumo de alcohol llamado “Drinking in the Dark” (DID) esta ganado aceptacion como un modelo animal robusto de consumo en atracon de alcohol que, de manera consistente, produce altos niveles de consumo de alcohol y elevadas concentraciones de alcohol en sangre farmacologicamente relevantes. Resulta interesante senalar que este paradigma ha demostrado, ademas, desencadenar consumos de atracon de otras sustancias reforzantes caloricas y no caloricas como la sacarosa y la sacarina. Este procedimiento tan util permite, por lo tanto, evaluar la base neurobiologica que subyace a las etapas tempranas del ciclo y la transicion a la dependencia.\n El sistema de Orexinas (OX) es un sistema central de neuropetidos amplicamente asociado a numerosas funciones fisiologicas como el ciclo de sueno-vigilia, la ingesta de comida o el refuerzo. Desde hace unos anos, el sistema de OX esta siendo estudiado en detalle en las etapas tardias, aquellas gobernadas por el consumo compulsivo patologico, del ciclo de adiccion a comida y droga. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha no existen evidencias experimentales evaluando el rol de este sistema de neuropeptidos en el consumo de atracon de sustancias reforzantes, incluyendo al alcohol, durante las etapas tempranas y de transicion del ciclo de adiccion. El consumo en atracon de sustancias reforzantes es modulado por cambios transitivos en diferentes sistemas cerebrales. Existe la idea de que tales neuroadaptaciones puede llegar a ser inamovibles tras episodios repetitivos de consumo en atracon, contribuyendo a un consumo excesivo y, quizas, a trastornos del consumo. Dado el rol del sistema de OX en las etapas tardias del ciclo de adiccion, el objetivo general de la presente tesis fue evaluar el rol de las OX, actuando a traves del receptor 1 de OX (OX1r) en las etapas tempranas y de transicion a la adiccion a traves del consumo en atracon de sustancias reforzantes y caloricas como el etanol y la sacarosa. Para este fin, la presente tesis evaluo los siguientes objetivos especificos en ratones C57BL/6J alimentados ad-libitum: Primero evaluamos la contribucion del OX1r al consumo excesivo en atracon de sustancias altamente reforzantes (sacarosa y sacarina) realizado mediante el paradigma de DID mediante (1) la administracion periferica de SB-334867 (0, 10, 20 or 30mg/kg), un antagonista selectivo del OX1r y; (2) la actividad mRNA de la OX en el Hipotalamo Lateral tras 4 episodios consecutivos de atracon (2h) de sustancias reforzantes (Alcaraz-Iborra et al., 2014; Capitulo 4). En segundo lugar, testamos la contribucion del OX1r al consumo excesivo en atracon de alcohol a traves de (1) una administracion icv de SB-334867 (0, 1, 3 μg/μl) en un test DID y; (2) la actividad del OX1r mRNA tras 4 episodios consecutivos de atracon (2h) de alcohol (Carvajal et al., 2015; Capitulo 5). Nuestro tercer objetivo de la presente tesis fue revisar la relevancia del sistema de OX en el marco teorico del ciclo de adiccion (Alcaraz-Iborra and Cubero, 2015. Chapter 6). Finalmente, nuestro ultimo objetivo fue evaluar los factores neurobiologicos que favorecen el aumento del riesgo de consumo de alcohol en atracon durante las etapas tempranas del ciclo de la adiccion. Para este fin evaluamos si los ratones C57BL/6J que mostraban altos consumo en atracon de alcohol en un paradigma DID (altos bebedores: HD) mostraban rasgos neurocomportamentales que contribuyen a los trastornos de consumo excesivo de alcohol a traves de la comparacion de las respuesta de ansiedad basal y la sensibilidad a las caracteristicas reforzantes del alcohol entre ratones altos bebedores y bajos bebedores (HD vs LD). Mas tarde, evaluamos la actividad basal mRNA de los receptores 1 y 2 de OX (OX1r/OX2r) en los nucleos prefrontal (PFC) y accumbens (NAc), dos areas cerebrales ampliamente implicadas en la adiccion a alcohol. Por ultimo, testamos el consumo en atracon de alcohol intermitente de los ratones HD/LD en respuesta al antagonista selectivo de OX (Alcaraz-Iborra et al., under review; Chapter 7). Nuestros resultados principales fueron: en primer lugar, una administracion ip de SB-334867 (10, 20 or 30mg/kg) disminuyo significativamente el consumo en atracon de sacarosa (10%, w/v) y sacarina (0.15%, w/v) en animales alimentados ad libitum, sin ninguna evidencia de alteracion locomotora, y (2) 4 episodios consecutivos de atracon (2h) de sacarosa y sacarina (pero no de agua) en atracon disminuyeron significativamente la actividad mRNA de la OX en el Hipotalamo Lateral (Alcaraz-Iborra et al., 2014; Capitulo 4). En segundo lugar, la administracion icv de SB-334867 (3 μg/μl) ceso el consumo en atracon en un procedimiento DID de alcohol (20% v/v), pero no el de sacarina (0.15% w/v), sin alterar el consumo de comida o las calorias totales ingeridas; ademas, la administracion icv de SB-334867 (3 μg/μl) aumento la latencia de recuperacion del reflejo de enderezarse tras una administracion sedativa de alcohol sin alterar el metabolismo periferico de alcohol, y disminuyo significativamente la actividad mRNA del OX1r en el Hipotalamo Lateral tras 4 episodios consecutivos de atracon de sacarosa, pero no de alcohol (Carvajal et al., 2015; Capitulo 5). Por ultimo, los resultados del ultimo objetivo demostraron que el paradigma DID dividia 2 endofenotipos neurocomportamentales (HD vs LD) los cuales mostraron diferencias clave en rasgos de neofobia y/o impulsividad/compulsividad sin diferencias en la respuesta a las propiedades reforzantes del alcohol y en la expresion de mRNA basal de OX1r y OX2r en el NAc y en el PFC. Ademas, estos resultados mostraron que despues de varios episodios intermitentes de alcohol en el paradigma DID, los animales LD lograban un incremento rapido del consumo de alcoho y, lo que es mas importante, los endofenotipos neurocomportamentales (HD/LD) predecian la respuesta a una administracion farmacologica con un antagonista selectivo de OX1r tras el consumo intermitente en DID (iDID) (Alcaraz-Iborra et al., under review; Capitulo 7). En resumen, los resultados actuales, combinando datos comportamentales, farmacologicos y moleculares, evidencian un rol clave del sistema de OX, especificamente del OX1r, en las etapas tempranas del ciclo y la transicion a la adicion. Dado que las OX modulan el consumo compulsivo de ambas sustancias apetecibles, la comida y el alcohol, y de acuerdo con la hipotesis que mantiene que existe un solapamiento de los mecanismos neuroquimicos en las diferentes etapas del ciclo de la adiccion, nuestros resultados nos permiten proponer la idea de que en animales vulnerables, pero no dependientes, el consumo en atracon repetitivo de sustancias reforzantes podria aumentar la transmision de OX en un bucle positivo que aumentaria la impulsividad, lo que, a su vez permite un consumo de atracon guiado por dicha impulsividad, finalmente favoreciendo la transicion a la adiccion, desde un consumo no dependiente en atracon guiado por la impulsividad, hasta un consumo compulsivo (Alcaraz-Iborra y Cubero, 2015; Capitulo 6). En este contexto, en el que existe la idea de que el sistema de OX podria ser reclutado en las etapas tempranas del ciclo de adiccion, los receptores de OX pueden representar una diana terapeutica que ayude a prevenir episodios repetitivos de atracon de sustancias reforzantes (incluyendo la comida palatable, el alcohol y las demas drogas) para que evolucionen en consumos patologicos compulsivos a lo largo del tiempo.",

It improves performance and endurance during prolonged, exhaustive exercise. To a lesser degree it also enhances short-term, high-intensity athletic performance. Caffeine improves concentration, reduces fatigue, and enhances alertness. Habitual intake does not diminish caffeine's ergogenic properties. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the physiologic effects of caffeine, but adenosine receptor antagonism most likely accounts for the primary mode of action. It is relatively safe and has no known negative performance effects, nor does it cause significant dehydration or electrolyte imbalance during exercise. Routine caffeine consumption may cause tolerance or dependence, and abrupt discontinuation produces irritability, mood shifts, headache, drowsiness, or fatigue. Major sport governing bodies ban excessive use of caffeine, but current monitoring techniques are inadequate, and ethical dilemmas persist regarding caffeine intake by athletes.",

      "abstract": "O uso de drogas no Brasil, lícitas e ilícitas, é um grave problema de saúde pública. O III Levantamento Nacional sobre o Uso de Drogas revela que 66,4% dos brasileiros entre 12 e 65 anos já consumiram álcool, e 33,5% já usaram tabaco, com alta prevalência entre adolescentes. Além disso, 15 milhões de indivíduos admitiram o uso de drogas ilícitas. Entretanto, o uso, abuso e dependência de drogas, apesar de frequentemente usados como sinônimos, têm definições distintas. O consumo abusivo pode evoluir para o Transtorno de Uso de Substâncias (TUS), que envolve a perda de controle sobre o consumo e a compulsão pela droga. Fatores genéticos, ambientais e as características da substância influenciam na vulnerabilidade ao vício. Este artigo discute a neuroquímica das drogas de abuso, destacando o papel da dopamina e do sistema de recompensa no desenvolvimento da adicção, além de discutir três das principais drogas utilizadas no Brasil, o álcool, a nicotina e a cocaína/crack. A compreensão desses mecanismos é essencial para enfrentar os desafios associados ao consumo de drogas no Brasil.",

      "title": "Smoking Cessation: What to Tell Patients about Over-the-Counter Treatments",
      "abstract": "Mr. T, age 56, has major depressive disorder that is well controlled with fluoxetine, 40 mg/d. He has smoked [greater than or equal to] 1 packs of cigarettes per day for last 25 years. On a recent visit, he indicates that he has begun using a 21-mg nicotine patch as advised by his pharmacist and that things are going OK, although he has had some slip ups. He is on week 7 of his quitting regimen and now is stepping down patch dosage. Upon further questioning he says that he has been cutting 21-mg patches in half to save money. Mr. T also explains that occasionally he has given in to a strong urge to smoke because it was too much to handle. He states that he does not think this is a big deal because he uses electronic cigarettes and has heard that these products don't contain the bad cancer stuff. At end of Mr. T's visit, he asks for something to help him sleep because has been unable to sleep consistently and has been having vivid dreams since starting patch. He also wants to know how to reduce itching from patch. Approximately 46 million Americans smoke and cigarette smoking accounts for 1 of every 5 deaths in United States each year. (1) Since advent of Stop Smoking campaigns, bans on smoking in public buildings, over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement products, and Surgeon General recommendations, discussing smoking cessation with patients has become standard practice. Research suggests that treatment to quit smoking should include a combination of pharmacotherapy and counseling, such as cognitive-behavioral strategies, support groups, and quitting hotlines. (2) Pharmacotherapy consists of OTC nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products and prescription medications. This article briefly highlights how to counsel patients about using OTC NRT products (Table, page 44). (2-5) Visit this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com for a table that highlights prescription smoking cessation agents. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Patches Nicotine replacement patches are best used for maintenance treatment of nicotine cravings. They deliver a fixed amount of nicotine over 24 hours. (3) Patches have a specially formulated transdermal matrix system and should not be cut. Doing so damages drug delivery system and could lead to drug evaporation from cut edges. (4) Mr. T's psychiatrist advises him not to cut patches but instead purchase 14-mg patch because he is at this step of smoking cessation regimen. Skin irritation caused by adhesive is a common adverse event from nicotine patches. Rotating location of each patch to a different hairless body area is best way to prevent or combat skin irritation. If rotating location of patch does not relieve irritation, patients can apply a thin layer of an OTC hydrocortisone 1% cream to affected site 2 to 4 times a day after gently washing area. (5) Instruct patients to avoid using occlusive dressings over topical application. Nicotine replacement patches also have been reported to cause vivid dreams and insomnia. (3) These side effects may be caused by nighttime nicotine absorption which might be avoided by switching to a different NRT product or removing 24-hour patch when going to bed. (4) Combining treatments Many patients experience nicotine cravings while using nicotine replacement patch. Stressful situations and events can trigger a patient's desire for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms that a patch that delivers a continuous amount of nicotine over 24 hours cannot alleviate. Combining different forms of treatment could combat these symptoms. (2), (3), (5) Combination therapy might consist of using sustained-release bupropion or a nicotine patch with rapid-acting NRT products such as a lozenge, gum, nasal spray, or inhaler. In Mr. T's case, clinicians recommend that he use nicotine polacrilex gum in addition to patch to quell his cravings. …",

      "title": "Consequences of acute and long‐term excessive iodine intake: A literature review focusing on seaweed as a potential dietary iodine source",
      "abstract": "Abstract Macroalgae, also called seaweed, are becoming more widespread as food in Western diets. Seaweed can accumulate iodine, an essential nutrient for humans. However, some species of seaweed may contain very high amounts of iodine, and therefore, iodine has been identified as one of the major hazards in the seaweed food chain. Macroalgae may be consumed regularly, though many consumers report eating macroalgae only occasionally. The aim of this paper is to explore possible health consequences of excessive iodine intake according to long‐term (chronic) or occasional (acute) excessive exposure to iodine, relating to a regular (chronic) or occasional (acute) seaweed intake, respectively. Furthermore, through a modeling exercise, we add different amounts of seaweed to the diet in a population group to explore the possible safe amounts that can be added without exceeding excessive iodine intakes and risking detrimental health effects. Chronic excessive iodine intakes were associated with several negative health outcomes at variable doses in various studies. For acute excessive iodine exposure, negative health effects seemed to be associated with higher iodine exposures. However, the research on this topic was limited. The chronic and acute iodine exposures needed to result in negative health outcomes may easily be ingested by macroalgae consumption. Adding seaweed to the diet must be done thoughtfully to avoid the risk of exceeding thresholds for excessive iodine intake.",

Por consiguiente el proyecto de investigacion se basa en la implementacion de estrategias comunicacionales con el proposito de informar a los jovenes los problemas que conllevan el uso de estas sustancias por medio de mensajes. Una vez que ya pudimos investigar sobre las causas y consecuencias, como principal causa que conlleva al joven a ingerir este tipo de sustancias es la presion social, vivimos en un mundo donde lo malo es bueno, muchos de estos jovenes optan por consumir drogas para ser aceptado en un determinado grupo, venir de familias desordenas es otra causa de que los jovenes buscan refugiarse en las drogas, partiendo de estas causas podemos encontrar muchas que como consecuencia principal tenemos la adiccion a este tipo de sustancias, muchos de estos jovenes cuando ya estan con este problema optan por ir a la delincuencia para obtener estas sustancias ya que no cuentan con un estado economico estable. La investigacion se lo ha enfocado en tecnicas de difusion de informacion para un correcto posicionamiento de mensaje que ayuden a prevenir que el estudiante recurra a estas sustancias, un correcto manejo de informacion, color, planos, tipografia ayudaran a que los estudiantes esten mas informados sobre los problemas que causan el consumo de drogas ayudara a que tomen conciencia y piensen si lo que van hacer es bueno o malo para su salud, despues de realizar la investigacion se pudo plantear el desarrollo de estrategias de comunicacion, el cual consiste mediante estrategias informar a los jovenes los diferentes problemas que tiene el consumir drogas y que las mismas sean recordadas con el pasar del tiempo.

They need to know about changes that take place when they are active or when they are ill, and to understand the reasons why they should keep themselves clean, eat well and have regular exercise. If they feel confident with these things and comfortable with their bodies, then they will grow in self-esteem and feel good about themselves as individuals.

      "abstract": "Author(s): Cummings, Jenna Rosemarie | Advisor(s): Tomiyama, Ayako J. | Abstract: People engage in multiple behaviors that affect their health. There is little research on how these behaviors intersect within a person’s life. In this dissertation, I hypothesized that behaviors that activate the neural reward system can “compete.” In Study 1, I experimentally tested if eating sweet high-fat foods acutely reduced alcohol cravings for heavy drinking adults. I found that eating sweet high-fat foods acutely reduced alcohol cravings no more than watching a neutral video. In Study 2, I observed multiple reward-related behaviors (e.g., self-affirmation, social interactions, exercise) and health-compromising behaviors (e.g., unhealthy eating, alcohol use) within the everyday lives of young adults via a 4-day ambulatory electronic diary. I found that when young adults engaged in multiple reward-related behaviors they were more likely to eat unhealthy foods in the next hour. However, when young adults engaged in reward-related behaviors that provided a sense of accomplishment they were less likely to drink alcohol in the next hour. These studies fill scientific gaps in understanding intersections between reward-related behaviors and provide insight for health behavior change. Namely, that “replacing” health-compromising behavior with other reward-related behaviors may not consistently work.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a feeling of loss of interest or pleasure, sadness, feelings of guilt or inferiority, disturbances in sleep or appetite, feelings of tiredness, and poor concentration and the desire to end life. In Indonesia, according to the Indonesian Ministry of Health in 2018, the prevalence of depressive disorders in Indonesia is 6.1%. Based on the 2013 Riskesdas report, the prevalence of suicide in Indonesia is mostly carried out by women, which is around 0.8% compared to men, which has a prevalence of 0.6%. Until now, the first line of depression therapy is the Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitor (SSRI) group. Although this drug is effective in improving symptoms of depression, this drug can cause several side effects such as insomnia or drowsiness, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. Therefore, we need an alternative medicine that can replace conventional medicine which has less side effects. Cinnamon is one of the many plants found in Indonesia which is believed to have the potential to overcome various diseases. Based on previous research, there are many active components contained in cinnamon that have anti-depressant effects. Active components such as Phenol, Cinnamaldehyde, Turmerone, Proanthocyanidin and Linalool as well as Eugenol can provide anti-depressant effects through anti-inflammatory prevention.",

      "abstract": "Com o fácil acesso às medicações e o crescimento de seu consumo de forma deliberada, o armazenamento de grandes quantidades de medicamentos em domicilio tende a ser grande contribuindo para o vencimento por desuso de muitas medicações adquiridas em virtude de alguma afecção aguda, trazendo a necessidade de descarte dos medicamentos vencidos ou não mais necessários. Entretanto, quando realizado no lixo comum ou no esgoto contaminam água e solo sendo praticamente impossível de ser eliminados em processos de filtração e tratamento comum. Foram aplicados questionários, de forma aleatória, na cidade de Colatina/ES e os dados foram analisados de forma a verificar os erros mais comuns em relação ao descarte dos medicamentos e a quais características da população estes se associavam. Constatou-se que 100% dos entrevistados possuíam medicações em domicílio. Observou-se também a falta de conhecimento a respeito da Política de Nacional de Resíduos Sólidos ou de qualquer informação acerca das formas adequadas de descarte de medicamentos. 83% dos participantes utilizam o descarte no lixo comum e, ainda, mais da metade nunca pensaram nos maleficios causados por essa forma de descarte. A respeito da responsabilidade ambiental, 25% dos entrevistados alegaram nunca ter pensado a respeito dos problemas ambientais que essa prática pode gerar. Tendo em vista os resultados apresentados é possível extrair duas informações principais: a falta de conhecimento da população acerca dos malefícios causados pelo descarte indevido de medicamentos e sua alta taxa de descarte de forma inadequada faz-se, portanto, necessárias medidas de intervenção para inversão da situação.",

      "abstract": "L'utilisation de substances récréatives a pris au cours de ces dernières années des proportions épidémiques tant au niveau mondial qu'au niveau national. Parmi les différentes substances, l'alcool possède une position particulière dans la mesure où contrairement aux autres substances, une consommation modérée peut avoir certains effets bénéfiques. La cocaïne, les amphétamines et l'ecstasy ont toutes pour principal effet cardiovasculaire délétère d'entraîner une stimulation majeure du système sympathique conduisant à différents degrés de tachycardie, et de vasoconstriction dont l'expression clinique dépend tout aussi bien de la dose ingérée, de l'existence d'une pathologie préalable que de l'organe considéré. L'héroïne, à l'inverse, stimule le système parasympathique avec pour conséquence la possibilité de bradycardie et d'hypotension. Quant au cannabis, ses effets cardiovasculaires apparaissent dépendants de la dose ingérée et surtout de phénomène d'accoutumance important. L'ensemble de ces manifestations cardiovasculaires est important à garder à l'esprit, même si le contexte d'intoxication aux substances récréatives n'est pas évident. Over the past years, the trend of recreational drugs abuse is on an epidemic increase worldwide but also in our own country. Among these conditions, alcohol has a specific position because a moderate intake has been proven to be beneficial on the cardiovascular system. In contrast, cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy have major deleterious side-effects (i.e.: tachycardia and vasoconstriction) as a consequence of a stimulation of the sympathetic system; these effects are depending on the amount of drug ingested but also on the existence of associated underlying pathophysiological conditions. Conversely, heroin increases the parasympathetic tone with possible bradycardia and hypotension. Finally, the cardiovascular side-effects of cannabis are not only dose-dependent but also related to the degree of addiction. All these symptoms should be kept in mind even when the context of recreational drugs abuse is not obvious.",

There are a vast range of AAS substances illegally available, the nature of their true composition is difficult to evaluate. Users follow dosing patterns which incorporate a number of different AASs, in addition to other pharmaceutical substances believed to complement the desired physical effects or manage unwanted effects. Animal work and medical case reports suggest potential to cause serious hepatotoxicity, plus possible neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and damage to the cardiovascular and reproductive systems. As the long-term AASs users reach maturity, further controlled experimentation, with larger sample sizes, is required. Data gathering should be directed towards the most vulnerable group of AAS users, females and adolescent boys.",

      "title": "Commentary on Brose <i>et al</i>. (2015): Protecting individual and public health by regulating electronic cigarette nicotine delivery",
      "abstract": "Brose and colleagues 1 used a national data set from Great Britain to demonstrate that, in current tobacco cigarette smokers, daily but not non-daily electronic cigarette (e-cig) use shows a significant association with increased tobacco smoking cessation attempts and reductions in smoking behavior. However, e-cig use was not shown in this study to be associated significantly with tobacco smoking cessation. Taken together, this new study 1 and the extant literature (e.g. 2, 3) provide little empirical support for the contention that e-cig use leads reliably to smoking cessation for the majority of users. Tobacco cigarette smokers self-administer the stimulant drug nicotine with every puff that they inhale, and most of them are dependent on the drug 4. This dependence makes cessation difficult, in part because of an aversive abstinence syndrome that occurs during a cessation attempt (e.g. 5). Nicotine replacement medications act by delivering nicotine to the user and thus suppressing at least some aversive abstinence symptoms: the more nicotine, the greater the symptom suppression (e.g. 6). E-cigs are not marketed as medications in many countries, but are a class of products that use an electric heater to aerosolize a liquid that usually contains some combination of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavorants and nicotine. Despite not being marketed as medications, many smokers are attempting to quit tobacco cigarettes by using e-cigs daily; however, there is little information regarding the long-term health risks associated with daily e-cig use. Putting aside that concern, if daily e-cig use is to lead to smoking cessation for the majority of users, then e-cigs will probably need to deliver nicotine in doses necessary to suppress abstinence symptoms as effectively as a tobacco cigarette. Unfortunately, there is wide variability in e-cig nicotine delivery: 10 puffs from an e-cig may, for example 7, or may not 8, result in reliable nicotine delivery to the user's blood. Differences across studies can be explained by a combination of factors, including characteristics of the e-cig device and liquid, as well as user behavior 9. Those e-cig device/liquid combinations that are most likely to lead to smoking cessation may well be those that approximate the nicotine delivery profile of a tobacco cigarette (e.g. 10). Strangely, e-cigs that are far less effective at delivering nicotine continue to be marketed to smokers. For instance, 50 puffs from either of two Blu e-cig (Lorillard, Inc., Greensboro, NC, USA) models that are currently available on the US market deliver 23–53% less nicotine to the user relative to approximately 10 puffs from a conventional tobacco cigarette 11, yet Blu e-cig brands are rated as the most popular among US young adults 12. Perhaps relatedly, more than 80% of all US televised e-cig advertisements geared toward youth and young adults were for Blu e-cigs 13, and 90% of all US advertising expenditures for e-cig brands have been for Blu E e-cigs 14. The fact that some e-cigs that are advertised to youth and young adults actively also deliver very little nicotine is reminiscent of so-called ‘starter products’ common in the smokeless tobacco arena 15. Starter products allow nicotine-naive users to self-administer low doses of nicotine without experiencing drug-mediated adverse side effects and then, as tolerance develops, these users can ‘graduate’ to products that deliver increasing doses of the drug (e.g. 15). Public health policy-makers may want to recall this industry strategy when considering regulatory action regarding e-cigs. Further complicating this issue is that at least 466 distinct brands of e-cigs are marketed currently 16, some by major tobacco companies. Tobacco companies in particular may be interested in smokers who purchase an e-cig as part of a smoking cessation strategy but, as Brose et al.’s 1 data suggest, ultimately do not quit smoking, perhaps because the e-cig they bought underperforms a tobacco cigarette in terms of nicotine delivery to the user. Under this scenario, the tobacco company that sells the under-performing product profits from sales of e-cigs and tobacco cigarettes, while the smoker who purchased the under-performing product in addition to tobacco cigarettes continues to be at risk for tobacco-caused disease and death. Much has been written about the potential for e-cigs to provide public health benefit through a dramatic reduction in tobacco cigarette smoking (e.g. 17). This potential benefit may require science-based regulatory intervention to ensure that e-cigs deliver nicotine effectively to cigarette smokers, while avoiding e-cig-induced nicotine dependence in non-smokers via the starter product strategy. Also, some e-cig device/liquid combinations on the market today may deliver nicotine more effectively than the highly addictive tobacco cigarette 18; there is no clear public health rationale for such products, and regulation can help to limit their availability. Relevant foci for regulatory intervention that address drug delivery include product characteristics 9 and nicotine flux 19. Without meaningful, science-based regulation, there may be many future opportunities to report, as do Brose et al. 1, that e-cigs are not effective tools for helping the majority of smokers to quit using lethal tobacco cigarettes.

      "abstract": "O consumo abusivo de alcool representa um grave problema de saude publica, sendo considerado um dos principais factores de mortalidade e morbilidade, afectando de forma significativa o funcionamento fisico e psiquico dos individuos. Sabe-se que mediante o tipo de consumo, a duracao e o inicio do mesmo, assim variam os danos no funcionamento cognitivo, o que tem consequencias no quotidiano de cada individuo. As consequencias do consumo no funcionamento cognitivo podem condicionar ate o processo terapeutico, nomeadamente a inibicao de comportamentos automaticos de consumo, a flexibilidade cognitiva para substituir comportamentos de consumo por outros mais ajustados, a capacidade para definir objectivos, que nao envolvam a recompensa imediata, entre outros. Por outro lado, coloca-se cada vez mais a hipotese da existencia de alguma vulnerabilidade, nos dependentes de alcool, destacando-se alguma fragilidade nos processos cognitivos, que podem conduzir ao desenvolvimento de comportamentos aditivos. Assim, deve existir a preocupacao de desenvolver programas reabilitativos, que integrem a intervencao nos aspectos emocionais, cognitivos e comportamentais, regendo-se pelo conceito da neuroplasticiadade. Desta forma, foi desenvolvido um projecto de Reabilitacao Cognitiva, na UTRA, que se destina a utentes com alteracoes moderadas a graves a nivel cognitivo, visando maximizar ou recuperar as funcoes cognitivas, de modo a atenuar o sofrimento e sentimento de inadequacao, promovendo o bem-estar e qualidade de vida, bem como prevencao de recaidas. Este programa tem a duracao de tres meses, integrando uma vertente multidimensional, que inclui a Consciencia do Defice; Gestao de Emocoes/Treino de Competencias Sociais /Comportamento; Treino Cognitivo. The abusive consumption of alcohol represents a serious problem of public health, considered as a main factor of mortality and morbidity; it meaningfully affects physical and psychological functioning of the individual. It is known that the extension of the damages on cognitive behavior depends on the type, length and beginning of the consumption and that has consequences in the daily activities each individual. The consequences of consumption on cognitive behavior are passive of affecting the terapeuthical process, namely the inhibition of automatic behaviors of inhibiting consumption, to cognitive flexibility to substitute consumption behaviors for other more adjusted or to the capacity to set other goals rather than automatic reward. On the other hand, each time more importance is given to the existence of some vulnerability on alcohol addicts, highlighting some fragility in cognitive processes, which can lead to the development of additive behaviors. Therefore, there must be a concern in the development of rehabilitation programs able to integrate emotional, cognitive and behavioral aspects based on the concept of neuroplasticity. This way, a Cognitive Rehabilitation project has been developed at UTRA intended for users with moderate to severe changes on cognitive level, aiming to maximize or recover cognitive functions, in order to attenuate suffering and feeling of not belonging, promoting well-being or quality of life to prevent relapse. This program will last three months and will integrate a multidimensional dimension including Deficit Awareness, Emotional Management/Training of Social/Behavioral Cognitive Skills.

Waehrend der Anteil der Alkoholunfaelle leicht abnimmt, steigen Unfaelle mit Drogen- und Medikamentenbeteiligung an. Blutuntersuchungen von verkehrsauffaelligen Autofahrern weisen Rauschgiftanteile zwischen 14 und 25 Prozent auf. Cannabis fuehrt zu einer Verringerung der Konzentration und zur Erhoehung der Risikobereitschaft. Aus einer Umfrage geht hervor, dass mehr als ein Viertel der 21- bis 24-Jaehrigen schon Cannabis konsumiert hat. Nicht vergessen werden duerfen Medikamente mit drogenaehnlichen Wirkungen. Lediglich Alkohol laesst sich einfach nachweisen. Bei Medikamenten ist nicht nur die Laboranalyse langwierig und zeitaufwaendig, sondern es gibt auch das Problem, dass diverse Abbauprodukte selbst halluzinogene Wirkungen erzeugen. Noch schwieriger ist der Nachweis bei Betaeubungs- und Rauschmitteln. Cannabis kann beispielsweise noch nach 2 Wochen im Harn nachgewiesen werden. Damit ist aber ueber die Fahrtuechtigkeit ueberhaupt nichts ausgesagt. Tetrahydrocannabinol ist stark fettloeslich und wird rasch im fettreichen Gewebe des Koerpers aufgenommen und von dort nur sehr langsam freigesetzt. Cannabis kann auch in den Haaren, im Speichel und im Schweiss nachgewiesen werden. Dafuer gibt es allerdings noch keine sicheren und genauen Apparate. Besonders schwierig wird der Nachweis bei einer Multiintoxikation. Bei Medikamenten sind es vor allem die Benzodiazepine, die die Verkehrstuechtigkeit negativ beeinflussen. Es ist noch wesentlich mehr Wissen ueber die Wirkung der einzelnen Substanzen und ueber das Zusammenwirken der Substanzen notwendig.

      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction remains a popular yet controversial construct, which proposes that overeating and obesity arise from the consumption of “addictive” foods. This model rests on the assumption that foods, or their constituent macronutrients, elicit pharmacological effects on the brain analogous to those produced by addictive drugs. However, there has been no critical examination of whether the key pharmacological characteristics of addictive substances truly extend to food. In this chapter, we consider if two proposed addictive components of food, sugar and dietary fat, recapitulate the pharmacological properties of drugs, such as their impact on mesolimbic dopamine release. We find no convincing evidence to support the classification of sugar or dietary fats as addictive substances, particularly as addictive-like consumption in animals arises from orosensory effects alone. We caution against the implementation of food addiction as an explanation for disordered eating.",

Life has to do with maintaining the functions of biological systems.  Organisms must be healthy to maintain their life. Health is a perfect working condition of the body. Disease is a divergence from normal physiological conditions of the organism in question. The cause of most diseases can be traced to physiology and its effect on humans. Obesity is one of the contemporary diseases that are psychologically tied. For this reason, some clinical applications have been used, including exercise, diet and some surgical methods. However, alternative remedies are been applied and they include herbal therapy, hunger, aromatherapy, musical, color and magnet therapies, yoga and acupuncture amongst others for one to stay healthy. The above examples are referred to as naturopathy. Hunger is a psychological stimulus and not a pathological condition. When the glycogen level in the liver or glucose in the blood falls below a ratio, this is usually followed by a desire to eat. The often unpleasant feeling originates in the hypothalamus. Hunger is seen in different religions of the world as a rule.  Hunger, as a cure or remedy to diseases, has been used at different times because of its numerous advantages. In some cases, hunger makes one to be contented, and patient with life; it also brings about good health, as staying hungry can help one to fight against obesity. Using hunger as a form of treatment to stay healthy should not be considered at any time as torture.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tKey words: Philosophy of life, health, disease, naturopathy, human.",

      "abstract": "Anorectic agents constitute the most widely used supportive drug treatment in obesity as well as that most often prescribed. A large number of substances have been proposed for this purpose, and some have been found to be reasonably effective, while others exhibiting side effects which forbid their use, as thyroid hormones and diuretic agents. There are other substances with properties that might justify their use, such as ballast preparations, some antidepressive agents, and a few compounds acting principally on the gastrointestinal tract. Of current interest are substances furthering thermogenesis, but for the time being these remain in the realm of pure research. The anorectic agents usually available bring about a weight loss of about 0.5 lb (0.230 kg) per week more than prescription of a placebo, though only over a limited period of time. Once the drug is discontinued, weight regain is the rule and it appears even that association of an anorectic agent to behavioural therapy might have an unfavourable effect on maintenance of the weight loss. Their use is therefore difficult to justify except in the rare cases where a short-term reduction in weight is desired or in patients suffering from an illness linked to their overweight. Differences in eating habits observed with amphetamines compared with fenfluramine and its dextrorotatory isomer dexfenfluramine suggest that these compounds could play a supportive role in the management of obese patients along with the dietetic training and changes in eating habits which are still fundamental to the medical treatment of obesity.",

Low birth weight babies are more likely to die and are more prone to illness, respiratory problems, and long-term health issues as adults. The more cigarettes you smoke during your pregnancy, the more likely you are to have complications and a baby with a low birth weight. There is no strong evidence, however, that reducing the amount or strength of cigarettes you smoke decreases the risks to the foetus.

Gesicherte Angaben zur schädigenden Wirkung auf die Mutter bzw. den Schwangerschaftsverlauf und den Feten existieren vor allem für Alkohol, Cannabis, Cocain, Opiate und Tabak. Die Daten weisen für viele Drogen gemeinsam auf die Gefahr von plazentaren Durchblutungsstörungen hin, die sich in Mangelentwicklung, Wachstumsretardierung, vorzeitiger Wehentätigkeit, Früh- oder Totgeburt manifestieren können. Bei mehreren Drogen beschrieben sind postnatale Effekte in Form von motorischen und vor allem intellektuellen Entwicklungsstörungen.

Sie dienen aber als Orientierungshilfe bei der ausgedehnten Fehlbildungsdiagnostik, die in jedem Fall angezeigt ist. Erschwerend dürfte die Tatsache sein, dass selten nur eine Droge konsumiert wird, sondern meistens ein Mischkonsum vorliegt. Neben allen potentiellen Wirkungen darf bei der Betreuung einer Drogen konsumierenden Schwangeren zudem nicht unbeachtet bleiben, dass der Allgemeinzustand der Schwangeren oftmals erheblich reduziert und besonders bei i.v.

      "abstract": "What Is Ritalin Abuse? Methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta) is the common treatment for attention defi cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition affecting 3–5 percent of the U.S. population. Ritalin is occasionally prescribed for narcolepsy. In recent years, Ritalin has become one of the most abused prescription drugs. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifi es Ritalin as a schedule 2 drug, a substance with a large potential for misuse. Street terms for Ritalin include “vitamin R,” “R ball,” and “cramming drug.” Prescribed Ritalin costs 25–50 cents per tablet. Ritalin’s street value may be as much as $2 to $20 per 20 milligram tablet. Whereas college students once drank excessive amounts of coffee or took caffeine pills to stay awake while cramming for tests, many now use Ritalin to remain alert. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Ritalin can allow students to stay awake for many hours in a row and maintain abnormally high levels of concentration. Students have used it to cram for as long as a few days. Monitoring the Future reports a drop-off in annual prevalence of nonmedical Ritalin use of more than half after age 24, lending support to arguments that students are using it as a “study drug.” Some students use Ritalin so they can consume more alcohol or mix it with other drugs to prolong partying. 7, 8 Although some students take Ritalin tablets whole, others pursue stronger stimulation by crushing tablets and snorting them. Still others grind the tablets, mix them with water, “cook” them, and inject the mix intravenously. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bans Ritalin, except for medical exceptions, and the U.S. Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee also ban the stimulant.",

A pesar de que casi todos los ninos con problemas de alimentacion tienen alguna condicion biologica, la mayoria de los programas de intervencion se centran en los componentes conductuales. Los terminos «rechazo a alimentarse» y «selectividad alimentaria» parecen implicar que se trata de comportamientos voluntarios cuando, en realidad, es muy probable que se deban a problemas medicos o sensoriomotores no identificados que transforman el proceso de alimentarse en algo dificil o doloroso.

When problems of food refusal and selectivity persist, children are at risk for nutritional deficiencies. Although most children with eating disorders have a biological condition, most intervention programs focus on behavioral components. The terms food refusal and food selectivity seem to imply that these are voluntary behaviors when in fact they are very likely due to unidentified medical or sensorimotor issues which transform the process of feeding into something difficult or painful. This paper aims to provide a review of the factors to consider in the evaluation and treatment of the child who refuses to eat or is overly selective in accepting food.",

De hábito en los años 60, el consumo pasó a ser considerado como dependencia psicológica en los años 70, después como adicción en los 80 y en los años 90 se instauró la clínica del fumador. Para entender el mecanismo del hábito de fumar debemos considerar que fumar representa mucho más que la dependencia física a la nicotina. Con el paso del tiempo el fumador pasa a recibir estímulos sociales, comportamentales o culturales que refuerzan su hábito y probablemente serán los elementos causantes del establecimiento de la dependencia psicológica. Tanto el componente psicológico como el físico de la dependencia al tabaco tienen un papel fundamental en el mantenimiento del hábito.",

Prick skin testings with available food allergens only revealed a positive reaction to a 1:10 w/v of wheat flour extract. A diagnosis of wheat-induced anaphylaxis was made and a double blind food challenge was suggested however was declined by the family. The patient was instructed to avoid all wheat containing foods and to carry a kit containing an epinephrine pre-loaded syringe and an antihistamine tablet to be used in the event of inadvertant consumption with an instruction to seek medical assistance as soon as possible. Thus far, no further recurrence of anaphylaxis was encountered. A review of the current literature discloses that wheat-induced anaphylaxis is an uncommon event and could occur either immediately after the ingestion or with a concomitant exercise. The natural history of wheat allergy is currently not fully understood but may possibly be a life long event.",

Dopamine is not only a key regulator of learning and motivation, but also a core substance that regulates the human body. Depression and Parkinson's disease are often associated with a lack of dopamine. Moreover, smoking is addictive, and its main mechanism is also closely related to dopamine: nicotine can cause a burst of dopamine neurons. Another substance with similar effects to dopamine is endorphins. Endorphins attach to morphine receptors and cause the same pain alleviation and pleasure that morphine and other opiates do, similar to a sense of accomplishment. Endorphins bring pleasure, but also lead to drug abuse. Opiate addiction is a severe public health issue that affects a huge proportion of population. People who take drugs produce dopamine and endorphins, and their mental dependence on drugs far exceeds the benefits of dopamine and endorphins.",

Evidence from studies published so far suggests that dietary restrictions are in fact effective only in the treatment of specific food allergies, not in allergy prevention. An elimination diet of a child or a breastfeeding mother entails a risk to normal nutrition and growth of the child. Although studies are lacking, dietary restrictions during lactation may well be harmful also to the mother's health. Substitution of nutritionally important foods and professional guidance are necessary for the successful treatment of food allergies.",

      "title": "Nicotine as an Addictive Substance: A Critical Examination of the Basic Concepts and Empirical Evidence",
      "abstract": "The present review is a critical analysis of the concepts behind and the empirical data supporting the view that tobacco use represents an addiction to nicotine. It deals with general aspects of the notion of addiction, while concentrating on specific problems associated with incorporating nicotine into current frameworks. The notion of addiction suffers from unprecedented definitional difficulties. The definitions offered by various authorities are very different, even contradictory. Definitions that reasonably include nicotine are so broad and vague that they allow many trivial things, such as salt, sugar, and watching television, to be considered addictive. Definitions that exclude the trivia also exclude nicotine. The addiction hypothesis, in general, is strongly shaped by views that certain drugs bring about a molecular level subversion of rationality. The main human evidence for this is verbal reports of smokers who say that they can't quit. On the other hand, the existence of many millions of successful quitters suggests that most people can quit. Some smokers don't quit, but whether they can't is another matter. The addiction hypothesis would be greatly strengthened by the demonstration that any drug of abuse produces special changes in the brain. It has yet to be shown that any drug produces changes in the brain different from those produced by many innocuous substances and events. The effects of nicotine on the brain are similar to those of sugar, salt, exercise, and other harmless substances and events. Apart from numerous conceptual and definitional inadequacies with the addiction concept in general, the notion that nicotine is addictive lacks reasonable empirical support. Nicotine does not have the properties of reference drugs of abuse. There are so many findings that conflict so starkly with the view that nicotine is addictive that it increasingly appears that adhering to the nicotine addiction thesis is only defensible on extra-scientific grounds.",

It can be addictive and the risk increases the earlier it is used. Early and frequent use also increases the risk of short-term cognitive impairment and under performing in school, as well as psychotic symptoms and disorders. Cannabis use significantly impairs coordination and reaction time, so it is not surprising that it is the most common illicit drug found to be involved in car accidents, including fatal ones. And although we do not know the full extent of the impact of early cannabis use on long-term cognitive ability and associated educational and occupational successes, evidence is mounting that cannabis affects the young brain in a harmful way that cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nThis report presents an immediate opportunity to enhance youth drug use prevention and intervention programs, as well as emerging policy frameworks, with factual information and in a fashion that has been shown to work. We know that cannabis is not a benign substance. It has clear harms and poses risks to those who use it on a regular and frequent basis, including negative health, economic and social ramifications. It is now up to readers to take the information in this report and use it to help reduce the incidence of harms associated with cannabis use among adolescents, to help young people make smarter and more informed choices about their todays and their tomorrows.",

      "abstract": "With the increased use of cannabis in the medicinal and recreational domains, it is becoming more important for physicians to better understand its harmful and beneficial effects. Although medical cannabis comes in several forms, the preferred route of administration is smoking or inhalation. After caring for three asthmatic patients who were treated with medical cannabis and who reported improvement in their symptoms, we decided to review the available data on the effects of medical cannabis on asthmatic patients.To review the known effects of medical cannabis on asthmatic patients.A thorough search was conducted of the MEDLINE and PubMed databases as well as the internet for publications about the effects of medical cannabis on asthmatic patients.Cannabis has a bronchodilator effect on the airways and might have an anti-inflammatory effect on asthmatic patients. However, harmful effects on the lungs are mainly attributed to smoking and include airway irritation and the development of chronic bronchitis symptoms.Cannabis has some benefit, yet there are many harmful effects on the lungs. Additional research is needed to determine the harmful effects of vaporizers as well as inhalers.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that light to moderate amounts of polyphenol-rich alcoholic beverages like wine or beer could have health benefits. Scientists have long debated the effects of alcohol on immune function, showing on the one hand, that high doses of alcohol consumption can directly suppress a wide range of immune responses, and that alcohol abuse is associated with an increased incidence of a number of infectious diseases. On the other hand, moderate alcohol consumption seems to have a beneficial impact on the immune system compared to alcohol abuse or abstinence. Therefore, the link between alcohol consumption, immune response, as well as infectious and inflammatory processes remains not completely understood. With this in mind, it is important to realise that other factors, unrelated or indirectly related to immune function, like drinking patterns, beverage type, amount of alcohol, or gender differences, will affect the influence that alcohol consumption may have on the immune system. This review summarises published data describing the effects that light to moderate amounts of polyphenol-rich beverages like wine or beer seem to have on immunity in healthy adults.",

A questionnaire-based descriptive epidemiological study was conducted at three major universities of Lahore, Pakistan. Among the target population that fell in the age ranging from 18-28 years, 35% started consuming caffeinated drinks between the ages 10-15, while tea was consumed by 60% of the sample population. 50% consume caffeinated drinks once or twice a day whereas 60% could refrain from consuming a single drink per day. 38.5% stated to suffer from increased urination while 22% suffered from increased blood pressure upon consumption. Caffeine addiction is one of the most prevalent and ever-expanding addictions in the world which must be either eliminated from diet or replaced by a healthier alternative.",

      "title": "The effects of fasting on metabolism and performance",
      "abstract": "An overnight fast of 8–10 h is normal for most people. Fasting is characterised by a coordinated set of metabolic changes designed to spare carbohydrate and increase reliance on fat as a substrate for energy supply. As well as sparing the limited endogenous carbohydrate, and increased rate of gluconeogenesis from amino acids, glycerol and ketone bodies help maintain the supply of carbohydrate. Many individuals undergo periodic fasts for health, religious or cultural reasons. Ramadan fasting, involving 1 month of abstention from food and fluid intake during daylight hours, is practised by a large part of the world population. This period involves a shift in the pattern of intake from daytime to the hours of darkness. There seems to be little effect on overall daily dietary intake and only small metabolic effects, but there may be implications for both physical and cognitive function. The limited evidence suggests that effects of Ramadan-style fasting on exercise performance are generally small. This needs to be balanced, however, against the observation that small differences in performance are critical in determining the outcomes of sporting events. Studies involving challenging sporting events (prolonged sustained or intermittent high-intensity events, hot and humid environments) are needed. Increases in subjective sensations of fatigue may be the result of loss of sleep or disruption of normal sleep patterns. Modifications to the competition timetable may minimise or even eliminate any effect on performance in sport, but there may be negative effects on performance in some events.",

      "abstract": "Stimulants have been used throughout human history for a variety of reasons. High levels of stress and the demanding nature of medical school make their usage among medical students particularly common. The most prevalent stimulant used by students is coffee, followed by tea and other forms of caffeine like sugary energy drinks. In addition, amphetamine-based medications for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been increasing in popularity, which many students take illicitly. Students report taking various forms of stimulants to promote cognitive enhancement, prolong wakefulness and retain focus for long periods of time. Moderate doses of caffeine and amphetamines would lead to enhanced alertness and concentration. However, large increases in dosage or frequency would lead to an increased risk of toxicity and adverse effects. The positive outcomes from stimulant consumption are often overshadowed by the negative side effects and incorrect dosage. Thus, it appears that usage of stimulants should be limited, in favor of a more sustainable approach to cognitive enhancement.",

Most of them had made only small changes in their eating habits, but they strongly appreciated the new possibility for flexibility in eating patterns. The most mentioned advantages were: The new therapy was practical and easy to use, gave more freedom, made social life easier and improved blood glucose control. Many, mainly women, experienced less feelings of guilt, and women also placed the social advantages highest on the list of advantages. The youngest persons thought the greatest benefit was increased freedom, and persons in middle age the possibilities for improved metabolic control.

      "title": "Smoking cessation: the psychiatrist's role.",
      "abstract": "Although tobacco use is one of the leading preventable causes of death and the prevalence of smoking in persons with psychiatric disorders is very high, psychiatrists may be missing opportunities to assist patients to stop smoking, perhaps because this health promotion activity is seen to be in the province of the family physician.1 We may be consulted, however, when patients with psychiatric disorders consider smoking cessation or have difficulty in achieving abstinence.\r\n\r\nA patient with bipolar disorder resolved to stop smoking after experiencing several upper respiratory infections. He was a heavy smoker with a high Fagerstrom nicotine dependence score (8).2 His mood was well stabilized by treatment with lithium carbonate, and his only other medication was atorvastatin.\r\n\r\nThe patient decided on a quit date and started to exercise regularly, to avoid smoking while away from the house and to use nicotine gum 4 mg as needed. With this strategy, his consumption went from over 30 cigarettes daily to about 10 daily; he had no problems apart from cravings for cigarettes. A couple of weeks before the quit date and wishing to further reduce his intake of cigarettes, he saw his family physician, who prescribed varenicline according to the usual schedule (0.5 mg/d initially, increasing to 2 mg/d over 1 week). After starting the varenicline, the patient developed several significant symptoms, many attributable to acute nicotine withdrawal: sadness, difficulty thinking and executing actions, poor energy, and somatic sensations including “kinks in (his) body” and burning eyes. He felt as though he had taken a pill with residual effects that included his head not being clear and an “unnatural feeling.” Cigarettes failed to relieve these symptoms, and the usual feeling of satisfaction from smoking was lacking.\r\n\r\nHe was seen in the clinic after 10 days of treatment with varenicline. It was decided that he would discontinue this medication and attempt to quit as originally planned. His mood and ability to function returned to normal about 4 days after stopping the varenicline, by which time all the symptoms mentioned above had resolved. The patient was subsequently able to stop smoking completely (at the time of writing for 3 weeks) with the aid of the nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).\r\n\r\nVarenicline is a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is the main site of action of nicotine. Like NRT and bupropion, the use of varenicline increases the rate of complete smoking cessation by a factor of about 2 to 3. These pharmacologic aids are best employed in conjunction with various non pharmacologic approaches, including counselling and strategies such as making the home smoke-free and exercising regularly. Bupropion is relatively contraindicated in patients with bipolar disorder, given that it can cause mood cycling. Varenicline appears to be quite safe for use in patients with psychiatric illnesses, but there have been reports of exacerbation of schizophrenia and induction of hypomania, or even mania, following treatment with this drug.3–5\r\n\r\nSmoking cessation is a risk factor for the development of depression, but the timing of this patient's symptoms suggests a withdrawal syndrome resulting from an acute reduction in stimulation of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors after the introduction of varenicline. Occupancy of the nicotinic receptors by this high-affinity drug also accounts for the failure of smoking to relieve the symptoms or produce a positive effect.\r\n\r\nNRT, bupropion and varenicline can be used in combination, and other drugs can also be employed as aids to smoking cessation. A review of these treatments and other aspects of this important field can be found in an excellent article published in the November 2007 issue of the CMAJ6 (cited in bibliography for the online version of this column appearing on the JPN website). NRT in its various forms (patch, gum, etc.) should, in my opinion, be considered the initial drug of choice for smoking cessation, with the other drugs being reserved for cases in which NRT is not tolerated or is ineffective, particularly in patients with psychiatric comorbidity.\r\n\r\nAssisting patients to stop smoking can be highly rewarding, and the more informed we are about developments in this important field, the more effective we will be in helping our patients.\r\n\r\nNicholas J.

      "abstract": "A questao do consumo de drogas licitas ou ilicitas tem mobilizado varios segmentos de nossa sociedade. Contudo, muito se discute sobre elas e pouco sobre o ser humano que as consome por varios motivos. Encontramos em um contingente de pessoas socialmente excluidas, ou nao, uma necessidade de satisfacao imediata de seus desejos, uma menor tolerância a frustracao, uma impulsividade e uma baixa auto-estima, que podem mobilizar condutas aditivas. O tempo para a percepcao da necessidade de tratamento faz com que o dependente quimico procure o servico de saude ja em condicoes clinicas precarias e com diversas perdas socio-economicas. A ambivalencia do paciente e a essencia do problema enfrentado pelos profissionais que trabalham com dependentes quimicos. Inicialmente, o paciente se propoe a experimentar estar abstinente, e presente o valor e a crenca na eficacia, porem, muitos deles desistem durante o percurso do tratamento. Este trabalho se propoe a estudar os valores eticos de um paciente em tratamento do alcoolismo utilizando a metodologia qualitativa. Atraves de dados empiricos coletados por meio de entrevista e leitura de prontuario, buscamos identificar os valores dos pacientes, fundamentados nas reflexoes teoricas de Sanchez-Vazquez. Realizamos a coleta de dados no Nucleo de Atencao a Dependencia Quimica (NADeQ), localizado no Servico de Saude Dr. Cândido Ferreira. O NADeQ e um servico que atende exclusivamente a rede publica de Campinas, sendo vinculado ao Sistema Unico de Saude e conta com uma equipe multidisciplinar. Solicitamos aos profissionais do NADeQ que selecionassem um usuario do sexo masculino para realizar este estudo, que estivesse em tratamento ambulatorial regular no servico, com mais de uma internacao no mesmo, e considerado como um paciente dificil.O estudo contempla as seguintes etapas: fase exploratoria; delimitacao do estudo; confrontacao dos achados com textos de estudiosos no assunto. Na apresentacao e discussao dos resultados, utilizamos recortes dos dados coletados; atraves do discurso do sujeito da pesquisa, identificamos os valores relacionados ao beber que, apesar de obter diversas conquistas (como, por exemplo, moradia, renda mensal, beneficios, comunicacao com a familia, cuidado com a saude e qualidade de vida), arrisca-se a perder tudo pelo prazer de estar alcoolizado. Para o paciente, os valores e significados sao diferentes, pois ele, aparentemente, aceita as orientacoes da recuperacao somente quando esta no limite de sobrevivencia; entretanto, ao alcancar algum bem-estar, ele abre mao de todos os valores que representam equilibrio social e retorna a sua cronica autodestruicao \nAbstract",

      "title": "[Why stopping smoking is difficult in patients suffering from schizophrenia? How better to take care of them?]",
      "abstract": "Smoking is much higher among patients suffering from schizophrenia compared to the general population. These patients inhale the smoke more deeply and extract a significant amount of nicotine from the cigarette. They are highly addicted to tobacco and their attempts to stop smoking are more frequently marked by failures. The continuation of consumption exposes them particularly to the risk of diseases and mortality related to smoking. Various hypotheses are advanced to explain the association between schizophrenia and tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke and/or nicotine appear to compensate for certain cognitive deficits due to the disease or to correct adverse events of anti-psychotics. Furthermore, genetic factors, personality traits and socio-cultural factors appear to be jointly implicated in mental illness and smoking. Smoking cessation, which does not aggravate schizophrenia, combines psycho-social approaches and medication treatments; it can be helped by the use of the electronic cigarette and the practice of physical exercise. Professionals must ensure long-term personalized follow-up.La consommation de tabac est beaucoup plus élevée parmi les patients souffrant de schizophrénie comparativement à la population générale. Ces patients inhalent plus profondément la fumée et extraient une importante quantité de nicotine de la cigarette. Ils présentent une forte dépendance tabagique et leurs tentatives d’arrêt du tabac sont plus fréquemment marquées par des échecs. La poursuite de la consommation les expose particulièrement au risque de maladies et de mortalité en lien avec le tabagisme. Diverses hypothèses sont avancées pour expliquer l’association entre la schizophrénie et le tabagisme : le tabagisme et/ou la nicotine paraissent compenser certains déficits cognitifs dus à la maladie ou corriger des événements indésirables des anti-psychotiques. De plus, des facteurs génétiques, des traits de personnalité et des facteurs sociaux culturels paraissent conjointement impliqués dans la maladie mentale et l’usage du tabac. Le sevrage tabagique qui n’aggrave pas la maladie associe les prises en charge psycho-sociales et les médicaments d’aide à l’arrêt; il peut être aidé par l’usage de la cigarette électronique et la pratique de l’exercice physique. Les professionnels doivent assurer un suivi personnalisé de longue durée.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The progress achieved in the reform era is quite promising, but on the other hand there are still worrying issues, especially regarding the behavior of some of our young generation who are trapped in drug abuse both consuming and distributing it. Narcotics abuse is a national and international problem, because it has a negative impact on the lives of people, nations and countries and their addicts, who are mostly students. Victims of narcotics abuse in Indonesia are increasing and are not limited to groups of people who are able, given the high price of narcotics, but also has penetrated the constraints of low economic society. This can happen because narcotics commodities have many types, from the most expensive ones that can only be bought by the elite or celebrities, to the cheapest ones that are consumed by low economic groups. Misuse and dangers of narcotics Narcotics among adolescents is undeniable that there are still many in the environment around us. The impact of narcotics on health and the future is indeed not insignificant. Many will be sacrificed because of narcotics abuse. Based on the background description of the problem above, the problems in this paper are: (1) What is the Countermeasure of Narcotics Circulation in East Kutai Students? (2) What is the legal process for narcotics dealers in East Kutai Students? The conclusions of this paper (1) The handling of narcotics illicit trafficking needs to be done comprehensively and multidimensionally. Trying to dispel the view that the problem of narcotics abuse and illicit trafficking is not just a matter of the government, but is a problem that must be tackled together. Prevention and eradication of narcotics abuse and illicit trafficking is carried out by building community-based prevention efforts, including through school and non-school education. electronic and print mass media, including advances in internet technology and communication tools, which need to be utilized to the maximum extent possible in providing information to the public at large, Criminal Provisions in Law Number 35 Year 2009, concerning Narcotics are regulated in Articles 110 through Article 148, as with most Criminal Acts outside the Criminal Code the formulation of Criminal provisions in several respects is different from the criminal formulation in the Criminal Code. (2) The implementation of the child protection law and attention to the legal process against problematic children by referring to law number 11 of 2012 as a legal umbrella that must be carried out both directors and Restorative Justice efforts, This is humane and takes into account the rights of children by involving various related parties to reach agreement and settlement while still paying attention to certain criteria. Strictly speaking, law enforcement officials must continue to refer to Article 16 paragraph (3) of Law No. 23 of 2002 which is amended by Law No. 35 of 2016 that protects children, namely that the arrest, detention or criminal offenses of children are only carried out if they are in accordance with applicable law and can only be done as a last resort.

Dietary restrictions can be as restrictive as no food or liquids allowed by mouth, which may increase in a stepwise fashion until reaching regular nutrition. One step in that progression is a full liquid diet. A patient prescribed a full liquid diet follows a specific diet type requiring all liquids and semi-liquids but no forms of solid intake. Unlike a clear liquid diet, which includes only liquids and semi-liquids that are non-opaque, a full liquid diet is more inclusive, as it allows all types of liquids.",

Not only have aluminum compounds been widely used for water treatment, food preservation, and pharmaceuticals, but the metal is also increasingly important in numerous industrial applications. The long-accepted commercial use of aluminum and its compounds has led to considerable resistance to investigating the possible role of aluminum in human disease. Indeed, the complex chemistry of aluminum, the slow accumulation in nervous tissues, and the delayed toxic expression of this element have compounded the difficulty in assigning a precise role in human disease. However, increasing evidence, accumulated in the last five years, has raised important public health concerns regarding excess aluminum exposure in some segments of the population.",

These acute lesions caused by large intravenous doses suggest the possibility that the introduction of the amino-acid into the body in small doses with the food over a long period of time might also produce injury. This investigation was devised to obtain an answer to this question. Cystine was selected as the amino-acid to be studied in this regard for several reasons: 1.

      "abstract": "Summary Caffeine is the most popular drug in the world. After consumption, it is rapidly distributed throughout the body where it acts by blocking the action of endogenous adenosine at adenosine A 1 and A 2a receptors, resulting in a variety of physiological effects. Although it is valued as a useful psychostimulant, recent evidence suggests that actually little or no acute benefit is gained from regular caffeine consumption. This is because withdrawal of caffeine ( e.g. overnight) lowers alertness and mood and degrades performance, and while consumption of some more caffeine reverses these effects, it does not boost functioning to above ‘normal’ levels. It also tends to increase anxiety, particularly in susceptible individuals. In contrast, caffeine consumption may separately lower the risk of cognitive decline in older age, perhaps owing to effects involving neuroprotective functions of the adenosine system. Currently, however, not enough is known to do a full risk assessment on these or other potential health effects of dietary caffeine.",

Sin embargo, desafortunadamente no todos los fumadores quieren dejar de fumar. Existen estrategias que pueden ser útiles en aquellos sujetos que no desean dejar de fumar de forma brusca, o que simplemente no desean dejar de fumar, pero si les gustaría reducir el consumo de tabaco. El método de “reducción hasta dejarlo” (RDH) es una estrategia que puede ser útil en fumadores no preparados para dejar de fumar. La terapia sustitutiva con nicotina (TSN) ha demostrado ser efectiva y segura tanto en el método de reducción del consumo de tabaco como en la cesación tabáquica completa. Esta estrategia aumenta tanto la autoeficacia como la motivación en este grupo y disminuye la dependencia física a la nicotina, lo que aumentaría la probabilidad de abandono definitivo a largo plazo.",

Merokok adalah kebiasaan. Kebiasaan inilah yang menjadi sebuah tradisi yang sulit dilepaskan atau ditinggalkan. Perubahan emosi bagi distributor adalah perubahan emosi yang disebabkan oleh kebiasaan merokok yang berdampak pada gejala-gejala fisiologis sehingga terjadi baik perubahan emosi positif maupun perubahan emosi negatif. Merokok pada orang dewasa dapat digunakan menjadi dua, berdasarkan kuantitas merokok yang dikonsumsi. Kelompok pertama adalah perokok moderat, yaitu perokok yang menghabiskan kurang dari sebelas batang perhari. Kelompok kedua adalah perokok berat, yaitu perokok yang menghabiskan lebih dari sebelas batang perhari. Jika perokok termasuk ke dalam kelompok moderat, bukan berarti bebas dari segala hal buruk yang bakal mengganggu kesehatan dan kepribadian seseorang, tetapi harap diingat dampak kumulatifnya. Kandungan racun dari asap rokok yang dihisap bagi perokok hari demi hari akan tertimbun di dalam tubuh, sedangkan tubuh sama sekali tidak dapat menghilangkan pengaruh nikotin dalam jumlah sekecil apapun. Akibatnya merokok pada orang dewasa sangat berpengaruh pada perubahan emosi negatif, seperti cepat marah, hampa atau geram, cemas atau gelisah dan stres. \r\nAnalisis penulis bahwa ada beberapa zat-zat yang terkandung dalam rokok sangat erat kaitannya dengan perubahan emosi negatif maupun emosi positif, Emosi yang ditimbulkan pada reaksi emosi positif seperti kenikmatan, kegembiraan dan kesenangan bagi ketiga distributor PT.

      "abstract": "On many data sheets the section headed ‘Uses’, contains the word ‘indication’ or the phrase ‘. . . is indicated in. . . ’. This term is ambiguous. When doctors speak of an indication, they usually mean that the drug referred to should be used for that purpose for medical reasons. When manufacturers list indications they nearly always mean that the drug can be used for that purpose, and imply that they hope it will be so used - even though other drugs may be more suitable for some of the purposes listed. As a result the manufacturer’s indications for a product tend to be far wider than the prescriber’s. To avoid this confusion over interpretation we suggest that the word ‘indication’ and phrases such as ‘is indicated’ should not be used in data sheets. Forms such as ‘ . . . is effective in . . . ’ or ‘ . . . can be used to treat . . . ’ should be used instead.",

      "abstract": "Until the last quarter of a century, alcoholism was almost universally regarded as a mere moral perversion, a bad habit entered into and continued because of moral degeneracy. Numerous efforts were made to reclaim and reform the drunkard. Almost all of these consisted in an appeal to the moral and emotional nature of drinking men and many were thus influenced to abandon the use of alcohol, but a large majority were unreached by these efforts. In more recent years, the wretched condition of these men has appealed strongly to scientific men who were students of human nature as well as of abstract science, and the causes or influences which lead such men to enter on and continue the use of alcoholic beverages has been studied from every view-point. These studies have fully established the fact that only in a very small percentage of cases is alcoholism a mere moral perversion,",

      "abstract": "Een aantal gezondheidsorganisaties heeft de overheid voorgesteld om een verbod in te stellen van kortingsacties op suikerhoudende dranken. Door deze maatregel zou de verkoop van suikerhoudende dranken afnemen. Nederlanders krijgen teveel suiker binnen, vooral via suikerhoudende dranken. De overheid heeft het RIVM de opdracht gegeven om literatuuronderzoek te doen naar het effect van een verbod op verkoopkortingen, marketing en reclame op de verkoop van suikerhoudende dranken en producten. De effectiviteit van een verbod op prijsaanbiedingen en/of een verbod op marketing en reclame in de supermarkt op de verkoop van suikerhoudende dranken zijn nog niet direct onderzocht. Wel zijn er indirecte aanwijzingen dat deze maatregelen kunnen bijdragen aan het verlagen van de aankoop van suikerhoudende dranken. Prijsaanbiedingen komen vooral voor op ongezonde producten en verhogen, in ieder geval op korte termijn, de verkoop. Het verbieden van reclame-uitingen voor ongezonde voedingsmiddelen op televisie, radio of internet gericht op jonge kinderen lijkt effectief om de verkoop hiervan te verlagen. In hoeverre een verbod op prijsaanbiedingen en/of een marketing- en reclameverbod, specifiek in de supermarkt, op langere termijn een direct effect heeft op de consumptie van suikerhoudende dranken, moet nog onderzocht worden. Het RIVM heeft de wetenschappelijk literatuur naar de effecten van (een verbod op) prijsaanbiedingen en reclame en marketing op de verkoop en consumptie van suikerhoudende dranken en voedingsmiddelen verkend. De resultaten hiervan staan beschreven in dit briefrapport.",

This is quite different from the dosages involved when anorexiants are used properly as an adjunct in the total treatment of obesity. They constitute an initial “crutch” to help strongly motivated stable patients to change their eating habits. Anorexiants should never be used on a long‐term basis. As the total program is difficult for both patient and physician, any temporary therapy of such value to the obese patient should not be prohibited if given under the supervision of an experienced physician who knows the indications for withdrawal. Under these circumstances, the hazards are minimal.",

Awareness of the damage caused by consuming this substance is clear in some areas, while in others it may be ignored, underestimated or poorly dimensioned. The information systems that do exist almost certainly underestimate the number of deaths connected with cocaine. Apart from the potential the drug has to cause direct damage to different organs of the body, its consumption can lead to serious problems arising from other circumstances that are not always connected with this drug, including murders, traffic accidents and accidents at work, infectious diseases related to high-risk behaviour, and suicides. Cocaine is increasingly present in cases of violence such as fights or aggression, in many cases accompanied by the use of knives and firearms. Serious behavioural disorders are being seen more and more frequently in the healthcare services, and in clinics we are witnessing a worrying increase on a day-to-day basis of conflictive episodes associated with the use of cocaine amongst our patients. This damage does not only affect a marginal population, but instead all levels of society, and often goes unnoticed or unreported. Coordination between different institutions and healthcare areas is essential in order to obtain this information, and in this way to provide a more precise picture of the consequences of Cocaine consumption, as today we are still far from having quantified its true dimension.",

Although, narcotics' abuse was not so important during the time of Honorable Prophet Mohammed and innocent Imams (S), and we don't have any specific verse or narration in this regard, since Islam is a universal and eternal religion, and have completely provided all the needs of the society at all ages, and has met all the humankinds' wishes, so it has paid attention to this subject and has warned people from different sides about not using narcotics. Because of many adverse effects of drugs and smoke, and referring to some verses of Quran and some hadith, which have forbidden the malevolence we can conclude that muslims should avoid of smoking and drug abuse.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUÇÃO: O uso do tabaco está presente na história da sociedade desde o século XV, e se tornou muito utilizado e vicioso entre seus consumidores. Esse uso exagerado e precoce é um dos principais causadores de enfermidades, dentre elas, vários tipos de câncer (pulmão, pulmonar, bronquite crônica, asma e infecções respiratórias). OBJETIVO: Analisar a prática e o uso do tabaco na sociedade de modo geral. METODOLOGIA: Nesta análise foi aplicado uma busca bibliográfica utilizando como material de estudos, artigos científicos online listados como: Smoking Cessation Attempts and Common Strategies Employed (PubMed), Culture, acculturation and smoking use in Hmong, Khmer, Laotians, and Vietnamese communities in Minnesota (PubMed) e Reflections on passive smoking and COVID-19(PubMed). RESULTADOS: A partir dos dados analisados durante a pesquisa, foi possível observar que o uso do tabaco aumenta o risco e a chance de diversas condições sistêmicas negativas ao organismo, incluindo o câncer, doenças cardiovasculares e pulmonares, sendo também um grande danificador da saúde bucal aumentando a incidência e gravidade de câncer bucal e doenças periodontais no indivíduo tabagista, além de que o tabagismo é reconhecido globalmente como a principal causa mundial de morte evitável, sendo responsável por cerca de 100 milhões de pessoas. Mesmo havendo projetos para se combater e cessar o ato tabagista, como o MPOWER, a quantidade de pessoas que seguem esse protocolo ainda são poucas, não havendo grandes efeitos na redução do tabagista. CONCLUSÃO: Portanto, foi concluído que a prática do tabagismo na sociedade se deve de fatores sociais, culturais e neurofisiológicos decorrentes do uso frequentemente dessa substância que se torna viciosa para os consumidores e prejudicial à saúde.",

      "title": "Coca Chewing and High-Altitude Stress: A Spurious Correlation [and Comments and Reply]",
      "abstract": "Because the main present-day centres of coca chewing are in the high altiplano regions of Peru and Bolivia, it has been widely assumed that the habit evolved primarily as a response to the stresses of life at high altitudes. When archaeological, ethnohistorical, and botanical sources of evidence are considered, a different emphasis emerges. Before the European conquest, coca was chewed everywhere from Nicaragua to Chile and at all altitudes. This pattern goes back to at least 2000 B.C. in coastal Peru and Ecuador and has considerable time-depth elsewhere. Even today, coca taking is linked not primarily with high-altitude life, but with the survival of traditional Indian culture. Apart from its role in indigenous culture, coca is everywhere regarded as a stimulant conferring resistance against hunger, thirst, and fatigue, none of which is specifically a high-altitude problem. Pharmacological data confirm that coca acts as a general stimulant by preventing the removal of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline from its site of action. This action resembles the effect of drugs used in medicine to treat depression and, more distantly, the action of caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee.",

      "title": "Body mass management of lightweight rowers: nutritional strategies and performance implications",
      "abstract": "The majority of lightweight rowers undertake acute weight loss prior to competition. Given the competitive advantage afforded to larger, more muscular rowers over their smaller counterparts, the use of moderate, acute weight loss may be justified, at least among larger, leaner athletes who struggle to achieve the specified body mass requirement and have limited potential for further body mass loss via reductions in body fat. The performance implications of moderate acute weight loss appear to be small on the ergometer and may be even less on water, at least when aggressive recovery strategies are adopted between weigh-in and racing. Furthermore, any performance implications of acute weight loss are not exacerbated when such weight loss is undertaken repeatedly throughout the course of a regatta, and may even be eliminated when aggressive recovery strategies are introduced before and after racing. The combination of adequate sodium, fluid and carbohydrate in line with current guidelines results in the best performances. While the performance implications of modest acute weight loss may still need to be considered in regard to competition outcome, chronic body mass strategies may not be without performance implications. This is especially the case for athletes who have very low levels of body fat and/or athletes who decrease their body mass too quickly. Further studies are needed to address the degree of weight loss that can be tolerated with minimal health and/or performance implications, and the optimal time frame over which this should occur. Possible adaptation to the physiological state that accompanies acute weight loss also warrants investigation.",

      "title": "Adult Picky Eaters With Symptoms Of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder: Comparable Distress And Comorbidity But Different Eating Behaviors Compared To Those With Disordered Eating Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Picky eaters are people who avoid many new and familiar foods because they dislike the taste, smell, texture, or appearance of many foods. When it is severe, picky eating can lead to weight loss or difficulty maintaining a healthy weight, nutritional deficiencies, dependence on supplements to get adequate nutrition or calories, or shame, anxiety, or difficulty engaging in daily life. When severe picky eating leads to these consequences, it can be diagnosed as Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). People who restrict the amount of food they consume (or engage in exercise, purging, or fasting behaviors to get rid of calories after eating) because they are afraid of gaining weight or being fat are diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia when their eating leads to weight loss, nutritional problems, or interferes with life. ARFID is a new diagnosis, and in this paper, we show that 1) adults with ARFID symptoms are just as distressed, and just as likely to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder, as those with anorexia or bulimia, but that 2) adults with ARFID show very different types of eating behavior from adults with symptoms of anorexia or bulimia.",

      "title": "Smoking and Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Evidence is presented for a negative correlation between smoking and Parkinson's disease. The reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease amounts to about half the risk in non-smokers and is demonstrable even in those who have ceased smoking up to 20 years before the onset of the disease. How this protective effect is mediated is unknown and in particular it is uncertain whether or not it is related to nicotine.",

      "title": "Drug Absorption With Food",
      "abstract": "Oral input is the most convenient route for drug administration so the large majority of drug products are oral dosage forms. This dictates consideration of the timing of drug administration with respect to the time of meal ingestion. There are several reasons for taking a drug with a meal or nutrient beverage. It may be expedient for clinical staff in hospitals and assisted living centers to administer a drug at a time when meals are provided for inpatients. Outpatient compliance with the prescribed drug dosage regimen may be aided with administration at regular mealtimes. Some drugs are irritating in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and their administration with food or a nutrient beverage can diminish this effect as compared to administration with water.",
