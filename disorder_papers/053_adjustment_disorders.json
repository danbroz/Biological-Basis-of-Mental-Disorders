Very often, the pain is \"non specific\", meaning related to a mechanical origin. The main factors inducing the pain to become chronic are individual factors, psychological factors or socio-professional factors. The socio-professional factors are often much more influential than the physical factors. The overwhelming element of treatment is physical exercise. Other methods of treatment like cognitive therapy, behavioural therapy and multidisciplinary rehabilitation can also lead to significant improvements.",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "abstract": "During and immediately following a traumatic event, people may manifest a pattern of dissociative and anxiety symptoms and other reactions, referred to as Acute Stress Disorder. A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided. Although it was not officially recognized in the 3rd edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III-R), Acute Stress Disorder is included as a separate diagnosis in the DSM-IV.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) was introduced in the mood disorders section of DSM-5. Its primary symptoms are \"severe, recurrent temper outbursts\" (manifested verbally and/or physically) superimposed on and associated with chronic irritability. DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During and immediately following a traumatic event, people may manifest a pattern of dissociative and anxiety symptoms and other reactions, referred to as Acute Stress Disorder. A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided. Although it was not officially recognized in the 3rd edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM‐III‐R), Acute Stress Disorder is included as a separate diagnosis in the DSM‐IV.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

Sport transitions may be accompanied by changes in identity, interpersonal relationships, schedules, and behavioural changes. Psychosocial outcomes following sport retirement can be broadly differentiated between acute psychological distress, mental health disorders, and healthy adjustment. Acute psychological distress following sport retirement may be best understood in the context of stressful life events. Stressful life events, such as job transitions and family conflict, have been shown to predict the onset of mental health concerns, such as depression. Sport retirement is a significant life event, and negative emotions are a common response to the transition. Adjustment disorder is characterised by the onset of emotional or behavioural symptoms within three months of an identifiable stressor and does not persist past six months after termination of the stressor.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder (BPD) according to DSM-5 is the sudden onset of psychotic behavior that lasts less than 1 month followed by complete remission with possible future relapses. It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "title": "Psychosocial problems observed in older adults after disaster",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural disasters are large‐scale catastrophic events that seriously disrupt the functioning of a community or society. The frequency and severity of disasters are increasing and involve widespread human, material, economic, or environmental impacts that exceed the ability of the society affected by them to cope using its resources. In addition, disasters significantly affect the physical, emotional, and psychological health of individuals and cause numerous deaths, injuries, and economic losses. One of the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of disasters is the elderly. The increase in the elderly population worldwide brings with it the problems specific to this period and the service needs for these problems. The population consists of older adults, who are among the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of natural disasters. During the social traumatisation process triggered by natural disasters, elderly people experience intense feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, futurelessness, and insecurity. Reactions such as unresponsiveness, alienation, inability to focus, and inability to remember are normal during this process. The normality of these feelings and responses in the acute period, which can last up to 3 months, will give way to abnormality unless the necessary physical and psychosocial conditions are provided. When the necessary psychosocial conditions are not provided, elderly individuals who experience a disaster may experience mental problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression, somatisation disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. In this context, providing the necessary psychosocial support for older adults to cope with psychosocial problems after a disaster and facilitating access to this support is very important in terms of adapting to the post‐disaster period.",

The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues. Considering the major anxiety disorders, the somatic symptoms in Panic Disorder tend to appear initially in discrete episodes. The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s). Pain disorder associated with a general medical condition was not considered to be a mental disorder, because the requirement was not met that psychological factors play an important role.",

      "title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder",
      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

The statistics regarding postconcussion syndrome vary considerably with the population studied. Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

Development of effective management strategies is hindered by confusing terminology.Research investigating treatments often use \"agitation\" or \"behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)\" as an outcome measure without differentiating the context in which these behaviors occurred.Actually, a recent review of 85 measures, used for assessing behavioral symptoms of dementia, found that \"no measures identify risk factors for behaviors or enable an evaluation of the context in which behaviors occur\". 1 At the same time, it is recognized that there is a need for identification of context in which behavior occurred for effective management as is described in the DICE approach. 2,3e most important context in which behavior occurs is presence or absence of another person.This context can distinguish two main types of behaviors: agitation and rejection of care. 4Agitation can be defined as \"behaviors that communicate to others [who observe the patient] that the patient is experiencing and unpleasant state of excitement and which remain after interventions to reduce internal or external stimuli have been carried out\". 5i.e., medical conditions, pain, medication side-effects, environmental factors, hunger or thirst, and others.Symptoms of agitation include general restlessness, repetitive mannerisms, pacing, trying to get to a different place, handling inappropriately, hiding things, inappropriate dressing and undressing and repetitive sentences. 6Agitation occurs when the person with dementia does not interact with others, i.e., is solitary.Rejection of care occurs in most cases when a caregiver tries to provide care for a person who does not understand the need for it, or misperceives the action as threatening, and resists caregiver's actions. 7If the caregiver insists to provide care, the person with dementia may defend himself/herself from unwanted attention, may become combative and develop reactive aggression.This reactive aggression can be defined as \"the repertoire of behaviors with which persons with dementia withstand of oppose the efforts of a caregiver\". 8and includes hitting, pushing, scratching, grabbing things or people, kicking and biting, screaming, cursing, temper outbursts, and making strange noises. 9",

Stress can be defined as a negative emotional experience accompanied by predictable biochemical, physiological, and behavioral changes that are directed toward adaptation either by manipulating the situation to alter the stressor or by accommodating its effects. Chronic stress is more complex than most definitions suggest and is clearly not limited to situations in which stressors persist for long periods of time. Responses may habituate before a stressor disappears or may persist long beyond the physical presence of the stressor. This latter case, in which chronic stress and associated biobehavioral changes outlast their original cause, is considered in light of research at Three Mile Island and among Vietnam veterans. The role of intrusive images of the stressor or uncontrollable thoughts about it in maintaining stress is explored.",

      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

This definition has endured through time; however, the classification of the different types of pain is evolving. Original descriptions of pain were based on a temporal evolution, where the distinction between acute and chronic pain was that if it lasted for more than six months it was considered chronic. Another more conservative and innovative view proposed one month as the defining criterion. These early definitions did not account for the mechanisms involved in the development of the pain. The prevailing contemporary view is to classify pain according to the primary pathology involved in the cause of pain, namely: inflammatory (acute) or neuropathic (chronic). The latter can be considered a disease of the nervous system and not merely a symptom of some other condition. Furthermore, poorly treated acute pain can lead to neuropathic chronic pain. The current temporal cutoff value for chronic pain is three months.",

      "abstract": "Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), results from a force to the head and can cause acute physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms. The majority of concussion symptoms will resolve within a month, but upward of a third of patients will have persistent, chronic symptoms. When these symptoms become chronic and persist beyond 1–3 months, this is termed post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Psychological changes associated with PCS may in part be due to a traumatic event and the injury itself and therefore post-traumatic stress reactions may contribute. In addition, alterations to daily life and alteration of lifestyle as a result of the injury can cause feelings of disconnection which in turn can feed anxiety and depression symptoms. A preinjury diagnosis or history of psychiatric or mood disorder, migraine, or family history of psychiatric illness is one the greatest risk factors for the development of PCS. It is recommended that evaluation of concussion and those with PCS take a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation by psychology, psychiatry, and/or neuropsychology. While most concussions do not require treatment, those with PCS will not likely see the resolution of their physical and psychological symptoms without intervention. Treatment is limited, but cognitive behavioral treatment has shown promise in the management of PCS symptoms. It is important to recognize the role psychology plays in the development and persistence of PCS and to recognize and seek collaborative care when treating these patients.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

The interviewer should also ask the parent whether these outbursts are unexpected or unusual, given their child's age. To meet the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must occur on average three or more times per week, and must be constant for 12 months or more, without a period of 3 months of normal mood. Moreover, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must have started before age 10, but not before age 6.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder in Children",
      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

      "title": "Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief",
      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining.

Un individuo che viene sottoposto per un breve periodo di tempo ad eventi stressanti, presentera quello che viene definito stress acuto, mentre se la durata dell’evento stressante permane per un lungo periodo di tempo, egli sara soggetto a stress cronico. Oltre alla distinzione dalla durata del tempo che un individuo e sottoposto a stress, si possono individuare due altre tipologie di stress basate sulla natura degli eventi stressanti. Si puo parlare di eustress quando gli stressor comportano conseguenze positive e dei veri e propri benefici che contribuiscono ad apportare una maggior vitalita dell’organismo. Anteposto all’eustress e il distress, caratterizzato da stressor negativi, nocivi per l’organismo. Quando il distress si presenta in maniera cronica, puo essere associato a numerosi disturbi e disfunzioni dell’organismo. Quando lo stress si presenta in maniera eccessiva e per un lungo periodo di tempo e necessario intervenire cosi da evitare delle conseguenze psicofisiche adottando delle strategie di coping, dei veri e propri meccanismi di difesa dallo stress cronico. Sono molteplici le ricerche effettuate per indagare quali strategie di coping sono piu ideali per prevenire o allentare lo stress e i correlati psicofisici che esso comporta.\r\n\r\nObiettivi\r\nGli obiettivi di questo lavoro di ricerca, oltre ad un approfondimento generale sul tema dello stress, ai suoi fattori scatenanti e ai rischi patologie correlate che esso include, e quello di individuare e valutare le strategie di coping piu efficaci che sono state e che vengono tutt’ora adottate da infermieri esperti clinici in salute mentale per allentare ed eliminare i sintomi dovuti allo stress assorbito sul proprio posto di lavoro. Lo sviluppo di tale lavoro si basa sull’analisi di sette articoli scientifici reperiti da diverse banche dati infermieristiche. Oltre a portare alla luce le differenti strategie di coping contro il distress cronico, sara mio compito scoprire e far emergere quali figure professionali possono contribuire e aiutare maggiormente gli individui che necessitano di queste strategie, in particolar modo cerchero di svelare il ruolo dell’infermiere in tale processo.\r\n\r\nMetodologia\r\nPer lo sviluppo di questo lavoro di tesi e stata utilizzata una metodologia di revisione della letteratura. Sono stati presi in considerazione sette articoli scientifici, accomunati da un indicatore temporale che va dal 2005 ad oggi. La stesura del lavoro e organizzata in quattro parti, nella prima parte vi e un’introduzione al lavoro con la motivazione della scelta. La seconda parte contiene il quadro teorico che supporta l’elaborazione della revisione. La terza parte presenta la revisione della letteratura, con i rispettivi risultate e la discussione. La quarta parte e composta dalle conclusioni del lavoro.\r\n\r\nRisultati\r\nDall’analisi dei sette articoli scientifici sono emerse nove efficaci strategie di coping, adottate da infermieri esperti clinici in salute mentale e psichiatria.

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

These symptoms are experience for over 1 month, but in some cases, symptom onset may be delayed. Due to the severity of the comorbid depression and/or anxiety disorders, sleep disturbance and anger, many patients are unable to focus on psychological treatment without the assistance of pharmacotherapy. Factors that contribute to recovery include the presence of positive social and community supports and an empathetic therapeutic relationship. Factors such as substance abuse and antisocial personality can have a negative effect on the response to treatment. (author abstract)",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of major depressive episode in the elderly leads to impairment on several aspects of daily life, including life quality, morbid - mortality and increases rates of suicide risks. Stress and life events are frequent triggers of depressive episode in elderly. The present review aimed to explore the aspects related to the onset of depression in old age, focusing on psychosocial and stress. In order to achieve that, we systematically reviewed papers published in the Medline database from 2003-2013. From this study, we verify that depression in the elderly is a complex disorder, more often associated to psychosocial aspects and chronic stress than to genetic and biomarkers. Loneliness, daily and chronic stress, lack of social support, mourning and economical aspects such as retirement and job loss are major risk factors for depression. Generally, negative life events were noticed to cause poorer mental health in advanced age and cumulative stressful events or traumas untreated too. Furthermore, cognitive functions may be affected negatively by lifelong chronic stressors. These events can cause quite a few different impacts in distinct cultures and lifestyles. The consequences also depend on the duration, or on the life period that these episodes occur. The treatment of depression in the elderly should target both medication and psychotherapy in order to account for psychological aspects, especially treatments based on life review. These perspectives are important due to the possibility of development of specific target strategies in order to prevent those risk factors and improve quality of life in elderly. Many points were contradictorily related, overdue the papers had noticed different conclusions about the same studied points. Face of this, we grouped relevant articles with the same results. Notwithstanding, there were points that require more studies, considering the relevance of the theme.",

      "title": "Stressing out, or outing stress?",
      "abstract": "Stress is an unavoidable component of our working life. How we deal with it may have profound consequences for our job satisfaction, our health and the standard of care we are able to give our patients [1]. Any stressful event will elicit a characteristic physiological response consisting of autonomic stimulation and heightened arousal, which will then persist to some degree for the duration of the stressful stimulus. During an acutely stressful event, such as an intraoperative critical incident, this 'fight or flight' reaction may directly contribute to the resolution of the stressful event. On the other hand, because chronic occupational stresses such as poor working conditions or extended hours are seldom amenable to rapid resolution, the fight or flight reaction in these circumstances may be both inappropriate and ineffective. Our ability to tolerate stress is the result of a complicated interaction of inconstant factors. These include our own personality and coping skills, our current levels of fatigue, distraction or frustration, our experience of previous stressors, the strength of our social or occupational support and, not least, the nature of the stressor itself. However, a fundamental component is our individual 'locus of control' [2]. This term describes our belief in our ability to influence events around us, individuals who believe they have this ability having an 'internal' locus, in contrast to those with an 'external' locus who place more emphasis on the role of chance. Individuals with an internal locus of control tend to report less occupational stress than those without it [3]. Recent studies of occupational stress in nurses have demonstrated the complex relation between the perception of stress and the character of the individual. In a study comparing occupational stress between intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and non-ICU nurses, the ICU nurses found that their ICU nursing activities were less stressful than non-ICU nurses found their non-ICU nursing tasks to be [4]. The authors concluded that ICU nurses had maximized their job satisfaction, and minimized their occupational stress, by selecting a speciality that offered them the high degree of personal autonomy and job complexity which they required for personal fulfilment. In a separate study, when ICU nurses were asked to specify the most stressful aspect of being an ICU patient they selected items relating to loss of personal control significantly more frequently than ICU patients did when given the same questionnaire [5]. The association of a preference for working in a stressful environment, a strong need for personal autonomy and an internal locus of control has been described as 'Type A' behaviour [6]. This rather loose term also includes characteristics such as self-confidence and a strong work commitment, a preference to work alone when under pressure and an urgent sense of time pressure. Type A behaviour is observed more frequently in doctors than in other health professionals, and is associated with a high level of job satisfaction, a low perception of occupational stress and a low requirement for sick leave [2]. Although the prevalence of Type A behaviour in different medical specialities has not been studied, it is likely that doctors who have chosen a speciality in which they usually work alone, and in an environment over which they can exert a high degree of personal control, might be expected to display marked Type A behaviour patterns. Many anaesthetists and intensivists will recognize this as a description of their own working practice. If Type A behaviour offers a degree of protection against the consequences of choosing a profession with a high exposure to occupational stress [3], and if doctors in general, and anaesthetists in particular, display a high prevalence of this behaviour, is there any need to be concerned about our exposure to stress in the workplace? The obverse to the high-achieving behaviour of the Type A individual is their tendency to suppress symptoms of fatigue, and sacrifice their own and their family's social needs, to their pursuit of a successful career [6]. This is exemplified by the results of a survey of occupational stress in health professionals, which demonstrated that doctors made less use of coping strategies such as social support, and were less able to separate home and work, than almost any other group [2]. It has even been suggested that health workers have a particular susceptibility to occupational stress because of the emotional stresses to which they are exposed [7], particularly if they have not been trained to deal with these aspects of their work [8]. Occupational stress is usually beyond the individual's control, and is therefore exactly the form of stress with which competitive, achievement-orientated Type A individuals are least able to deal [3]. In the face of such stressors, individuals may adopt coping strategies such as denial or rationalization which, whilst providing apparent short-term relief, actually perpetuate the individual's exposure to the stressor. Furthermore, although decreasing the individual's emotional involvement in a stressful situation may be helpful in the short-term, in the face of continued exposure these coping mechanisms can lead to a growing sense of detachment and cynicism, impairing the health professional's ability to emphathize with their patient, and resulting in a progressive reduction in job satisfaction. If their home and work environment are already poorly separated, the emotional detachment is likely to extend into the individual's home life, and slowly erode the support it previously offered [9]. In the long term, this will increase the doctor's vulnerability to prolonged stress and lead to social isolation, professional over-involvement, emotional exhaustion and 'burn out' [2]. Finally, the sustained fight or flight response elicited by continued exposure to the stressor may itself present a significant threat to the doctor's own health, through an increased risk of cardiovascular or infectious disease, as well as depression, anxiety and excessive alcohol consumption [10-12]. Another, more recent, factor adds a potent source of stress to this fragile structure. The protective effect of an internal locus of control on the perception of occupational stress is diminished if the individual feels they have lost control of the stressor. The recent organizational changes to the delivery of health care in many developed countries, with the consequent reduction in doctors' autonomy, poses exactly this risk. A recent study has confirmed an increase in the level of occupational stress, and a fall in morale, amongst doctors as a consequence of these changes [13]. These changes illustrate the challenge that is facing the profession. As doctors, we have chosen to work in a highly competitive, achievement-orientated environment. As anaesthetists and intensivists, we have selected a speciality in which our high degree of personal autonomy, and our control over our environment, contribute to our job satisfaction. Yet, as individuals, we are faced with a growing burden of occupational stressors that fall outside our control, and with which we are poorly equipped to deal. Since we are unlikely to be able to reduce our exposure to these stresses significantly, we should take steps to improve our ability to deal with them. The first of these steps is to acknowledge our exposure to stresses beyond our control. The observations on doctors' behaviour through the centuries suggest that we are not good at conceding our own vulnerability and that, as care givers, we make poor recipients. This should not be a point of pride. Second, we need to accept that not only are we probably not as good at dealing with these stresses as we might like to believe, but also that they may compromise both our health and the health and happiness of our families. Finally, we have to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills they will need to meet the roles they will encounter in the course of their careers. This does not simply mean training doctors to deal with identifiable stresses such as starting a new job [8], comforting the bereaved [14] or managing the department [15], although this is important. We also need to develop a working environment in which we have the skills to support our juniors and the expectation that our colleagues will support us. Clearly this cannot be imposed by management directive. Rather it is the responsibility of us all to learn how to provide support to our colleagues, and to encourage them to support us. Stress, like mortality, involves us all, and denial is no cure. C. E. Granger Blackpool M. P. Shelly Manchester",

      "abstract": "Described over a century ago, schizophrenia still presents personal, clinical and scientific challenges, and is increasingly considered a concept rather than a single disorder. It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "title": "Uncomplicated depression is normal sadness, not depressive disorder: further evidence from the NESARC",
      "abstract": "We write to update the results of our recent paper 1 suggesting that uncomplicated depressive episodes are not in fact disorders and should be excluded from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We also address some concerns expressed about our claims. The concept of \"uncomplicated depression\" is essentially a generalization to all stressors of the \"bereavement exclusion\" that appeared in DSM-IV (and was eliminated in DSM-5). Uncomplicated depression is defined as a response to a stressor that satisfies current DSM-5 five-symptoms-for-two-weeks criteria for MDD but is better explainable as a normal distress response, as evidenced by the fact that it lasts no longer than six months and does not include any of the following pathosuggestive symptoms: marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and psychomotor retardation. Uncomplicated episodes thus contain only depressive symptoms common in general distress reactions (e.g., sadness, moderate withdrawal or role impairment, decreased interest in usual activities, insomnia, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue). In our recent paper 1, using longitudinal data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study 2, we found that in those with lifetime uncomplicated MDD at baseline, the one-year recurrence rate (3.4%) was not significantly different from the background MDD incidence rate in those who never previously had MDD (1.7%), but both were dramatically lower than recurrence rates in other (\"complicated\") MDD (14.6%). Thus, in terms of recurrence risk, uncomplicated MDD is different from other MDD but indistinguishable from no-MDD-history. We concluded that \"consideration should be given to eliminating uncomplicated episodes as a class from MDD diagnosis\". However, that study had several limitations. We 3 therefore replicated and broadened the analysis using an entirely different, more recently collected longitudinal community data set – the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 4) – that allowed a more clinically meaningful 3-year follow-up window and use of an expanded set of three clinically important validators (depression recurrence, suicide attempt, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), as well as other advantages in measuring impairment and clinical significance. Due to data-set limitations, only single-episode uncomplicated cases could be evaluated in this study. The results were that people with single-episode uncomplicated major depression had rates during follow-up of MDD recurrence (6.9%), GAD (4.3%), and suicide attempt (0.1%) that were not significantly different from background rates for those who never had MDD (6.1%, 2.7%, and 0.3%, respectively), but were dramatically and significantly lower than rates for both single-episode complicated cases (19.5%, 7.8%, and 0.8%, respectively) and multiple-episode cases (27.1%, 11.2%, and 1.7%, respectively) 3. The results were not explainable by group differences in severity or treatment rates. Given the replication's success, we concluded that uncomplicated MDD is a benign condition that is typologically distinct from the rest of MDD, thus supporting our earlier thesis that uncomplicated MDD is in fact a form of normal sadness. However, in a commentary on the replication, Maj 5 expressed some concerns about the evidence provided by our study. These previously unaddressed concerns are now considered. In MDD, the quality of remission, and especially the number of residual depressive symptoms, is important both because subthreshold depression is harmful in itself and such symptoms predict recurrence and may indicate a latent pathology. Yet, Maj notes, our studies did not report the residual symptom levels among those not experiencing MDD during the follow-up. To address this concern, we analyzed the average number of MDD symptom groups experienced during follow-up by individuals in each of our baseline MDD groups who did not have recurrences during the follow-up period. In each of the four baseline wave 1 lifetime MDD history groups, the mean number of residual symptom groups experienced by those who had no wave 2 recurrences during the 3-year follow-up period was: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35-0.39) for the no lifetime MDD history group (N=25,514); 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=379); 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=1,756); and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.10) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=1,876). Thus, there is not a significant difference in the number of symptoms during follow-up between the no-MDD-history group and the uncomplicated single episode MDD group. There is no \"residual symptom\" problem indicating implicit pathology or risk of recurrence among the uncomplicated group above the non-MDD baseline. In contrast, the complicated single episode and multiple episode groups both experienced significantly higher residual symptom levels than the no-history and uncomplicated single episode groups. In sum, recovery in uncomplicated depression generally returns to population baseline levels of depressive symptoms, which is unlike the recoveries of those with other MDD. Maj 5 also argued that the 3-year follow-up may have been too short to detect recurrences in uncomplicated cases because recurrence after recovery can occur after longer intervals. He noted, for instance, that in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study, the median time to first recurrence of MDD in people who had fully recovered from their index episode was over 4 years 6. However, the baseline NESARC data used in our study were lifetime MDD data at interview 1. Thus, the duration of the follow-up was not just three years. In fact, many of the individuals classified with lifetime MDD at wave 1 had not had their last MDD episode for some years prior to the wave 1 interview, so the average time interval since recovery was potentially much greater than three years. Thus, to address Maj's concern, we calculated for each of our MDD groups the average time from the end of the last episode to the wave 1 interview to obtain a more accurate approximation of the time intervals from the last episode to the outcome reported for wave 2. The mean years of remission prior to wave 1 assessment for each group were: 9.1 (95% CI: 7.9-10.3) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=417); 9.1 (95% CI: 8.6-9.6) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=2128); and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.2) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=2501). Thus, the average time from the end of the last episode to the beginning of the wave 2 follow-up period was lengthy, about nine years for both uncomplicated and complicated single-episode cases and about four years for multiple episode cases. This substantial time interval is more than enough for elevated recurrence rates to emerge during the examined 3-year window, and such elevated rates did occur for the single-episode complicated cases but not for the uncomplicated cases at the same 9-year average time since the baseline episode. Our recent replication and extension 3 of our earlier results 1 supports the predictive validity of the uncomplicated versus complicated depression distinction across stressors, supplementing a previous study supporting concurrent validity 7. A course with elevated recurrence relative to population baselines is generally considered the single most salient identifying feature of depressive disorder versus normal sadness 8 and a primary rationale for inferring underlying dysfunction 9, yet no such elevation occurs for uncomplicated depression. The evidence thus supports two conclusions. First, uncomplicated depression is not similar to, and is typologically distinct from, major depressive disorder. Second, given the lack of differences between uncomplicated depression and no history of MDD in crucial negative sequelae including recurrence, suicide attempt, and GAD, uncomplicated depression is best interpreted as an intense normal emotional episode. The additional analyses presented here in response to Maj's 5 concerns regarding quality of recovery and duration of follow-up substantially strengthen the support for these conclusions. Jerome C.

      "abstract": "In addition to the context of psychological health, thriving can be measured in the context of physical health. Moreover, thriving may be ope rationalized at a macro level (e.g., improved functional health status following acute illness or injury) or at a micro level (e.g., hormonal balance). The goal of this article is to examine physical thriving at the micro level, by investigating hormonal responses to stressful situations. In addition, we examine the role that psychological factors play in this relationship. Although stress‐induced arousal has traditionally been viewed as negative, certain endocrine responses to stress can be health enhancing. Specifically, we propose that physical thriving results when there is a greater amount of growth promoting or anabolic hormones (e.g., growth hormone) than catabolic hormones (e.g., Cortisol). Characteristics of the stressor (duration, frequency, and controllability) as well as psychological moderators such as one's cognitive appraisal of the stressor (threat versus challenge) play a role in determining the profile of response to stress. When an individual appraises intermittent stressors as controllable, she or he may display a resilient profile of stress hormone responding—rapid Cortisol responses with quick recovery, and more importantly, Cortisol adaptation when faced with similar stressors over time. This stress response is in turn related to better health. To substantiate some of these issues, we present data from a study examining women's Cortisol reactivity in response to a repeated laboratory stressor and their self‐reported growth from facing trauma. The results suggest that women who have grown psychologically from trauma may show quicker Cortisol habituation to other stressors. Cortisol adaptation to stress may serve as one potential marker of resilient psychological and physical functioning.",

      "title": "Etiology of Depression in Children.",
      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is experienced by a significant proportion of youth today, occurring at an earlier age than found in previous generations. Major Depressive Disorder can produce long-lasting detrimental effects on a child's life, which raises the question of etiology. Three areas were examined for evidence identifying specific determinants of Major Depressive Disorder in youth: biological factors, including studies on inherited characteristics; psychological factors, focusing on cognitive and affective activity; and environmental factors, such as stressful life events. The implications of the findings were then explored. ********** The term depression is often used to describe the temporary sadness, loneliness or blues that almost everyone feels from time to time. However, the DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised) defines Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a mental illness in which a person consistently experiences deep, unshakable sadness and diminished interest in all activities for a period of at least 2 weeks. Major Depressive Disorder dramatically impairs an individual's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life. Persons with MDD usually experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of committing suicide. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses. Although depression has long been a diagnosis made for adults, it has become increasingly prevalent in the youth of today. Mental health practitioners are seeing a marked increase in the number of youth who are experiencing depression at an earlier age than did previous generations (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Depressive symptoms and disorder are found in a significant proportion of young people, with long-lasting detrimental effects (Rice, Harold and Thapar, January, 2002). Major Depressive Disorder, having such a definitive impact on a child's life, raises the question of etiology. Three major areas will be explored as to the cause of depression in children, including biological factors, psychological factors and environmental factors. Some depressions seem to occur suddenly, even when life appears to be going very well. Others have an obvious external cause such as a relationship conflict, financial difficulty or some personal failure. Yet many individuals experiencing these problems do not become depressed. In an attempt to identify causal factors, it has been hypothesized that depression results from the interaction between a person's biological and psychological vulnerabilities and a stressful life event (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Biological Factors Depression has been found to run in families (Rice, Harold, Thapar, November, 2002). By studying twins, researchers have found evidence of a strong genetic influence in depression. Genetically identical twins raised in the same environment are three times more likely to both have major depressive disorder than are fraternal twins, who have only about half their genes in common. In addition, identical twins are five times more likely to have bipolar disorder in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating manic and depressive mood swings. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression can be inherited. Adoption studies have found that children of depression are vulnerable to depression even when raised by adoptive parents, offering more evidence of a genetic role in depression. A consensus that Major Depressive Disorder is both familial and inheritable is evident in the findings from both twin and family studies (Rice et al., January 2002). Family studies of early onset Major Depressive Disorder can be differentiated by the research methodology utilized (Scourfield, Rice, Thapar, Harold, Martin and McGuffin, 2003). Bottom-up studies evaluate the inheritability of Major Depressive Disorder by examining the child and working back through the child's ancestry. …",

      "abstract": "Depression affects more than 300 million people worldwide. The condition is thought to result from a complex interaction of social, biological and psychological factors. It is characterised by persistent low mood, and/or loss of pleasure in most activities over a 2-week period. Depression can be further categorised into mild, moderate and severe depression. In adults over the age of 65 years, depression tends to be as a result of comorbidities. There are various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments available for the condition. In the primary care setting, it is important to ensure that the patient is followed up regularly. Research into the various pharmacological treatment options is most welcome in improving care for patients suffering from depression.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

      "title": "Management of chronic non-cancer pain in primary care",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mrs Yeo, a 68-year-old woman, came to you for chronic back pain, which had been persistent for the past year. She had been doctor-hopping, hoping to find an effective pain relief. About 6 months ago, she visited an orthopaedics specialist, who diagnosed her with degenerative disc disease and offered surgery, but she was not keen. Due to the back pain, Mrs Yeo stopped her part-time job 3 months ago and had been staying home more often instead of participating in community activities or interacting with her neighbours. She expressed hopelessness and lamented about the impact of the back pain on her function and lifestyle.WHAT IS CHRONIC PAIN? Chronic pain refers to pain that lasts for more than 3 months and persists past normal healing time. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, pain is defined as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage\". It is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological and social factors.[1] The perception of pain is often affected by personal life experiences, emotional factors, personal belief systems and family upbringing and values. HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE? About 8.7% of the Singapore population experiences chronic pain.[2] Within this subset, a higher prevalence of chronic pain is present among females (10.9%) and it increases significantly among people above 65 years old. Chronic pain is a risk factor for psychological disorders. A Singapore cross-sectional epidemiological survey showed that chronic pain is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio 2.4) and generalised anxiety disorder (odds ratio 3.0).[3] The economic effects of chronic pain are substantial. Another local cross-sectional study showed that episodic migraine alone posed an economic burden of SGD 1 billion per year, translating to about 2% of total government healthcare expenditure in Singapore.[4] HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? With Singapore's ageing population, the prevalence of chronic pain is expected to increase, and it will be beneficial for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) to manage uncomplicated chronic pain conditions. Complex cases may still eventually require a pain specialist's review. Chronic pain is challenging to manage in primary care. Although there are few studies conducted on the local practice of chronic pain management, some common barriers have been identified. In a local qualitative study, fellow physicians in Singapore shared that a considerable number of physicians still view chronic pain in a biomedical model rather than a biopsychosocial model. In addition, the older community often feels stigmatised or views it negatively when offered psychological treatments for chronic pain. This lack of public awareness also deters physicians from referring older persons for psychological treatment. Keeping a close and therapeutic relationship with patients, involving the family members and having consistent graduated patient education on the multifaceted nature of chronic pain were found to be helpful.[5] In our local context, chronic pain management may incur considerable costs, especially in the aspect of psychological treatment, which may not be covered under government subsidy schemes such as Medisave. This, in turn, can further deter patients from pursuing holistic treatment. FPs and GPs can look into these factors and better reach out to patients. In this article, we aim to shed light on the range of management strategies available to manage chronic pain conditions [Box 1]. Chronic pain management is complex to manage in a primary care setting and it often requires multidisciplinary co-management (FP or GP, pain specialist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and psychologist) with the necessary patient empowerment and link-up with community resources.Box 1: Common chronic non-cancer pain conditions.WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Chronic and acute pain management has some similarities, although their management differs in some regard due to the different pathophysiologies. Besides the underlying nociceptive or neuropathic pain, the perception of pain and suffering is often contributed by psychological factors, personal beliefs, life experiences and social factors such as financial struggles or litigation.[6] It should be ingrained into our daily practice to elicit and address the root causes to manage chronic pain effectively. Figure 1 shows a brief overview of an approach that can be applied in primary care. For patients with chronic pain lasting from months to years, the priority is not to eliminate pain completely, as this is often ambitious to achieve, but to improve function and quality of life. Chronic pain should be treated with a multimodal 4 'P's approach, which are Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (Physical, Psychological and Procedural) strategies. These strategies can be initiated early and concurrently for greater effectiveness and to instill confidence in the doctor–patient relationship.Figure 1: Chart shows the overview of approach to chronic pain in primary care.Non-pharmacological therapy The pathophysiology in chronic pain commonly involves central sensitisation and may be associated with underlying psychiatric conditions. Chronic pain management can be effective with non-pharmacological interventions such as physiotherapy, yoga, mindfulness, exercise, heat and cold application therapy, acupuncture, patient education and empowerment. However, the effect of these interventions was reported to be either immediate or short term, which suggests that non-pharmacological interventions should be done regularly for a sustained effect.[7] A typical physiotherapy course consists of two or three sessions each week for a duration of 8–12 weeks. Failure to show improvement within this time frame should prompt the physician to reconsider if physiotherapy is still recommended.[8] However, in the local context, due to exceeding demand for subsidised physiotherapy services, public healthcare institutions are unable to accommodate two or three sessions per week for each patient. These limited resources can be made more available and efficient by educating and empowering patients with the right mindset and attitudes towards exercise regime. Empowerment can further enable patients to sustain the efforts and reap its benefits. Pharmacological therapy Chronic pain can be broadly classified into nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. Generally, nociceptive pain is sharp and well localised, while neuropathic pain is characterised by paraesthesia (numbing, shooting, cramping sensation) and may be poorly localised. Occasionally, patients may present with both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Among patients who have end-stage knee or hip osteoarthritis, which is traditionally understood as nociceptive pain, about 35% of women and 27% of men have pain features that are suggestive of neuropathic knee pain.[9] This dichotomy can assist FPs and GPs to prescribe the appropriate pharmacological therapy. Typically, all pain should be treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pain guidelines, starting with non-opioid modalities to weak opioids and escalating to opioid therapy, with gabapentinoids and antidepressants conventionally reserved for neuropathic pain. If the pain is mild, a single analgesia can be given. For moderate or severe pain, combining multiple analgesic agents should be considered. These combination therapies have synergistic effects, which allow for lower doses of each analgesia and reduce the risks of adverse effects of each analgesia. When initiating treatment, the efficacy can be assessed after 2–4 weeks. If deemed ineffective, the medication can be switched to an alternative agent, reduced or withdrawn. The effect of pharmacological therapy is short-lived, and this may encourage patient reliance on medications in the long term, leading to higher risks of adverse effects. Hence, treatment often needs to be individualised, directed according to patients' functional limitations and goals, and kept as short a period as possible [Table 1].Table 1: Overview of common non-opioid pharmacological agents.[ 10 ]Opioid therapy Discussion surrounding opioid therapy should include the common side effects and the increased risks of opioid dependence and abuse. In line with the recent release of the Ministry of Health Opioid Guidelines, long-term opioid therapy should not be routinely prescribed.[11] If a patient is started on opioid therapy, regular assessments of the patient's response should be conducted. The doctor should consider ceasing the therapy if there is no improvement in the quality of life or achievement of functional outcomes, or if there is any suspicion of abuse. The risk factors of opioid therapy include developing comorbidities such as major depression and psychosis, suicidal tendencies and substance abuse. There are several scoring systems for prediction of aberrant use before initiation of opioid therapy, such as the 'Opioid Risk Tool' and the 'Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain' (SOAPP).[12] With these screening tools, the risks of aberrant behaviour from opioid use can be stratified as low risk, moderate risk or high risk. Low-risk patients are generally deemed reasonable to start opioid therapy in primary care. High-risk patients should be referred to pain specialist for further management. Procedural treatment Lastly, there are various types of procedures that can help manage chronic pain, such as injections and nerve blocks. Patients who are suffering from chronic back pain due to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain or post-surgery syndrome may benefit from having epidural injections.[13] There is debatable evidence for intra-articular injectables for the management of chronic knee osteoarthritis.[14] Timely referral to tertiary pain specialists and, hence, access to these procedures can help to provide synergistic effort in managing chronic pain. As a result, patients can achieve significant improvement in pain control, which will strengthen their adherence to subsequent treatments. HOW CAN I PROVIDE MORE HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT? Patients with chronic pain often have associated psychological complications such as depression and anxiety, and face social issues such as unemployment. This is especially prominent among patients with a low socioeconomic status. A local study showed that a person with chronic pain is twice as likely to face unemployment compared to a person of similar socioeconomic status without chronic pain.[15] It is challenging for FPs and GPs to thoroughly address these issues in a time-efficient manner. However, FPs and GPs can value-add by improving communication with tertiary centres, highlighting new issues and working together to best manage these psychosocial issues. There are several support groups available for patients and their caregivers, such as the Knee Osteoarthritis Improvement Group for patients with knee osteoarthritis and the Autoimmune Diseases Support Group for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TOUCH Community Services also has a community musculoskeletal clinic which is mainly run by physiotherapists. Patients facing employment woes can also approach government agencies such as Workforce Singapore, which provides training opportunities, career guidance and links to job openings. The Skillsfuture programme provides a platform to access courses and training to improve employability. National Arthritis Foundation is a charitable body which raises funds to be utilised as financial subsidies for financially needy patients for treatment or to enhance employment prospects. In addition, patient's mental well-being often suffers along with the chronic pain. Chronic pain can also bring about friction among family members as patients assume the sick role. With multiple facets of life affected, these patients may find it difficult to access help and have respite. FPs and GPs can suggest and link up the patients with available community resources. Besides the Samaritans of Singapore hotline, there are various avenues for counselling that may be helpful [Table 2]. These organisations include Silver Ribbon Singapore, which offers free basic counselling services, and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), which provides in-person counselling sessions. Other organisations may have religious roots, in which some patients may find the counselling more relatable. These include Shan You, an organisation with buddhist roots, and Calvary Community Care, which was founded by a church. Typically, churches have volunteers who provide help with counselling as well.Table 2: Summary of community resources.*WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? Doctors should refer their patients to a specialist in these scenarios: (a) the patient has persistent pain that significantly impacts on function and quality of life or causes anxiety and/or depression, and has not responded to initial management; (b) the patient continues to seek medical treatment for persistent pain that cannot be explained; (c) the patient is a possible candidate for interventional treatment; (d) the patient requires high-dose opioid therapy, shows possible opioid dependence or has a moderate-to-high risk of opioid dependence based on risk screening tools; and (e) the patient needs multimodal treatment not available in a primary care setting. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES Elucidate the cause of the pain. If the chronic pain is secondary to a mechanical pathology (i.e. spinal stenosis or osteoarthritis), explore if surgical options have been discussed. Chronic non-cancer pain often has many facets. Considering the biopsychosocial aspects of the presentation can help to identify various contributing factors and provide effective treatment. 4 'P's management: Pharmacological, Physical, Psychological and Procedural. There are numerous pharmacological treatments available, and these medications can be directed based on the type of pain and the underlying contributing disease. Opioid therapy is often associated with adverse effects, misuse and dependence. Utilising risk screening tools and regular monitoring can help to reduce these problems and allow for early detection and intervention. Patients should be empowered through patient education and understand the various treatments for better management of chronic pain. Consider other non-pharmacological treatments as a multimodal approach, especially for patients who may not be suitable for surgical treatment and aggressive pharmacological treatment due to its adverse effects. Consider psychosocial implications of chronic pain and offer management options for more holistic care. Timely referral to a tertiary centre should be considered and made in the above-mentioned situations. Closing Vignette You found out that Mrs Yeo had mild depression brought on by the chronic back pain and the resultant functional limitations. She had previously been trialled on paracetamol and short courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. You started her on combination therapy, including duloxetine, and explained to her about the biopsychosocial nature of chronic pain. On review, Mrs Yeo's pain had improved, although it was still causing functional limitations. You referred her to a pain specialist for consideration of procedural treatment, as well as a physiotherapist and psychologist. After 3 months, Mrs Yeo reported that she was feeling much better and was now able to better ambulate in the community.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper argues that the lack of strong prospective evidence linking occupational and social stress to chronic disease stems from the failure of research designs to attend sufficiently to the aetiological chronicity of such diseases. Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "The nature of the physical symptoms may imply greater depth of psychopathology, a more pervasive precipitating trauma, and/or more deeply embedded symptoms by the time the patient is seen by the psychiatrist. The psychological factors, accompanying symptoms, and treatment approaches vary widely, depending upon the patient's emotional characteristics and the specific physical disorder specified on Axis III. W. P. Ross, J. R. Schultz, and P. Edelstein described cases in which incomplete early treatment of psychologically significant stressors and the symptoms precipitated led to both medical and psychological problems in the future. An initial behavior analysis to establish a correlation between psychological factors and somatic illness should be exhaustive. Modifying patterns of communication and relationships, altering behavioral patterns, broadening the patient's perception of external and internal situations, and use of biofeedback or other conditioning techniques may be helpful for specific goals.",

If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

      "title": "Stress exposure, perceived stress severity, and their effects on health",
      "abstract": "While stress is one of the central concepts in many contemporary theories of health, there is no universal definition of stress or stressors. Stress is usually understood as a subjective experience of tension, pressure, distress, fear or negative emotions that occurs as a result of a perceived threat to one’s mental or physical well-being and is accompanied by an evolved biological response that facilitates adaptive reaction. While stress is conceptualized as a taxing condition, it is not understood as uniformly harmful per se. In fact, stress response is often cited as an adaptive reaction. Moreover, not every incident of stress exposure results in a disease or has an undermining effect on health. Mere exposure to stress does not warrant the healthy organism’s falling ill. Yet stress has been shown to affect health both directly and indirectly, having impact on multiple chronic conditions. Stressors vary in their severity and their ability to leave their mark on health, and it is therefore important to develop reliable methods of measuring stress to better understand how stress affects health and instigates pathology. One of the difficulties of measuring the effects of stress is connected to the distinction between external stressors and their internal appraisal. More recently, stress researchers began to make a distinction between stress exposure (i.e., facing an objectively measurable stressor) and perceived stress severity (i.e., a subjective experience of stress resulting from individual’s facing a stressor). The latter has been shown to have a superior predictive ability in terms of negative health outcomes (both breadth and depth of observed effects) compared to the former. Measurement-wise, subjective stress also tends to yield more precise results, which makes it preferable as a stress-assessment tool. The present article is a literature review study that delves into this distinction and attempts to shed light onto its implications for measuring stress and its effects on health.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

Chronic pain is longer and presents either with a current physical source or after its apparent healing. Chronic pain perception involves fewer physical factors and more subjective factors. Recurrent pain syndromes, commonly headache and abdominal and limb pains, are painful and without apparent physical cause; however, they do not always imply a psychological disorder.",

To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Middle age often is punctuated by recurrent episodes of stress which do not appear to have a basis in any specific event. These cycles of stress instead are a function of psychological development in mid-life, with stress resulting from the need to integrate newly differentiated aspects of experience which cannot be integrated with an existing cognitive system of beliefs and values. Reintegration of the cognitive structure to accommodate these new elements reduces the stress, leaving the adult changed with respect to certain beliefs about self or world. These reintegrations are facilitated by an internal locus of control and an articulate self-other differentiation, both of which are important for a positive response to stress in middle age.",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a primary psychotic disorder characterized by two or more of hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and/or negative symptoms. At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. There must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least six months, although the duration may be shortened with appropriate treatment. The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medications. Adjunctive psychological and social interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "During episodes of depression, patients exhibit a low mood and a number of other emotional and/or physical symptoms for a certain period of time. Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Se considera que en mas de las tres cuartas partes de los mayores deprimidos pueden persistir sintomas residuales, dando lugar a estados postdepresivos en forma de depresiones menores, depresiones subum- brales o depresiones subsindromicas. Entre estos sintomas residuales mas frecuentes en los estados postdepresivos destacan las dificultades de concentracion, el enlenteci- miento, la astenia, los sintomas somaticos, los trastornos del sueno o la hipocondriasis. En los mayores son mas frecuentes las de- presiones subclinicas o subsindromicas, que frecuentemente aparecen tras la mejoria de un trastorno depresivo mayor. Los factores que se asocian para la aparicion de estas depresiones subsindromicas son de tipo so- ciodemografico (ausencia de contactos so- ciales), empeoramiento funcional, historia previa de trastornos afectivos, antecedentes de trastornos vasculares cerebrales o facto- res existenciales (preocupaciones sobre el futuro, baja percepcion de salud,..).

Among these most prevalents residual symptoms in postdepressive states are difficulties of con- centration, bradipsychia, asthenia, somatic symptoms, sleep disorders or hypochondria- sis. In elderly people, subclinical or subsyn- dromal depressions are more prevalent, which frequently appear after the improvement of a major depressive disorder. The factors that are associated for the appearance of these subsyndromic depressions are sociodemo- graphic factors (loss of social contacts), functional impairment, previous history of affective disorders, history of cerebrovascu- lar disorders or existential factors (concerns about the future, low perception of health, ..). This form of depression tends to chronici- ty and functional impairment, and therefore treatment is recommended.

The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation. These outcomes may be a result of the physical effects of the wound, such as pain or high levels of exudate. Wound management problems, mobility issues and malodour will also have an impact on the patient’s psychological well-being. These consequences may, in turn, have a profound impact on the healing of a chronic wound and therefore affect an individual’s quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Generally the term stress refers to experiences of endangering one’s physical or psy­chological wellbeing. Physiological stress refers to bodily adaptation processes and the maintenance of body’s balance. Selye defined stress as a function of elevated corticosteroid levels and used the term stress to refer to the effects of any agent that threatens the homeostasis of the organism. The term allostasis which refers to the body’s ability to achieve stability. The allostatic load is assumed to be caused by frequent stress, lack of adaptation to repeated stress, and inability to shut down the allostatic response when the stress is over and inadequate response or dysfunction of the stress systems  Thus, psychological stress can be defined as a discrepancy between personal capacities and environmental demands. Somatic stress symptoms are related to both physiological and psychological stress. The different types of stressors are likely to elicit divergent stress reactions. The multifaceted nature of stress and various sources of stress must also be taken into account. It is important to define the stress precisely in epidemiological studies. Consequently, stress has been determined here in terms of stressful life events, experience of chronic stress, experimentally induced mental and physiological stress reactions and work stress. The work stress models that are presented here have been used extensively in studies of occupational and cardiovascular health. The inheritance of stress refers here to an innate temperament. Rationale is as follows: temperament a) has a biological basis, b) is highly inherited, and c) explains what one experiences as a stress and partly determines what the health consequences are. The common assumption in several temperament theories is that temperament plays important role in moderating stress. In the end we presented the comparative analysis between the eustress and distress.",

A 67‐year‐old man has a 46‐year history of a noiseinduced exaggerated startle reflex followed by a large amplitude rest, postural and kinetic tremor that may persist for up to 3 days. This tremor is superimposed on a continuous mild organic postural/kinetic tremor whose electrophysiological characteristics are different from those of the overlying tremor. We attribute the exaggerated startle reflex and the noise‐induced tremor to Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and postulate a psychogenic origin for the noise‐induced tremor. The patient alos believes the noise‐induced tremor to be psychologically based and to be produced by the fear and anxiety he experiences when he hears loud, unexpected noises. The sudden onset of the noise‐induced tremor, its intermittent character, its temporary disappearance on distraction despite the patient's inability to suppress it, inconsistencies in handwriting and figure drawing, and the fact that the noise‐induced tremor is stimulus specific and persists long after the offending stimulus (noise) is no longer present all suggest a tremor of psychogenic origin.",

Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

      "abstract": "Chronic depressive reactions are seen especially in patients who cannot react adequately in the face of loss, because for psychological reasons they cannot give expression to their unhappiness. Examples are the abnormal grief reactions following severe loss, and also reactions to experiences which appear outwardly trivial, but which nevertheless are damaging to self-esteem. Inability to show dissatisfaction and inhibition of one's own aggressive tendencies are characteristic of depressive neurosis. The analysis of the relevant factors, which is important for differential diagnosis, and above all in treatment, should take into account the current personal and social situation of the individual, his earlier psychological development, his constitution, any supervening physical disorder, and the influence of environmental and cultural forces.",

The onset of symptoms within 1 month (ICD) and 3 months (DSM) is not evidence based. The symptoms may be depressive, anxious, behavioural, or a mixture of these. A useful clinical indicator that the event was the trigger is that the intensity of the symptoms increases when it is being recalled or recounted and diminishes when the person is removed from it. A number of differentials should also be considered. ICD-11 proposes specific criteria for ICD-11 that include preoccupation with the stressor and difficulty adapting, as evidenced by impaired concentration, sleep disturbance, and so on, causing impairment in functioning. It is unclear whether those diagnosed with AD using the new criteria will be the same clinically as those currently so diagnosed.",

In the acute post-concussion state, it is common to feel irritable, more emotional, and to have difficulty falling asleep, which are non-specific symptoms commonly observed in anxiety disorders. Concussion injuries sometimes occur in a psychically charged environment, which may potentiate acute anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. These disorders can then potentiate prolonged post-concussion persistent symptoms. It is important to differentiate between post-concussion anxiety symptoms and the development of an anxiety disorder. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management, as needed, should address the specific anxiety manifestations.",

Stress is usually viewed as a mediator, that is, an unobservable inferred construct which is hypothesized to account for a certain observable behaviour such as health or illness differences between individuals. The early research on stress clearly documented the importance of biological bases of the stress process. The research on stress has renewed the interest in the significant influence of psychological factors in health and illness. Chronic stressors can cause neural and endocrine change that alters the normal functioning of the organism. The physiological response to stress is also accompanied by behavioural responses. Stress has direct physiological effects on the body, and the cumulative wear and tear on the system caused by recurring stress can eventually cause damage to the system.",

Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

Acute stress responses in young, healthy individuals may be adaptive and typically do not impose a health burden.

The relationship between psychosocial stressors and disease is affected by the nature, number, and persistence of the stressors as well as by the individual's biological vulnerability (i.e., genetics, constitutional factors), psychosocial resources, and learned patterns of coping.

      "title": "Chronic, Unipolar, Treatment-Resistant Mania: A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

These conditions are illnesses or impairments that are expected to last for an extended period of time and require medical attention and care that is above and beyond what would normally be expected for a child or adolescent of the same age, extensive hospitalization, or in-home health services.1 These conditions include, among others, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, spina bifida, hemophilia, seizure disorders, neuromuscular disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and congenital heart diseases. Although each specific condition may be relatively or extremely rare, when they are considered together, many children and adolescents are affected. Health conditions may be characterized by their duration and their severity. Although these terms are often linked, they refer to different aspects of a health condition. A chronic condition is generally one that has lasted or is expected to last more than a defined period of time, usually 3 months or longer. Conditions vary widely in their onset, course, and duration.2 Severity refers to the impact a condition has on a child's physical, intellectual, psychological, or social functioning.3 This impact may occur as a result of persistent symptoms, required treatments, limitations of activity or mobility, or interference with school, recreation, work, and family activities. Current estimates are that between 10 and 20 million American children and adolescents have some type of chronic health condition or impairment. Most of these conditions are relatively mild and interfere little with the children's ability to participate in usual childhood activities.4 However.",

The model is an alternative to the current event-based etiology of PTSD represented in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). The model accounts for important and reliable findings that are often inconsistent with the current diagnostic view and that have been neglected by theoretical accounts of the disorder, including the following observations. The diagnosis needs objective information about the trauma and peritraumatic emotions but uses retrospective memory reports that can have substantial biases. Negative events and emotions that do not satisfy the current diagnostic criteria for a trauma can be followed by symptoms that would otherwise qualify for PTSD. Predisposing factors that affect the current memory have large effects on symptoms. The inability-to-recall-an-important-aspect-of-the-trauma symptom does not correlate with other symptoms. Loss or enhancement of the trauma memory affects PTSD symptoms in predictable ways. Special mechanisms that apply only to traumatic memories are not needed, increasing parsimony and the knowledge that can be applied to understanding PTSD.",

      "title": "Identifying the constructs to non-melancholic depression: stress",
      "abstract": "As noted in Chapter 1, the binary model of depression viewed one ‘type’ of depression (i. e. reactive or neurotic depression) as essentially being a response to a major or salient life-event stressor. By contrast, the other type of depression (endogenous or melancholic) was seen as a condition that occurred without any such trigger, with the term ‘endogenous’ emphasising that the depression came from ‘within’ rather than from stressors and the environment. We now turn to examine the role of life-event stressors in those with non-melancholic disorders. Life-event stressors may, theoretically, be all-explanatory and contribute totally to the onset of the depressive disorder. Terms such as ‘reactive depression’ and ‘adjustment disorder with depressed mood’ emphasise the contribution of a life event and do not recognise any predisposing or other factor. While life events may vary in their magnitude, one could posit that most of these ‘pure state’ reactions are likely to be in response to cataclysmic or extremely severe depressing events, and where it might be imagined that most people would develop such a depressive condition.",

      "title": "Psychological Bases of Symptom Reporting: Perceptual and Emotional Aspects of Chemical Sensitivity",
      "abstract": "The reporting of physical symptoms is influenced to a large degree by psychological processes. Individuals are more likely to notice subtle sensations in environments lacking in stimulation than those demanding external attention. The beliefs or schemas that people hold dictate where and how they attend to their bodies as well. These normal perceptual processes help explain why people are often poor at accurately detecting internal physiological activity. Several individual differences are also related to the symptom reporting process. Females are more likely to base their symptom reports on external situational cues than are males. In addition, individuals with chronic anxiety--those high in Negative Affectivity (NA)--report more symptoms than those low in NA. Finally, individuals, who have had traumatic experiences, either in childhood or within 1-6 months prior to a major symptom reporting episode, tend to be high symptom reporters. Several recommendations are made to help researchers and clinicians distinguish between psychological or perceptual factors with presumed biological effects. One implication of this work is that MCS and allied syndromes should be viewed as both a mental and a physical health problem.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD) differ from almost every other psychiatric diagnosis in that they may only be diagnosed with reference to an aetiological event - an external traumatic stressor. ASD occurs immediately after the stressor and is comparatively short-lived, while PTSD is a prolonged abnormal response that may take months to develop. The types of stressor leading to ASD and PTSD are identical and were intended to be tightly defined, involving a perceived threat of death, serious injury or loss of physical integrity. It is useful initially to distinguish ASD and PTSD from adjustment disorders, which are also diagnosed only after an observable life event. An adjustment disorder may be thought of as a gradual and prolonged response to stressful changes in a person's life. The range of stressors precipitating an adjustment disorder is potentially much broader than that precipitating ASD or PTSD, as a threat of death or injury is not needed. Indeed, a 'threat' as such is not needed, as the event may be a loss. Events such as job loss or the breakup of a relationship may lead to an adjustment disorder, as well as threats such as accidents or assaults. The diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder do not specify what the immediate response, if any, to the precipitating stressor must be.",

They can be understood as a way to indicate suffering or to get attention and sometimes as a mean to regain self-esteem. There is little quantitative change in pain associated psychopathology and coping mechanisms in the elderly as compared to younger patients. However, qualitative changes are identified. The high degree of association between chronic pain and depression remains throughout the age span. However, age variations in the expression of psychological distress are to be noted. Elderly patients have a tendency to make a greater use of somatic complaints and avoid the expression of the emotional dimension of distress. This clinical particularity is discussed. Special attention should be paid to the multidimensional aspects of pain complaints in the elderly in order not to underestimate its affective components.",

It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms.

The biopsychosocial model proposes illness to be viewed as a result of interacting mechanisms at the biomedical, interpersonal and environmental or contextual levels.

The most typical symptoms fall into four categories, encompassing intrusive memories (e.g., periodic distressing reminders of the traumatic episode), avoidance behaviors (avoidance of people or places reminiscent of the traumatic episode), negative changes in thinking and mood, along with changes in physical and emotional responses (i.e., arousal symptoms).[1] The historical epidemiology of PTSD suggests that between 5 and 10% of the general population may be affected by this condition at some point in their lives,[2] although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has contributed to significantly increase the prevalence of PTSD, with almost 20% of COVID-19-discharged patients showing symptoms.[3] Given this concerning epidemiology, the search for effective treatment options for patients with PTSD has become increasingly important in recent years.

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy.

The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

ASD is experienced during or immediately after the trauma, lasts for at least 2 days, and either resolves within 4 weeks or the diagnosis has to be adjusted. A diagnosis of PTSD may be appropriate provided the full criteria for PTSD are met [2]. Of individuals who respond to the trauma with intense fear or horror 15–35% will eventually develop a significant degree of dysfunction and distress [3], namely PTSD, for a considerable length of time. The PTSD symptoms can be grouped into three main clusters. The first is persistent re-experience of the traumatic event, such as recurrent dreams and flashbacks. The second is persistent avoidance of internal or external cues associated with the trauma, such as avoiding thoughts, avoiding activities, diminished interest, detachment, restricted affect, and sense of foreshortened future. The third is increased arousal, which is manifested as difficulty in concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response [2]. The marked discrepancy between the proportion of the general population exposed to traumatic events and the proportion that ultimately fulfills the criteria for PTSD is a challenging aspect of the study of stress-related disorders.

Stress is defined and classified from different perspectives. Stress is a cause of tension and demand or an adaptive mechanism. Stress and the presentation of the first episode of depression are directly related, however when recurrences are present signifi cant stress loses strength among the factors that trigger it. Stressors, especially the psychosocial, are related to recurrences. Chief among these are internal and external stressors, and life events, role stress and annoyances of daily living, high demands and perfectionism. Failure to accomplish goals is another factor provoking crisis in the life cycle transition. Neuroticism and perfectionism, and dysfunctional attitudes lead to isolation and lack of social support. Dysfunctional cognitive schemes lead to erroneous information processing. Depression is a pattern of relationship failing to find adaptive ways of coping with life and conduct relationships, although there are new visions that consider it as an adaptive effort. Comorbidity can lead the recurrence of depression. It has been suggested that maladaptive cognitive patterns, in particular in interaction with stressors, could lead to poor results in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder comorbidity with personality disorder. These, regardless of the state of depression have been associated with high dysfunctional attitudes.",

      "title": "Burnout Syndrome in Professional Workers Who Deal with Treated Alcoholics",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONProfessional stress1 represents an imbalance of workplace requirements and surroundings with our abilities, wishes and expectations concerning fulfilling these requirements. The long-term exposure to professional stress results in the burnout syndrome, the most unfavorable outcome, which affects particularly the helping professions (psychiatrists, social workers, nurses...).2 One of the definitions states that the burnout syndrome is a gradual process in which once a productive and responsible worker loses all interest in his/her work or profession.3 It is a cumulative process that comes with small warning signs. Years can go by till symptoms are manifested as psychological or emotional problems as these signs are often diminutive. The burnout syndrome consists of four stages. The first stage, beginners enthusiasm is characterized by unreal expectations and self-investing of helper followed by high level of energy and good achievements. Second one is a stagnation stage in which helper starts to understand that work isn't as imagined, which is followed by the first appearance of physical and psychological exhaustion, pessimism and a lack of satisfaction with work. Isolation stage is the third stage, characterized by emotional withdrawal, avoiding contacts with colleagues, depression, negativism, angriness and hostility. Syndrome progression continues, sped by physical difficulties (chronic exhaustion, insomnia, headache, allergies etc.). Apathy and a lack of life interests, as a final stage, are the results of chronic frustration and complete lack of interest. Characteristics symptoms are loss of self-confidence, cynicism, serious emotional difficulties, not being able to communicate and work with colleagues and diminished interpersonal relations.4The burnout syndrome can be stopped before the helper arrives at the last stage. The whole process can be turned the other way around by changing the working goals, attitudes and behaviors in the work surroundings,5 as the cause of professional stress can be internal and external.The mental help of professional workers is at risk because of their everyday need to communicate with treated alcoholics, listen to the life problems, traumatic events, losses and similar issues.6 They are mostly unaware of how this line of work affects them and they avoid asking for help. Not recognizing the burnout syndrome, professional workers are themselves at risk of developing a negative attitude towards the treated alcoholics and provide ineffective and inadequate help.Aim of this study was to investigate if professional workers recognized the burnout syndrome in working with treated alcoholics; if professional workers who work with treated alcoholics suffered from burnout syndrome; which profession is the most affected by the burnout syndrome and if there were any differences in social-demographic features and to see used strategies of self-help.METHODS AND SAMPLEThe questionnaire consisted of 36 questions divided into two parts. The first part referred to professional workers' perception of the burnout syndrome and its causes, and the second part was The Burnout Syndrome Questionnaire1 (appendix).The study included 40 professional workers (doctors, social workers, nurses, psychologist, special teachers),8,9 mainly from the city of Zagreb (Table 1). 40% of them work with treated alcoholics in Departments of Psychiatry in three Zagreb University Hospitals, 37.5% work only in clubs for treated alcoholics and 22.5% work in both. The structure of professional workers in relation to the working place was expected. In hospitals, representation of nurses and doctors was highest, but in clubs for treated alcoholics there were more social workers (Table 2). The mean age of professional workers was 45 years (min. - 24, max - 68), while the mean duration of working with treated alcoholics was 15 years (min. - 1, max. - 40), which means 22 hours per week (min. …",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

They can be understood as a way to indicate suffering or to get attention and sometimes as a mean to regain self-esteem. There is little quantitative change in pain associated psychopathology and coping mechanisms in the elderly as compared to younger patients. However, qualitative changes are identified. The high degree of association between chronic pain and depression remains throughout the age span. However, age variations in the expression of psychological distress are to be noted. Elderly patients have a tendency to make a greater use of somatic complaints and avoid the expression of the emotional dimension of distress. This clinical particularity is discussed. Special attention should be paid to the multidimensional aspects of pain com- plaints in the elderly in order not to underestimate its affective components.",

      "abstract": "Living with end stage organ failure and transplantation has implications for physiological, psychological, and social well-being. The development of anxiety or depressive disorders are common with demoralization, another psychological syndrome, a topic of interest in psychiatry. To feel demoralized is to lose hope, courage, or confidence, which upsets normal functioning. While depression may co-exist with demoralization, they are 2 distinct entities, with the former characterized by an inability to experience pleasure and the latter characterized by helplessness and avoidance coping. In an effort to more adequately address the psychological stress in organ transplant patients, it is important to distinguish between demoralization and depression. Demoralization has prognostic implications such as negative disease outcomes such as treatment nonadherence and an increase risk of suicide. Medication for depression is not effective for demoralization syndrome. Therapeutic interventions include cognitive behavioral techniques that focus on exploration of attitudes toward hope and meaning in life.",

      "abstract": "We present diagnostic criteria for mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS) for inclusion into the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders. The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

The social factors are critical for a successful adaptation, while emotions are means of both signaling the organism's state and of adapting the physiological responses to environmental challenges. Hence the importance of a biopsychosocial model of health and disease. Psychoemotional distress generates and/or amplifies somatic symptoms. Somatization may be viewed as an altered cognitive process, inclining the individual to an augmented perception of bodily sensations and to an increased degree of complexity in reporting negative experiences (hence the greater cognitive effort allocated thereto). Somatosensory amplification and alexithymia are key elements in this process. The brain's right hemisphere is more involved in the generation of emotionally conditioned somatization symptoms. Somatic symptoms have various psychological and social functions and are strongly influenced by the particular belief system of the individual. Inappropriately perceiving the environment as an aggressor and excessively responding to it (by activating the cytokine system in correlation with the arousal of the psychic, nervous, and endocrine systems) may be a key element in the altered cognition conducive to ill health.",

The level of anxiety experienced by the person with social anxiety disorder is excessive, and results in substantial impairment in the sufferer's social, family, and professional life. Three distinct subtypes of the disorder have been identified: generalized social anxiety disorder, in which the individual fears a multitude of social situations; nongeneralized social anxiety disorder, in which only 2 or 3 situations are feared; and public-speaking phobia. Results from a number of studies suggest that these subtypes of social anxiety disorder may represent distinct clinical syndromes, with the generalized subtype producing the most severe disability. Despite the prevalence of social anxiety disorder and the disability it causes, this condition remains underdiagnosed, and thus undertreated, by clinicians. This review discusses the barriers that prevent people who have this disorder from seeking help, and the steps that clinicians can take to aid their recognition and treatment of the disorder. It is only by effective diagnosis and treatment that the burden of social anxiety disorder will be lifted, allowing patients to resume a normal life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Post-intensive care syndrome is defined as new or worsening impairment in cognition, mental health, or physical function that persists after a critical illness. The complexities of post-intensive care syndrome come from the interactions of the patient’s premorbid mental health and physical function, the acute physiologic derangements and acute organ injury of the critical illness, and the side effects of procedures, treatments, and potential complications incurred during the critical illness. Problems are better described as challenging syndromes rather than specific actionable diagnoses, with the four major functional problems for patients being weakness, cognitive impairment, psychological problems, and new or worsened organ dysfunction. The sequelae of critical illness often extend beyond patients and impact the families of critically ill patients.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

Although episodes of extreme fear, terror, dread, and/or the sense that “something horrible is going to happen” may be experienced with post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, or paranoid psychoses, these emotions also may be caused by seizures and other medical conditions.

      "title": "Post traumatic stress disorder in postpartum: when guilt delays recovery. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

PMS occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolves shortly after the onset of menstruation. Diagnosis depends on exclusion of other medical and psychiatric disorders. PMS can be identified based on the presence of at least one behavioral symptom and one physical symptom during the 5 days prior to menses and relieved after the onset of menses. Laboratory testing is rarely needed but may consider on an individual basis. Treatments are used in a stepwise approach with increasing order of complexity. If non-pharmacologic treatment is unsuccessful then start with the medications with the lowest side effect profiles.",

      "title": "Accident-Related Stress in the Elderly: A Review of Current Trends and Implications for Mental Health",
      "abstract": "Introduction Accidents, whether minor or severe, can have significant psychological impacts, especially in elderly populations. Stress related to accidents often exacerbates pre-existing conditions or leads to new mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The psychological impact of accidents on elderly individuals is often compounded by physical frailty, social isolation, and diminished coping mechanisms. Following an accident, elderly individuals may face prolonged recovery periods, limited mobility, and a reduced sense of independence, all of which can heighten stress levels. Additionally, the fear of future accidents may lead to avoidance behaviors, further isolating them from social interactions and routine activities, thus exacerbating anxiety and depression. Pre-existing mental health conditions, such as mild cognitive impairment or chronic illness, can worsen under accident-related stress. Objectives This study aims to explore recent trends in understanding and addressing accident-related stress in elderly individuals, focusing on the psychological, social, and physiological factors contributing to their vulnerability. The primary objective of this study is to examine the psychological, social, and physiological factors that increase the vulnerability of elderly individuals to accident-related stress. Methods A mixed-methods approach was used, combining a systematic review of literature from 2015 to 2024 and interviews with mental health professionals. The sample consisted of 30 peer-reviewed studies and 25 elderly individuals aged 65 and above who had experienced accidents within the last year. Studies were selected based on relevance to accident-related stress in the elderly, with an emphasis on post-accident psychological outcomes and interventions. Results Results indicated that the elderly are more susceptible to prolonged stress responses following accidents due to physical fragility, social isolation, and reduced coping mechanisms. The review also highlighted an underutilization of mental health services in this demographic, despite the availability of stress-reduction programs. Furthermore, findings showed that older adults who participated in targeted mental health interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and peer support groups, experienced better outcomes in managing stress compared to those who did not. Conclusions In conclusion, accident-related stress in the elderly presents unique challenges that require specialized attention. Healthcare providers should prioritize early identification and tailored interventions to mitigate the long-term psychological effects of accidents in this vulnerable population.

      "title": "CS03-04 - Concept of somatoform disorder",
      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

Uncertainty in illness is a condition that accompanies the patient from the moment of appearance of the first somatic symptoms of the disease and could be strengthened or weakened thanks to many psychosocial factors. The level of uncertainty is related to the level of stress, emotional disadaptation, affective states, coping strategies, mechanisms of psychological defense, etc. Uncertainty can perform destructive functions, acting as a trigger for stressful conditions and launching negative emotional experiences. As a positive function of uncertainty, one can note a possible positive interpretation of the patient's disease. In addition, the state of uncertainty allows the patient to activate the resources of coping with the disease, among which the leading role belongs to social support.",

ASD’s time-limited duration (3 days to 1 month) makes it distinct from, but related to, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed after 1 month. Although there are no large-scale, population-based studies of ASD, smaller studies have examined rates of ASD in select populations following a variety of traumatic events. The prevalence of ASD varies widely depending on the type of traumatic event and the population. The highest rates are in victims of sexual assault and violent crime, with more moderate rates in victims of motor vehicle accidents, burns, illness, disaster, war, and terrorism. Female gender, younger age, and a history of prior trauma, PTSD, or other mental health disorders are risk factors for ASD.",

      "title": "Whiplash headache: Does the diagnosis make more harm than the whiplash?",
      "abstract": "According to the study of Obermann et al. in the current issue of Cephalalgia, headache after whiplash injury is a self-limiting condition with a good prognosis. Although 4.6% fulfilled criteria for chronic whiplash headache, i.e. still having headache after 3 months, none had headache lasting more than 1 year. Predictors for headache lasting > 3 months were medication overuse, pre-existing pain conditions, and several psychological factors. Another factor, sore throat after the whiplash, was somewhat speculatively interpreted as a possible result of musculoskeletal damage. The headaches were mostly compatible with tension-type headache (TTH). Although the study has a positive message, that the headache subsides in less than a year, it also demonstrates some very problematic aspects of the whiplash headache entity. First, the criteria contain no description of the headache itself. It is sufficient that the headache and neck pain occur within 7 days after an event with a possible whiplash mechanism. For the chronic whiplash headache, it is required that the headache persists for > 3 months after the accident, but there is no requirement that the headache occurs with a certain frequency. This is in contrast to, for example, chronic TTH, where the headache must occur on more than half of the days for > 3 months. Quite wisely, therefore, the authors have in their definition of chronic headache added the requirement that the headache shall occur daily or near daily. Nevertheless, to find enough patients with ‘chronic’ headache for the analysis, they also used the criteria of the Quebec task force (QTF), but also these criteria have no definition of chronicity. An even more problematic aspect of the chronic whiplash headache entity is that, according to the very lax International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) criteria, in principle any headache that occurs in an individual for years after the event can be classified as chronic whiplash headache, provided that there was head and neck pain during the first week. This is so even though this single event leaves no trace in the body that can be demonstrated by objective means, and even if the headache resembles the naturally occurring primary headaches, as demonstrated in this and previous studies (1,2). This issue is even more crucial after the demonstration that even sham whiplash accidents, involving virtually no physical forces but many psychological stressors, could induce head and neck pain in up to 20% of the exposed individuals within the first days after the event (3), hence allowing a diagnosis of whiplash headache according to the current ICHD-II criteria. Thus, it may be that so-called whiplash headache mostly or even exclusively represents primary headache induced by the stress of the situation (2). Theoretically, it is highly unsatisfactory to have a headache category named after each type of precipitant for headache episodes, psychological or other. From a practical viewpoint, it is probably unsound to name the headache after the whiplash event if the headache is a primary headache, particularly since most patients and health professionals will then tend to understand the aetiology in terms of a physical injury to head and neck structures. Many unhealthy practices (e.g. use of a neck collar, hazardous neck operations) that may increase the complaints stem from a traumatic conception of the headache, and the prognosis of headache after rear-end collisions seems to be best in cultures where the traumatic event is ignored (4). In the present study the incidence of chronic headache is consistent with the prevalence figures of chronic headache seen in population-based studies, and the authors wisely comment that development of chronicity in this whiplash group may have similar pathophysiological or clinical mechanisms to chronic headache in general. In my opinion, this raises the issue of whether whiplash headache is a biologically meaningful entity, i.e. caused by injury to head or neck structures. To solve this problem, descriptive case series based on patients presenting in an emergency room or to a",

      "abstract": "Traumatic stress takes different forms in different sociocultural contexts. It is more reasonable to include covert and apparently nontraumatic stress as a factor contributing to dissociative disorders, rather than to limit our attention to overt and stereotyped forms of trauma, such as childhood sexual and physical abuse. Despite their different manifestations, covert stress and overt stress may cause dissociative pathology under certain conditions. This condition could be the suppression of projection and externalization of negative mental contents under a given stress. The author would like to call this form of stress `dissociogenic stress.' Whether or not an individual develops a dissociative disorder as a result of dissociogenic stress also depends on the individual's constitutionally based dissociative and hypnotic tendency.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain: What Does It Mean? A Review on the Use of the Term Chronic Pain in Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Chronic pain is nowadays used as an umbrella term referring to a wide range of clinical conditions, such as fibromyalgia, migraine, or long-standing pain states without actual known causes. However, labeling a patient's clinical condition with the term \"chronic pain\", when dealing with pain lasting longer than 3 months, might be misleading. This paper aims at analyzing the possible pitfalls related to the use of the term \"chronic pain\" in the clinical field. It appears, indeed, that the term \"chronic pain\" shows a semantic inaccuracy on the basis of emerging scientific evidences on the pathogenesis of different long-standing pain states. The major pitfalls in using this label emerge in clinical settings, especially with patients having a biomedical perspective on pain or from different cultures, or with healthcare providers of other medical specialties or different disciplines. A label solely emphasizing temporal features does not help to discern the multifaceted complexity of long-standing pain states, whose onset, maintenance and exacerbation are influenced by a complex and interdependent set of bio-psycho-social factors. Thus, finding a more meaningful name might be important. We call upon the necessity of bringing awareness and implementing educational activities for healthcare providers, as well as for the public, on the biopsychosocial approach to assess, prevent and care of chronic pain. Further research on the etiopathogenetic processes of chronic pain states is also required, together with examinative diagnostic methods, to individuate the most appropriate label(s) representing the complex long-standing pain states and to avoid adopting the term \"chronic pain\" inappropriately.

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is conceptualized as an excessive and/or unreasonable fear of situations in which the person’s behavior or appearance might be scrutinized and evaluated. This fear is a consequence of the person’s expectation to be judged negatively, which might lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Typical examples of feared and usually avoided social situations are giving a talk in public, performing other tasks in front of others, and interacting with people in general. Although the existence of SAD as a psychopathological entity has been known for at least 100 years, it was only relatively recently, with the publication of DSM-III in 1980, that SAD (or social phobia) acquired the status of an ‘‘official’’ psychiatric diagnosis. The term social anxiety disorder has been increasingly used instead of social phobia, because it is felt that the use of the former term conveys more strongly the pervasiveness and impairment associated with the condition and that this term will promote better recognition of the disorder and contribute to better differentiation from specific phobia (Liebowitz et al., 2000). Like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder is common and controversial. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, which is described in different ways by different diagnostic criteria and different researchers and clinicians, SAD does not suffer from a ‘‘description problem.’’ It is not particularly difficult to recognize features of SAD; what may be difficult is making sense of these features. Main issues associated with SAD are listed below…. 1. Where are the boundaries of SAD? How well is SAD distinguished from ‘‘normal’’ social anxiety and shyness on one hand, and from severe psychopathology on the other? 2. Is there a danger of ‘‘pathologizing’’ intense social anxiety by labeling it a psychiatric disorder? How can the distress and suffering of people with high levels of social anxiety be acknowledged if they are not given the corresponding diagnostic label? 3. Is SAD a bona fide mental disorder? 4. Can the subtyping scheme (nongeneralized vs. generalized SAD) be supported? 5. Is there a spectrum of social anxiety disorders?",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

      "abstract": "Ten years research into the physical and psychosocial consequences of severe brain damage in adults has revealed substantial information about the process of recovery. The main features are evidence that the greater part of physical and mental recovery occurs within six months of injury and that in most cases the mental consequences of injury outweigh the physical ones and place the greater burden upon the injured person's relatives. Impairment of memory is the most common cognitive disorder and alterations in personality often occur also and are the most taxing of the mental deficits for all concerned. The process of recovery has three stages, in the first the patient is unconscious, in the second he or she regains full consciousness signified by the end of the period of post traumatic amnesia and continues to show evidence of rapid improvement in basic physical and mental functions. The rate of recovery shows within six months of injury in most cases and this represents the end of the second stage. In the third stage, which may last for many months, both the patient and his or her relatives adapt to the residual disabilities of the former. Methods of managing the three stages should include physical, psychological and social techniques and the way in which they may be linked to the patients' differing physical and psychosocial needs during the three stages of recovery are briefly discussed.",

Children with DMDD showed a low frustation tolerance and experiencing difficulty in regulating emotions, low tolerance in a state of distress and trouble in controlling behaviors. Between attack, children showed persistent irritability mood throughthout the day which can be observed by parents, teachers and peers. Diagnosis is made when this disorder lasts in at least two settings in different places (home, school, neighborhood). Onset of symptoms before age 10 years, but diagnose can't be made before the age of 6 years and above 18 years. Symptoms that stick out are chronic irritability, known by Leibenluft as severe mood dysregulation (SMD), which in the DSM V known as DMDD. Chronicity of symptoms indicating a mismatch with symptoms episode according to DSM IV, where manic episode lasts at least 4 days and hypomania for at least one week. Based on the results of researches, DMDD will evolve into anxiety and depression disorders, and not a bipolar disorder in adulthood. SMD can be distinguished from DmDD by the onset of age and the presence of hyperarousal. In SMD, hyperarousal symptoms can be found on an episode of mania and sometimes on ADHD, chronic, and non episodic irritability with onset before 12 years of age. There has been no appropriate tools to assess and diagnose DMDD. Child Behavior Checklist Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP) can be used as a tool to identify patients with severe mood disorders. High Scoring indicate persistence problems with bad outcomes such as substance abuse, suicidality, and functional disorders in facing life.",

      "title": "Overtraining from a sports psychiatry perspective",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is characterized by a mismatch between exerted strain and exercise tolerance. Overtraining is generally not sufficiently feared nor is enough attention paid to its prevention. As a result, the first warning signals and symptoms are often either perceived too late or there is a delay in the correct interpretation of signs. This often leads to negative consequences over months, which, in turn, can lead to more frequent injuries as well as Depression. Due to the increasing professionalism and density of competition in competitive sports, overtraining occurs more frequently as athletes are left with a shorter period of time to recover. In order to treat overtraining, it is first necessary to identify the syndrome. Symptoms are often disregarded and trainers and athletes attempt to compensate for poor performance with excessive training. This leads to a vicious cycle with significant reduction of the overall performance of the athlete as a consequence. Psychological parameters can also be signs of non-func-tional overload. Examples include restlessness, irritability, emotional instability, recurring states of fear, emerging indifference or reduced performance motivation. However, disturbed cognitive processes as an impairment of central elements of movement control can also occur. As part of sports psychiatric support, conspicuous psychological parameters can be recorded and contextualised. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) is available for systematic recording and corresponding process management. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) can be used as an instrument for load, training and competition control to prevent non-functional overload and overtraining. It is also suitable for promoting performance and preventing injuries as well as stabilizing the psychological structure.

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

      "abstract": "Both painful and nonpainful somatic symptoms essentially characterize clinical states of depressive mood. So far, this well-established psychopathological knowledge has been appreciated only insufficiently by the official diagnostic systerms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV TR) and the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (ICD-10). From a perspective of primary care services, this unmet diagnostic need is deplorable, as the main mode of presenting a depression is by reporting somatic symptoms. This somatic form of presentation, however, significantly contributes to low rates of recognition in primary care. A diagnostic challenge may be seen in the differentiation of a depression with prevailing somatic symptoms from anxiety, somatoform disorders, and medical conditions. When somatic symptoms, particularly painful physical conditions, accompany the already debilitating psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of depression, the course of the illness may be more severe, implying a higher risk of early relapse, chronicity, suicide, or mortality due to other natural causes, the economic burden increases considerably the functional status may be hampered heavily, and health-related quality of life may be lowered dramatically. The neurobiological underpinnings of somatic symptoms in depression may guide more promising treatment approaches.",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

Worry is a cognitive activity that involves repeatedly thinking about potential negative future events, such as “What if I can't finish this task?” “What if I never graduate?” “What if I have some type of illness?” According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), in order to warrant a diagnosis of GAD an individual must experience excessive and uncontrollable worry for at least 6 months, as well as three or more associated symptoms that are present, more days than not, over this time period. These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

The stimuli are called stressors and physiological and behavioral changes in response to exposure to stressors constitute the stress response. A stress response is mediated by a complex interplay of nervous, endocrine, and immune mechanisms that involves activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and immune system. The stress response is adaptive, to begin with, that prepares the body to handle the challenges presented by an internal or external environmental challenge (stressor) e.g., the body's physiologic responses to trauma and invasive surgery serve to attenuate further tissue damage. But if the exposure to a stressor is actually or perceived as intense, repetitive (repeated acute stress), or prolonged (chronic stress), the stress response becomes maladaptive and detrimental to physiology e.g., exposure to chronic stressors can cause maladaptive reactions including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and heart disease.",

      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that persists or recurs more than three months and may extend beyond the expected time of healing. Recently, nociplastic pain has been introduced as a descriptor of the mechanism of pain, which is due to the disturbance of neural processing without actual or potential tissue damage, appearing to replace a concept of psychogenic pain. An interdisciplinary task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) compiled a systematic classification of clinical conditions associated with chronic pain, which was published in 2018 and will officially come into effect in 2022 in the 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization. ICD-11 offers the option for recording the presence of psychological or social factors in chronic pain; however, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions in the pathogenesis of chronic pain are missing. Earlier pain disorder was defined as a condition with chronic pain associated with psychological factors, but it was replaced with somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) in 2013. Recently clinical nosology is trending toward highlighting neurological pathology of chronic pain, discounting psychological or social factors in the pathogenesis of pain. This review article discusses components of the pain pathway, the component-based mechanisms of pain, central and peripheral sensitization, roles of chronic inflammation, and the involvement of tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolites, exploring the participation of psychosocial and behavioral factors in central sensitization of diseases progressing into the development of chronic pain, comorbid diseases that commonly present a symptom of chronic pain, and psychiatric disorders that manifest chronic pain without obvious actual or potential tissue damage.",

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

This period prior to relapse is known as the 'prodromal period' and is normally characterised by changes in the person's mood, behaviour and thoughts, which usually appear 2–6 weeks prior to relapse.",

The present factor analytic study examines 35 distinct depressive symptoms in three depressed samples and supports the conceptualization of D. F. Klein (Endomorphic depression. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 31: 447–454, 1974) that endogeneity and reactivity can be construed as orthogonal, independent dimensions. Symptoms consistently loading on an endogeneity factor are: 1) lacking in reactivity to environmental changes; 2) showing no interest in life; 3) retarded (slow, feeling tired, etc.); 4) feeling unable to act; 5) considering self lazy; 6) feeling helpless and powerless; and 7) perceiving depression as qualitatively different from ordinary sadness. Symptoms consistently loading on a reactivity factor are: 1) feeling that he or she is bearing troubles; 2) presence of precipitating stress; 3) crediting problems to excessive family and/or job responsibilities; 4) expressing concern for welfare of family and friends; 5) visceral symptoms; 6) feeling at \"end of rope\"; 7) having middle-of-the-night insomnia; and 8) showing self-pity. The results suggest a methodology for identifying depressives who are high-high, low-high, high-low, and low-low on the endogeneity and reactivity factors.",

      "title": "The influence of chronic stress on health and coping mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Stress represents a negative life experience, closely followed by physiological, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes that focus on changing the event or adapting to its effects. Any situation or occurrence that requires adaptation can be experienced as a stress, even positive situations and circumstances may be stressful, whether they come from the outside world, or the sources of stress is internal. While acute stress does not necessarily have a negative effect, if it lasts for a long time, or is frequently repeated, it becomes chronic, and can cause various serious disorders. During chronic stress, there is an exhaustion of the body's capacity for an adequate reaction, which can lead to long-lasting immunological dysfunction, which significantly impairs health and quality of life. According to the WHO (2017), stress is one of the causes of even 60% known diseases, and in a number of mental disorders a direct connection with stress has been reported: in acute stress reactions, \"posttraumatic stress disorder\", adjustment disorders and other reactions to severe stress. In addition, in all categories of mental disorders (ICD-10), the stressful situation or event plays a significant role in occurrence of the symptoms. A particular category of stress-related disorders are psychosomatic disorders. These are functional disorders in which there is no pathoanatomic substrate. In contrast to these, psychosomatic diseases are the type of illness in which there are structural changes of tissues and organs, the etiology of which is based on chronic stress, in addition to a number of other factors (Adamović, 1983) and which occur when there is a biological predisposition. The paper presents the mechanism of development of these diseases and some of the ways of coping with stress. According to the DSM-V, psychosomatic diseases are divided into skin diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory diseases, heart and blood vessel diseases, disorders of endocrine glands, rheumatoid diseases, gynecological diseases and others. In order to overcome stress and preserve health, psychological strategies for coping with stress play an important role. Multiple strategies are used, which include various stress control techniques: relaxation techniques, meditation methods, and assertive training, biofeedback and stress inoculation techniques. Successful mastering of coping stressful situations, constructive problem solving in life crisis, relaxation techniques and contributions to better adaptation to unexpected changes in life are of key importance for both mental and physical health.",

      "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of as a response to chronic sexual victimisation and considers what this means for services and service configurations, as well as the implications of acknowledging for policy responses in health and human service fields. Abstract: Traumatic events are those that overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life. However, one particular type of is increasingly being recognised as a driver of many social and mental health problems in those affected by it. The repeated caused by ongoing sexual abuse that is prolonged, occurs in the developmental stages of a person's life, and is often perpetrated by an authority figure is now being more readily perceived as a causal feature of multiple social and mental health issues and the consequent need for human services. Although not officially recognised in diagnostic classification, the term complex trauma or complex post-traumatic stress describes a broad-ranging set of disorders, symptoms and social problems that are not captured by a limited diagnostic category of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). People suffering need treatments that are multifaceted and varied to accommodate their particular range of symptoms. Isolated treatment of particular symptoms may only impact on one aspect of their needs and will not resolve the underlying issues that have created the problem. Key points: The mental health impacts of sexual victimisation are frequently acknowledged but there are specific and additional impacts where victims have suffered a particular type of abuse that is: interpersonal, commences at an age where emotional development is affected, is ongoing, chronic or features multiple types of abuse. Many researchers and practitioners in the fields of psychiatry, psychology and social work do not see the mental health diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as sufficient to capture these specific effects of multiple types of abuse and chronic victimisation. There have been calls for an additional category called complex PTSD or complex trauma. The impacts of symptomatology on victim/survivors can be a driver of need for many human services, including mental health, medical and substance abuse services as well as social services like housing and relationship services. Acknowledging an underlying basis of could enhance service delivery to the victim/survivor that may have multiple needs across services. It is important to acknowledge the link between ongoing sexual victimisation and in order to facilitate a cultural shift towards the connectedness of services and a person-centred approach to service use.",

      "title": "Validation of Stress Assessment Using Mobile Phone",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONStress is a universally experienced phenomenon. It represents a continuum which no single definition can encompass. Stress is considered as an external load or demand on a biological, social or psychological system (Lazarus, 1993). In general terms, stress is defined as the reaction of an organism to a change in its equilibrium. More commonly it is referred to, as, the tension one experiences in response to a threat (Lu et al., 2012). Cumulative stress in daily life impacts negatively on health and societal well-being. Stress being highly pervasive, is widely accepted as the leading cause of illness and diseases. This presents an inherent need to detect and monitor stress as a pre-requisite for eliminating stress and diseases caused due to stress. Yet, despite the scientific advances of modern times, stress continues to be measured only through a self declared questionnaire. Such a questionnaire has several limitations, including lack of portability to measure frequently.Physiologic responses to stress could be used as markers to quantify stress. As a rule, stress does not exist in the absence of stressors. Stressors are stimuli which evoke stress responses. They could be real or imagined, physical or psychological. Physical stressors pose a threat to a person's physical equilibrium such as an electric shock, prolonged exercise, or deprivation of sleep. A psychological stressor on the other hand could be an event that poses a threat to an individual's self-esteem, e.g., the pressure of solving a difficult mental task within a time limit (Lu et al., 2012). It has been recognized that all stressors, whether physical or psychological elicit the same physiological response. Among the various physiological responses to stress such as, changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature, respiration, skin conductance etc., cortisol responses function as the chief biomarker of stress. Largest cortisol responses entailing longest time for recovery are found to occur as a result of acute psychological stressors. (Dickerson and Kenney, 2004) These stressors refer to tasks of motivated performance (public speaking and mental arithmetic) with both uncontrollable and social evaluative elements (i.e., task performance could be negatively judged by others) present in them.On the other hand, it has been widely acknowledged (Hecker, Stevens, von Bismarck and Williams, 1968, Scherer, 1986., Tolkmitt and Scherer, 1986) that human voice is influenced by stress. According to Chang, Fischer and Canny (2011) the human voice encodes a wealth of information about emotion, mood and mental state. Variations in speaking fundamental frequency, duration (Griffin and Williams, 1987) amplitude (Brenner and Shipp, 1987) etc., provide for changes in acoustic speech signal that are measured as correlates of stress. Alterations in acoustic signals could be an outcome of changes in respiration during stress. Rate of respiration increases during stress, as a result, sub glottal pressure increases during speech. This in turn increases fundamental frequency or pitch of voice. Increased rate of respiration decreases duration of speech between breaths. Dryness of mouth, activity of the muscles of the larynx, vibrating vocal cords affect the volume velocity through the glottis and thereby fundamental frequency which contribute to changes in speech production under stress. These facts tender human voice as a potential source for stress detection. Voice features that could be influenced by stress include loudness, fundamental frequency, jitter, zero-crossing rate, speech rate and high-energy frequency ratio (Rothkrantz, Wiggers, van Wees and van Vark, 2004). Utilizing these facts the stressMobile-a tool developed to assess stress, demonstrates the possibility of quantifying stress levels from voice features recorded in a mobile phone.The present investigation was conducted to validate stress assessment using stressMobile against salivary cortisol responses to psychologically induced stress task on a sample of university students. …",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

A key challenge in delivering such interventions is understanding how PTSD symptoms develop in the acute post-trauma period, defined as the first 30 days after a trauma. Mobile devices have the potential to transform the way symptoms are assessed and how treatment is delivered in that they can capture the dynamic and nuanced nature of symptom progression after trauma. Symptoms can be assessed through active strategies that require user input, such as self-report, or through passive strategies, such as location information. Adaptive mobile interventions can be tailored to target PTSD symptoms as they appear and ultimately prevent more chronic courses of illness.

The connection between traumatic experiences and a specific mental disorder has become part of the general discourse. PTSD provides a cultural template of the human response to war, violence, disaster, or very bad personal experiences. The DSM-III revolutionized American psychiatry. The manual’s editors wanted a symptom-based, descriptive classification and generally rejected any reference to causal theories about mental processes. PTSD was an exception to the rule of creating a classification that is ‘‘atheoretical with regard to etiology or pathophysiological process’’ (American Psychiatric Association, 1980 p. 7), but the exception was not noted anywhere in the manual. Not only did the PTSD definition include an etiological event, but it incorporated a theory, an underlying process, that connects the syndrome’s diagnostic features (McNally, 2003; Young, 1995). In 1994, the American Psychiatric Association published the fourth edition of the DSM. The definition of PTSD, which had already undergone some revisions in DSM-IIIR, maintained the syndrome’s description but changed materially the stressor criterion. The range of events was widened, and the emphasis shifted to the subjective experience of victims. The list of ‘‘typical’’ traumas in the DSM-IV left no doubt that the intent was to enlarge the variety of experiences that can be used to diagnose PTSD beyond the initial conception of directly experienced, life-threatening events such as combat, natural disaster, rape, and other assault. Persons who learned about a threat to the physical integrity of another person or about a traumatic event experienced by a friend could be considered victims. A novel form of PTSD took shape following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when the entire population of the United States was considered to have been affected by a ‘‘distant’’ trauma, produced chiefly by viewing television coverage.",

Although typically conceptualized as an adult disorder, psychosis often emerges in adolescence, and earlier onset is associated with poorer prognosis. Not surprisingly, longer periods of untreated illness have been linked to poorer clinical, functional, and cognitive outcomes. This indicates a critical need to bolster symptom recognition and early treatment efforts to maximize recovery and minimize the personal and financial sequelae of illness.",

The relationship between depression and CFS is unclear and may be explained by one of four models: (1) CFS is an atypical manifestation of MDE; (2) depression is the result of CFS as either an organic mood syndrome or an adjustment reaction; (3) CFS and MDE are covariates; and (4) the diagnosis of MDE is artifactual. The evidence for these models is discussed. The potentially confounding effect of depression on tests of immune function and neuropsychological testing is described. The implications of these different models for the design of studies of CFS are examined.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

Often this stress breaks the tolerance threshold and causes deteriorating effects on an individual’s mental, physical, and emotional life. This effect is known as Burnout. In medical terms, Burnout is a psychiatric syndrome in response to chronic stress at work. This paper discusses the causes, mitigating factors, and various models of burnout. Also discuss the implications of this phenomenon due to its high relevancy and presence in our 21st-century work culture, where people are seriously overworked and exhausted. Burnout often stays disguised and can reduce a person’s wellbeing and productivity over time, not to mention causing chronic health issues, hence it is important to be aware and recognize this before it gets too late.",

The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

On the other hand, physical activity, a stressor in and of itself, provides beneficial adaptations rather than deleterious effects to the body in animals and in humans. This chapter highlights the dynamic physiological adaptations that occur in peripheral tissues in response to both physical activity and chronic psychological stress. In humans, the definition of a stressor becomes even more complex and may include adversity endured in a number of social and emotional situations and remains difficult to simulate within the laboratory setting. Challenges in the investigation of the physiological adaptations that occur with exercise and stress include the variability of the stressors used, difficulty in quantifying the stress response, and a lack of uniformity in techniques employed to assess the stress response.",

Depending on several factors, including level of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, and neuroimaging findings, brain injuries are classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Individuals with moderate to severe injuries have worse cognitive, emotional, and functional outcomes and exhibit a more prolonged recovery than those with mild injuries. Although mild injuries are usually associated with short-term cognitive and emotional difficulties that resolve within weeks, sometimes symptoms persist longer than three months. These prolonged or post-concussion syndrome symptoms are not related to the injury itself but rather are influenced by prior and current psychological symptoms. As individuals with varying levels of brain injury progress through acute, subacute, and chronic stages of their recovery, neuropsychological evaluations are used to assess cognitive and emotional functioning, predict outcomes, and provide treatment recommendations.",

Developmentally, there has been a deficit in the child's experience of shared pleasure, and of being a source of enjoyment to the parent. Instead, the child experiences himself or herself as a source of pain and feels responsible for the parent's dysphoric, anhedonic state. This is not simply a fantasy construction of the child, as parental reproachfulness is characteristically encountered. The child makes reparative efforts, but they generally do not succeed. Central psychological capacities are compromised under these conditions, particularly a sense of personal efficacy and of natural entitlement. The evolution of initiative, autonomy, and individuation are also significantly affected. The aggression, both conscious and unconscious, which is generated by these early conditions creates intrapsychic conflict which further inhibits the development of these essential psychological functions. Some therapeutic recommendations are proposed based on these considerations.",

Medical training is identified as full of stress\r\nand it is also observed that students undergo tremendous stress during various years of medical training. In\r\nmany medical schools, the environment itself is an all prevailing pressure situation, providing an authoritarian\r\nand rigid system, one that encourages competition rather than cooperation between learners .

The stress may also reach burnout levels",

      "abstract": "Most people have periods in which they become at least moderately depressed: they feel sad, they lose their motivation and interest in their usual activities, they slow down and are chronically fatigued, and so on. For most people, these periods last only a few days and their symptoms never become debilitating. For others, these periods last weeks or months, and their symptoms become worse with time. I suggest that the ways people initially try to regulate or cope with their symptoms of depression can affect the severity and duration of these symptoms. Specifically, people who have a ruminative style of responding to their initial symptoms of depression will have longer and more severe episodes of depressed mood than people who have more active, less ruminative response styles. A ruminative response style for depression is defined as the tendency to focus passively and repetitively on one's symptoms of depression and on the possible causes and consequences of those symptoms without taking action to relieve them. Ruminative responses to depression exacerbate and prolong periods of depression through at least three mechanisms. First, rumination enhances the negative effects of depressed mood on thinking, making depressive interpretations of events and negative memories more accessible and more likely to be used in ongoing deliberations about one's life. Second, rumination interferes with complex interpersonal problem-solving, in part because it enhances pessimistic, distorted thinking. Third, rumination inhibits people from engaging in everyday instrumental behaviors that could enhance their sense of control and lift their moods.",

It is important to treat these main consequences instead of peripheral symptoms in isolation. Continuous activity programming tailored to dementia severity prevents many behavioural symptoms of dementia. Environmental influences affecting behavioural symptoms of dementia include caregiving strategies, social environment, physical environment and medical interventions. Caregiving strategies are most important in preventing escalation of rejection of care into combative behaviour that is sometimes labelled 'aggression'. Patients often reject care because they do not understand caregiver motives or because they are depressed. Special care dementia units facilitate management of behavioural symptoms of dementia. Medical interventions should be congruent with goals of care and avoid unnecessary aggressive procedures that increase behavioural symptoms of dementia.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development.

      "title": "STRESS AND HEART",
      "abstract": "Background : Human beings throughout the world are faced with high and ever increasing levels of acute or chronic stress. Acute stress is defined as “the normal short-term physiological response to the perception of major threat or demands”. Chronic stress is defined as “the abnormal ongoing physiological response to the continuing perception of irresolvable major threats or demands”. 1 In fact, all these modern definitions of stress date back to the time of Hans Selye, the first scientist who studied the effects of stress on health and physiological integrity of living organisms. 2 Accordingly, the term stress pertains to effects of all environmental and psychosocial factors on physical or mental well-being. 1 The effect of stress on cardiovascular system has bean discussed for many years, 3 although until recently, the evidence has been relatively weak due to the complexity of such a relationship. 4 Among the many different types of stressors, mental and psychosocial stressors exert profound effects on the circulatory system. Primary studies on the relationship of stress with cardiovascular disease focused mainly on type A personality, then shifting to more specific components, i.e. hostility and anger, as stressful factors that provoke cardiovascular problems. 5 Behavioral or psychosocial stress induces or influences the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect. Psychosocial stress has been demonstrated to increase oxidative stress which disturbs endothelial integrity and induces endothelial injury and dysfunction. 6 These processes activate beta 1-adrenoceptors that cause sympathoadrenal activation, which in turn enhances atherosclerosis. Also, behavioral or psychosocial stressors decrease estrogen, which may be of importance for the development of premenopausal atherosclerosis. 7 (1) HamidReza Roohafza MD. Psychiatrist,  Mental Health Research Unit, Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center. Email: roohafza@crc.mui.ac.ir Stress is strongly associated with CAD. Clinically, mental stress is a cause of angina and may specifically worsen CAD. By provoking a dynamic decrease in coronary supply, mental stress may activate the ischemic response and induce substantial myocardial ischemia, and in the long term adversely affect prognosis in CAD patients. 8,9 Hostility and anger have also been shown to negatively influence ejection fraction and myocardial blood circulation, pointing out the importance of these phenomena as the etiology of CAD. 5 However, other forms of stress also have an impact. Behavioral/ psychosocial stress may participate in the development of CAD, via neuroendocrine mediation through sympathoadrenal activation (chronic sympathetic hyperarousal), seen clinically in angina/chest pain associated with normal coronary angiograms. 10 Stress clearly has the potential to actively trigger threatening cardiac events that lead to myocardial infarction. Mental stress increases the myocardial oxygen demand via sympathoadrenal activation and also involves a reduction in the myocardial oxygen supply, an eventually fatal consequence. 11 Mental stress obviously has a profound impact on long-term cardiac events and outcome. In particular, mental stress may cause paradoxical constrictions in patients with CAD/atherosclerosis, especially at points of stenosis - a response that correlates with the extent of atherosclerosis (plaque) and with the endothelium-dependent response to an infusion of acetylcholine (verification of endothelial dysfunction). 12 Discussion : Stress contributes to the onset, development, progression, and treatment delay of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of stress is high in both developing and developed countries, 13 an example of which is a large multicomponent interventional project on lifestyle habits performed in Iran, named Isfahan Healthy Heart Program, the results of which show high stress levels in 40% of men and 45% of women. 14 Thus, ‘lifestyle’ needs to be a central focus of prevention, 13 as this ‘epidemic of stress’ 1 may turn into a critical medical issue. Stress management interventions such as cognitive behavioral strategies to improve adaptive methods, and the use of relaxation response techniques are of growing importance in the future. 14",

These disorders may be defined as morbid changes in the muscles, tendons, joints and vertebral column, arising as the result of malfunction or over-function, i.e. stresses which with time or through intensity exceed the limit for the strength of the tissues. The disorders are caused by physical and/or psycho-social circumstances. In treating the different forms of stress disorders, physical activity has been utilised with good results. Training is believed to work both through its favourable effect on the function and physical strength of the various tissues and through its general capacity for relaxing the musculature.",

Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood. Further examination of the patient's history however often revealed previous evidence of emotional disturbance, or of instability in other members of her family.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

Of particular interest here are situations characterized by brief stressor exposure but long‐term threat perception and/ or stress response. Traumatic events are ordinarily very brief but frequently give rise to chronic threat and stubborn response patterns. In many of these cases, distress clearly outlives the event and the “normal” postevent recovery period.

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) are reported to be among the most prevalent and unfavourable mental disorders in the individuals who have gone through life-threatening situations. For the late decades, they have been standing out against the background of marginal mental disorders. PTSDs are caused by an individual’s direct involvement in the stress event, fraught with grave consequences and accompanied by mortal fear, horror and sensation of powerlessness. The problem is pressing for the today’sUkrainein view of theDonbaswarfare, mass resettlement, changes of job and forms of activity. The disease may be diagnosed as PTSD in the case the groups of symptoms persist more than a month since a traumatic event has occurred. For a long time, a good many of soldiers have been reported to reveal anxiety-phobic and behavioural disorders, as well as the signs of organic cerebral lesion. Some of them occur during combat operations, whereas the most of symptoms develop and aggravate 1-2 years after coming home. The PTSD patients mostly develop insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased aggressiveness, which cause conflicts. An individual may become wicked, aggressive, discontented and cynical on a social basis. Depressive symptoms are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PTSD and aggression. The ATO men with PTSD, who do not take alcohol, develop depression 1-1.5 year after coming back and, with alcohol added, the problem of aggression arises. Based on this, we suggest that a staff of personnel, trained in psychological aid to the combatants with PTSD, should be formed. Besides, our cases prove that, with friendly support and compassion as well as active stand in life and adequate social work, aggression and proneness to conflict are unlikely to develop. On the contrary, lack of support results in excessive alcohol consumption and, thereof, increased proneness to conflict. The system of treatment and rehabilitation measures for survives should involve combination of psychotherapy, psychological correction, and medicines.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome and Anxiety Disorders: A Psychobiological Link",
      "abstract": "The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has been used for many years to describe disturbances of mood or physical symptoms occurring regularly 7–10 days before menses and remitting during menses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III-R) included PMS among the ‘proposed Diagnostic Categories Needing Further Study’ under the name of Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), and established among its diagnostic criteria the need for daily prospective symptoms self-ratings during at least two cycles, for confirmation [1]. The more recent fourth edition of DSM maintained PMS among the categories needing further study, adding the new category of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) [2]. PMDD is distinguished from PMS in several respects: It requires at least one mood symptom; the symptoms must be severe enough to cause functional impairment, and they must not be a mere exacerbation of another psychiatric disorder. Since no other diagnostic criteria have been proposed, many studies have compared the scores from the premenstrual and follicular phases: a 30–50% increase found in prospectively administered diaries is now normally accepted as an indicator of the diagnosis of PMS [3], no attention being paid to the quality of symptoms. On the other hand, no specific hormone changes or other biological markers are able to distinguish between PMS sufferers and normal women [4]. Therefore, the absence of both a universally accepted definition and an objective biological or clinical marker makes it impossible to study the etiology of PMS. Accordingly, the therapeutic approach is presently indefinite. Steinberg [5] correctly stated that the time-honored medical adage maintaining that ‘in the absence of cure, treatments multiply’ seems to be appropriate to PMS. Nevertheless, it is well accepted that the severe form of PMS, i.e. the one characterized by psychosocial impairment and thus requiring medical treatment, is present in 5–8% of women during their 40s. This implies that we should multiply our efforts toward the understanding of the disorder.",

      "title": "Duloxetine in the Treatment of Depression: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disorder that can be classified in the categories of non-organic psychiatric disorders and mood disorders. Mood tone is an important psychic function involved in the adaptation to both our internal and external world. It is flexible, that is, it goes up when we are in positive and favorable conditions, but it goes down when we are in negative and unpleasant states. We can define depression as a condition when mood tone loses its flexibility, it goes down and its no longer influenced by favorable external events. In fact, depression is characterized by changes in the way how the affected individual thinks, feels and acts. Even if this change occurs gradually, a depressed subject is not the same as before. For example, a brilliant student could be persuaded to be not able to finish his studies; an affectionate mother could start to neglect her sons; an enterprising worker could lose every interest for his activity. Moreover, a depressed person doesnt care of his aspect or of himself. The surviving instinct could leave place to the desire to stop his own life. The most evident characteristic of depression in the adulthood is a sad mood, a gloomy solitary and apathetic attitude. A depressed subject could cry also with no apparent reason, he could have difficulty falling asleep or he could wake up very early in the morning and no longer returns to sleep. Or, instead, he could sleep more than usually and he could feel tired persistently. He could lose appetite and weight, or, in some cases, he could eat much more than usually and he could gain weight. Typically, a depressed person feels himself in a extremely negative way, he could think to be hopeless and helpless and he often condemns himself for small guilty. A depressed subject is pessimistic about himself and his own future; he loses interest in all what happens around him and he gets no satisfaction from the activities that before were pleasant. Some persons can be depressed also if they dont show evident signs of depression, but they complain for physical symptoms or they abuse of alcohol or other substances. It has been estimated that in the industrialized Western world one to six persons has a depressive episode at least once during his life; at present, the incidence of depression in the general population is around 5% with clear cut prevalence in the female sex. This leads to high social costs: behind the short-term inability, we have to consider also the long term inability (it has been estimated that, in 2020, depression will represent the second most frequent cause of permanent inability) as well as the suicide risk, the proved major susceptibility of depressed subjects to various non-psychiatric pathologies and the increased rate of premature deaths of depressed individuals as compared to the general population. The present work not only evaluates the drugs used for the treatment of depression, but it focuses also on those studies that investigated the efficacy of a second generation drug: Duloxetine that has a higher selectivity of action and a better tolerability profile as compared to first generation medications. These characteristics make Duloxetine the most effective therapeutic choice to improve both psychological and somatic symptoms of depression in order to get higher rates of symptomatic remission on depressive episodes.

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

Die Symptome einer PTBS werden wie folgt definiert: A. Die Betroffenen sind einem Ereignis oder Geschehen von aussergewoehnlichen Bedrohungen ausgesetzt, das nahezu bei jedem tiefgreifende Verzweiflung ausloesen wuerde. B. Erinnerungen halten an (zum Beispiel sich wiederholende Traeume). C. Der Belastung aehnelnde Umstaende werden tatsaechlich oder moeglichst vermieden. D. Entweder werden wichtige Aspekte der Belastung nicht erinnert, oder es treten anhaltende Symptome auf mit zum Beispiel folgenden Merkmalen: Ein- und Durchschlafstoerungen, Reizbarkeit, Konzentrationsschwierigkeiten, erhoehte Schreckhaftigkeit. E. Die Kriterien B, C und D treten innerhalb von 6 Monaten nach dem Belastungsereignis oder nach Ende einer Belastungsperiode auf. Da Unfallbeteiligte ihre Extremerlebnisse oft nicht aus eigener Kraft loesen koennen, bietet sich die Einrichtung von Anlaufstellen an, in denen Personen und Informationen verfuegbar sind, mit deren Hilfe die organisatorische und psychische Bewaeltigung von Unfallfolgen besser als bisher erfolgen kann. Seit den 80er Jahren wurde psychologische Unfallnachsorge entwickelt und seit Beginn der 90er Jahre praktisch durchgefuehrt.

We report three cases of adolescents who were admitted to general paediatrics services for abdominal pain and/or nausea and vomiting with a negative medical workup. In each case, a clear psychosocial stressor was evident. It is possible that somatic symptoms without clear medical causes may reflect psychosocial stress, but it is difficult to discern whether the psychosocial issues preceded the somatic complaints or were a result of them. Making an accurate diagnosis is difficult, and broaching such a subject with patients and their families is a delicate matter. More research is needed to determine appropriate screening tools for identifying cases where psychosocial stress may play a relevant role in symptom presentation, as well as potential treatment modalities for such cases.",

The core feature of the disorder is chronic, severe, and persistent irritability that manifests as frequent temper outbursts that are inconsistent with the patient’s developmental level. The temper outbursts can be verbal or behavioral including physical aggression or property destruction. Between outbursts, the child remains persistently irritable or angry for most of the day, nearly every day. These symptoms persist across time and settings and are easily observable by others. Psychotherapeutic interventions including parent training and individual psychotherapy are critical components of a comprehensive treatment plan. Since DMDD is a new diagnosis, there are no published randomized controlled medication trials. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or second-generation antipsychotics may be considered for decreasing irritability.",

      "title": "Affective symptoms and emerging psychotic disorder in adolescents",
      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are frequently reported during the period preceding the onset of schizophrenia in adolescents when such symptoms can be mistaken for those of mood disorder. However, it is unclear which emotional symptoms should be considered predictive of schizophrenia onset. The types of emotional disturbances that may precede schizophrenic disorder were sought through a review of historical descriptive studies and seminal works using a phenomenological approach. Five main types of emotional disturbances have been found as prodromal symptoms of a schizophrenic disorder: (1) increased sensitivity to stress, (2) poor or incomplete expression of emotions, (3) reduced emotion sharing, (4) emotional detachment, and (5) disconnection between the perception and expression of emotions. Studies based on phenomenological views of schizophrenic disorders stressed the chronological sequence of these symptoms in the same person. For example, the term “delusional mood” (Wahnstimmung) coined to describe changes in the perceived atmosphere encompass mood disturbances from subtle emotional overreactivity to more severe symptoms that could evoke athymhormia. Analysis of recent studies among subjects at high-risk for psychotic transition showed that the presence of mood symptoms at a very early stage of the disorder is common. While these symptoms predict a lower level of general functioning, they were not associated with a higher risk of developing a schizophrenic disorder at follow-up.

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

The mourning model is not sufficient to account for the type of difficulties, the particular mood and the lowered self-esteem so characteristic of depressive syndromes. The study of the psychological development of children helps us to sort out those situations which are of depressive type. However, not a single past incident during childhood can be clearly singled out as a causal factor of adult depression. Depressed adults as well as neurotics, psychotics, psychopaths or alcoholics have in common the fact that they have experienced early separation more often than control subjects. The attempts to isolate a particular aspect of the premorbid personality of depressed individuals are not at all conclusive. The notion of the typus-melancholicus (Tellenbach) has, however, the value of emphasizing the limiting character of these personalities: the need for a restricted perimeter of activity, limitations as concerns daily goals and painful sensitivity to change. The psychological reconstruction of depression can be done only after the event.",

      "abstract": "The problem of classifying mood disorders still lacks an acceptable solution. Interrater reliability studies have shown that this problem is more prevalent in mood disorders compared with other psychiatric conditions. Historically the problem originates from the distinction between Geisteskrankheiten and Gemütskrankheiten (mental and mood disorders) because the domain covered by the word mood has been progressively reduced. The fact that neurotic disorders are \"emotional disorders\" further complicates this field. The words anxiety and depression refer to a disorder, to a symptom, and to everyday feelings. A failure or difficulty in the distinction between these three meanings leads to nosological confusion. In recent years, the notion of a spectrum of mood disorders has gained acceptance. According to this, the diverse disorders are placed on a point that is more or less close to one of the extremes. Something similar occurs in the unipolar-bipolar distinction, in which the bipolar II or atypical and bipolar III occupy a central place on the spectrum. Cluster analysis and other mathematical techniques have helped to clarify the outlook, but there is a need for a biopsychosocial perspective and for a deeper understanding of the natural history of these disorders.",

However, it can considerably reduce motivation to the treatment, overcoming the illness, increase the risk of suicidal behavior and in general worsen the quality of their life. Manifestations of the depressed mood of cancer patients are similar to manifestations of the depressed mood of the patients having chronic or deadly diseases. However, there are features which depend on some factors, the most important of which is the disease stage. The results obtained allow to draw a conclusion that the features of the depressed mood at the second stage of the disease are connected with acceptation of the diagnosis and can manifest in the feeling of a punishment expectation, loss of interests in previous hobbies and communication restrictions; the features of a depressed mood at the third stage are determined by the disease dynamics and the further forecast, and can manifest in the analysis of the previous mistakes, absence of of hopes for the future, disgust for themselves and feeling of uselessness.",

      "abstract": "The author fundamentally questions the traditional concept of the disease-entity (or several disease entities) of 'schizophrenia' and discusses an alternative concept, based on vulnerability and information-processing. According to this, schizophrenia-like psychotic phenomena develop in three phases. In the first, premorbid phase, combined biological (genetic and possibly other organic) and psycho-social influences lead to a premorbid 'vulnerability', characterised by a low tolerance of cognitive and emotional stress, corresponding to an insufficient capacity for the adequate processing of complex information. In the second phase, stressful life-events can lead to unique or repeated acute productive psychotic episodes. The third phase, that of long-term evolution, depends more on psycho-social influences than on biological factors. Under unfavourable conditions, it may lead to predominantly unproductive residual states of various degrees, which can largely be understood as regulatory mechanisms to restrict stressful over-stimulation. There is no clearly delimitable disease entity of schizophrenia with constant causes, psychopathological picture, or course, but rather a multi-conditioned life-process, occurring in people with a particular vulnerability, interacting with complex life-events and circumstances. This new concept has important consequences for therapy and prevention.",

Headache is defined as pain occurring only or mainly above the orbitomeatal and/or nuchal ridge, whereas facial pain is defined as pain occurring mainly or exclusively under the orbitomeatal line, anterior to the pinnae and above the neck.

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

      "abstract": "Acute and chronic stress-related mechanisms play an important role in the development of addiction and its chronic, relapsing nature. Multisystem adaptations in brain, body, behavioral, and social function may contribute to a dysregulated physiological state that is maintained beyond the homeostatic range. In addition, chronic abuse of substances leads to an altered set point across multiple systems. Resilience can be defined as the absence of psychopathology despite exposure to high stress and reflects a person's ability to cope successfully in the face of adversity, demonstrating adaptive psychological and physiological stress responses. The study of resilience can be approached by examining interindividual stress responsibility at multiple phenotypic levels, ranging from psychological differences in the way people cope with stress to differences in neurochemical or neural circuitry function. The ultimate goal of such research is the development of strategies and interventions to enhance resilience and coping in the face of stress and prevent the onset of addiction problems or relapse.",

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

This question has arisen repeatedly over the years, in part because of the apparent correspondence between the illnesses of depression and mania on the one hand, and the emotions of sadness and elation on the other. The latter, as transient mood states, can be triggered by events. If the illness depression is viewed as a kind of supersadness or the illness mania as superelation, then by extension one might assume that those discrete disorders can also be triggered by events. Making this assumption, physicians and patients alike often seek a causal connection between stressful events and sustained affective disorder. In an individual case it is impossible to prove or",

The DSM-IV also excludes confounding disorders and requires confirmation of the diagnosis after 2 months of prospective daily ratings. These strict criteria reinforce the fact that not all women who have premenstrual symptoms have a mental illness. These criteria also allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is primarily reserved for milder physical and emotional symptoms.5 These criteria allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual magnification (PMM), which occurs when symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder are magnified during the premenstruum.6",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal.

      "abstract": "Depression is more common in old age than dementia yet is underdiagnosed and undertreated. It is important to recognise that patients may not always present in a typical way, features that may indicate depression include anxiety, a preoccupation with somatic symptoms, and a change in function. The presence of understandable triggers and causes should not deter GPs from offering treatment, as long as symptoms are pervasive and continuously persist beyond two weeks. Age-related disabilities and changes to physical health are major risk factors for depression in older people. Vascular diseases, including stroke, MI and diabetes increase the risk of depression, both through direct effects on the brain and the psychological effects. Likewise, dementia is a risk factor for depression. Psychological factors such as loneliness and loss of a valued role, as well as social factors related to retirement, bereavement and reduced independence may also increase the risk. Patients with a previous history of depression and anxiety disorders are at increased risk of depression in later life. Assessment and diagnosis are largely based on a careful history. This should focus on eliciting current features of depression, which have been present for at least two weeks, and are associated with a significant change in function. It is important to exclude organic disorders including anaemia, B12 and folate deficiency, and hypothyroidism that may mimic symptoms of depressive disorder. Referral to specialist mental health services is indicated in the following cases: diagnostic difficulty, poor response to treatment, psychotic symptoms, significant psychiatric comorbidity or a risk of self-neglect or suicide.",

In addition, the methodologic criteria of the literature search excluded some well-known reports about this subject.Because of the small number of studies, there was inadequate evidence that chronic pain results from a prior psychiatric disorder (level 4a). The studies provided limited evidence (level 3) that chronic depression plays a role in the development of new pain locations (although not for low back pain); that prior nervousness and past negative life events predict work disability; and that depression, anxiety, and a sense that control rests outside of one's own self may predict slower recovery from pain and disability.

Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "abstract": "The term „burnout” does not denote a psychiatric category, but a psychological label for the experience of a long-lasting exhaustion and loss of interest. Burnout is not an explicitly recognized disorder in prominent classifications of diseases. It is rather a state of emotional exhaustion and reduced sense of personal accomplishment than a syndrome or a disease. It can be assessed, e.g., by The Maslach Burnout Inventory which uses a three dimensional description of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. Some authors argue for an “exhaustion only” model that sees exhaustion as the hallmark of „burnout“. Engagement, which is characterized by energy and efficacy, may be regarded as the opposite to burnout, which is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy. On the other hand, this condition is described in the ICD-10 as “Problems related to lifemanagement difficulty” (Z73, i.e., not among mental disorders but among Factors influencing health status and contact with health services, Z00-99). As this condition is also described in DSM-IV as “adjustment disorder”, the concept of „burnout” seems to be redundant and useful only out of medicine as a journalistic label for a reaction which can be classified otherwise.",

      "abstract": "Without antidepressant therapy, episodes of clinical depression last from 2 months to several years, with an average of around 5 to 6 months. One-third of the patients recover within a year; probably one out of four untreated episodes may last more than 2 years. Depressive episodes occur, on the average, every 2 to 3 years. ECT and antidepressant drug therapy greatly reduce the duration of episodes and significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality of affective disorders. With modern treatment, during a 5-year follow-up, about one quarter of depressed patients had no recurrent episodes, more than half recovered in less than 2 or 3 months, and about one in seven patients developed chronic depression (episodes lasting longer than 2 years). Suicide attempts were made by one fifth of this group of patients, and 6% committed suicide. However, three-fourths of the patients were well three-fourths of the time. Age and culture seem to influence the course of depression. In addition to the classified clinical depressions, there is a considerable prevalence in the general population of depressive symptomatology and dysphoric states, apparently related to genetic factors, age, and stress. Little is known about the course and indications for treatment of these latter conditions, which should be the target for more systematic study and research in the ever widening fields of the phenomenology and therapy of depression.",

Symptoms of depression are at least seen from three aspects, namely physical symptoms, psychic symptoms, and social symptoms. Some people have a negative stigma about individuals affected by mental disorders such as depression, some studies show data on affected individuals exposed to negative stigma, one of which was shown by McLean Hospital in 2020 which showed that 75% of individuals with mental disorders had been stigmatized by society. The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders.

      "title": "Psychiatric conditions",
      "abstract": "In reviewing psychiatric syndromes, some themes recur. This does not lead to a general theory of disorder, but to an analysis that has some general features. Set against a developmental background, disorder is viewed in relation to the tasks that must be achieved where multiple sets of mental rules are possible. These include the monitoring of internal and interpersonal rules, the maintenance of the individual's experience of continuity in the presence of multiple states of mind, and the capacity to understand the mental states and actions of others. Many of the overarching, metarepresentational functions could also be characterized as functions of the self, and these appear to be disrupted in conditions that are as widely different as schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. In schizophrenia the monitoring of the individual's own thoughts or actions may be impaired, whilst in borderline functioning the continuity of states of mind is undermined. If the sense of self is derived from the awareness of being the author of one's own actions or thoughts over time, then in these conditions it is undermined in different ways. Inasmuch as the coherence of the self is in turn central to action, disturbances of action are the result of these different forms of disruption of the self.In both condition, further contrasting factors may undermine action. In schizophrenia inefficient information processing may lead either to action based on incidental aspects of a situation, or to inaction based on information overload. In borderline personality disorder experiences in which action has been impossible may lead to action turned on itself, in self injury. However, in both, there may be elements that represent the attempt to preserve action in the face of such threats. In schizophrenia delusions and hallucinations may in part be compensatory mechanisms that reduce uncertainty, hence providing the basis for action. In borderline personality disorder the splitting of mental representations may similarly, by excluding elements that are incompatible with action, provide (partial) representations that provide the basis for action. Thus in both conditions elements of accurate representation are sacrificed, in order for action to continue.Conditions in which action is preserved may be contrasted with those, such as depression, where it is not. In either case a range of intentional and non-intentional origins may be envisaged. In situations of helplessness depression may be seen to be an appropriate and accurate representation that action is not possible. Depression seen in the absence of such threat may result from the intrusion of cognitive and emotional states that undermine action arising from a physical, non-intentional interruption of perceptions, thoughts, feelings, or actions. Equally depression may arise where mental representations that have been maintained inactive or out of consciousness are activated, and are incompatible with action.We conclude by revisiting our starting point. Mental entities, perceptions, feelings, thoughts, and wishes are genuinely causal and must provide sufficient certainty that the individual can act effectively. Throughout biology, intentional states of organisms, from the simplest cellular creatures to non-human primates, have provided the basis for action, and in general the certainty has been derived from the evolution of those intentional states over long periods of time. In this and the preceding chapters we have seen how, in the activities of the human mind there is an infinite elaboration of the potential inherent in all intentional processes in biology. This has introduced novelty, creativity, and flexibility, that are seen in the achievements of language, custom, technology, and culture. It has also increased the risks of uncertainty, confusion, and the undermining of action. These are reduced through an interplay between the sophisticated integrative capacities of the human brain and the continuities of human relationships, skills, beliefs, and social organizations. Disorder is found in the failure of intentional states to underpin action, where these are undermined by the external world, or where intentional states are distorted, contradictory or unintegrated, and where action is undermined or ineffective.",

      "title": "A Review of Mental Health: Epidemiology, Interventions, and Treatment Modalities",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Psychiatric problems are widespread globally, with depression ranking as the third most prevalent factor. By 2030, it is forecasted to become the leading factor contributing to the occurrence of diseases. The state of one's mental health has a substantial influence on their sense of value, relationships with others, and day-to-day functioning. Signs and symptoms of mental health issues can include enduring feelings of sadness, disruptions in sleep patterns, reduced energy levels, alterations in appetite, changes in behaviour and thoughts, difficulties with concentration, substance abuse, detachment from reality, managing daily stress, problems in relationships, deterioration in personal care, and a noticeable decline in performance at school, work, or social activities. These symptoms may result in social isolation, emotional eruptions, intense rage, suicidal ideation, impaired focus, and challenges in interpersonal interactions. Having an optimal state of mental health can significantly improve the overall quality of life, whilst having a substandard state of well-being can worsen it. There is a strong association between poor mental health and a range of diseases, such as chronic inflammation, cardiovascular dysfunction, asthma, metabolic disorders, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune syndromes, and neurological diseases. Various elements, including biological, psychological, behavioural, dietary, and social factors, might exert an influence on mental health. The government implements actions and projects to improve global mental health, and there are multiple ways available for assessing mental health. Medicinal therapies such as Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and Unani can be utilized to enhance mental health. The extent to which psychological therapy can improve mental health is still a mystery to us. A thorough literature review was conducted using various databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus) and government websites, focusing on mental health, including epidemiology, interventions, and treatment methods. Additionally, the potential impacts of climate change on mental health were examined. This study aimed to address the limitations of previous reviews by evaluating the effectiveness of various psychological interventions, regardless of their theoretical foundation, and assessing the influence of different moderators in a single systematic review and meta-analysis. While further research is needed, the review offers insights into the design of psychological interventions to enhance mental well-being.",

      "title": "Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder comparative",
      "abstract": "Stress is the answer of organism to expo­sure to stress factors and is the cause of various psychopathological manifestations. Psychopathological consequences that are timely and directly related to stress are acute stress disorder (ASD) and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Severity of the traumatic event, as a predictive factor for ASD and PTSD, is more important than the number of events. Prevalence of PTSP varires depending on a study, starting from 1% after various trauma while after combat experience it can be up to 36%. There are six groups of symptoms present in ASD or PTSD: dissociative, intrusive, avoiding, anxiety and hiperexcitability, disfuncionallity and compulsory reexposure to trauma. The main difference in ASD diagnostic criteria between ICD-10 and DSM-IV classifications is the fact that DSM-IV insists in dissociative symptoms. According DSM-IV, ASD symptoms last for a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 4 weeks. These criteria differ from ICD-10 criteria which require only 8 hours of duration of the symptoms. There is no important difference between the classifications in diagnostic criteria for PTSD. ASD and PTSD are two time dependent diagnostic categories and they are closely connected regarding to their clinical features. Duration of the symptoms less than 1 month or more is the point where ASD finishes and when PTSD starts. Dissociative symptoms are present in ASD and diminish with time, and they are absent in PTSD. Treatment of ASD is based on psychotherapeutical intervention (ventilation or abreaction). The most important principles in the treatment of ASD are brevity, immediacy, proximity, superficiality and return to full functioning. Therapy of PTSD as well as therapy of ASD includes psychotherapeutical techniques (support, explanation and destigmatization). Pharmacotherapy is used in according to actual psychopathology.",

      "title": "Mood and affect",
      "abstract": "Readers are grateful to Macpherson and Hikida1 for helping us understand the role of the basal ganglia in various mental disorders. In listing the symptoms of major depressive disorder, they mention, ‘low mood (also known as “flat affect”).’ This is a common mistake. Low mood refers to the feeling/internal emotional state of the individual – it is a symptom. It is a subjective matter and if the individual states that his/her mood is low, we are obliged to accept that assessment (we might, of course, comment that the signs are or are not consistent with the statement). The term ‘affect,’ when used in the assessment of the mental state, refers to the external manifestations of an internal feeling state – here, affect is a sign. (The term ‘affect’ is also sometimes used as an alternative to ‘mood,’ as is ‘affective disorders,’ but this is archaic and not much used currently.) The term ‘flat affect’ was coined to describe a sign of chronic schizophrenia. This largely refers to the unvarying immobile face and slow-moving body often associated with a loss (or absence) of emotional experience/life. It is a negative symptom. But ‘flat’ here is not interchangeable with ‘low’ – the important additional aspect is that the external manifestation does not vary. Where there is flat affect it is usually difficult to get an emotional response (reciprocal emotional response) from the patient. The face and behavior of the individual with a low mood may be similar, at times, to that of the person with schizophrenia with negative symptoms. However, the underlying processes are different. In one there is low mood, in the other there is absence of emotion. The external features (affect) associated with low mood revert to normal when the mood disorder resolves. The flat affect of schizophrenia changes little in response to treatment. Low mood and flat affect are distinct entities – ‘mood’ refers to subjective experience and ‘affect’ refers to objective evidence. Low mood is not always accompanied by psychomotor retardation (which limits facial and bodily movement) and the flat affect of schizophrenia may not be accompanied by low mood. The author has no conflicts of interest to declare.",

A variety of psychological factors have been reported to be either predisposing or precipitating causes of migraine. Among the predisposing factors have been various personality attributes; neurosis and other psychiatric disorders. Among the precipitating factors are emotional reactions, changes in life situation; various psychosocial stresses, periods of overactivity and 'let down' periods. In addition to the operation of the above psychological factors, which constitute a psychosomatic sequence of events, there are also mood changes which may accompany an attack of migraine associated with alterations in energy, concentration, and ability to work. There may also be a somatopsychic sequence of events in which the sufferer may react in various ways to an attack of migraine just as he may react to any other illness or disability.",

A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

      "title": "Stressful headache already among young adults?",
      "abstract": "Stress is defined as an organism’s total response to environmental demands or pressures. The impact of stress on the body was explored by Hans Selye in 1936 (1). He first defined a ‘‘general adaptation syndrome,’’ which revolves around the concept of homeostasis. According to the concept of homeostasis, in response to stressors the body seeks to return to its equilibrium state, or a normal level of stress resistance. The general adaptation syndrome is composed of an initial alarm phase, followed by a period of sustained resistance, and ending with exhaustion. During the initial alarm phase, the body begins to build up resistance to the stressor beyond normal resistance levels and mobilizes the sympathetic nervous system to meet the immediate threat. In the resistance phase, the individual’s body attempts to resist or cope with a persistent stressor that cannot be avoided. This phase also results in an increase in level of hormones like cortisol, which has been found to be elevated during stressful situations (2). Finally, the body enters the exhaustion phase which can threaten the person’s well-being and lead to psychological or physical health consequences. The causes of stress are a mix of personal, interpersonal, and social factors and can include any event or occurrence that a person considers a threat to his or her coping strategies or resources. For example, lack or loss of control over one’s physical environment or social support network can cause stress. In addition, some vulnerability to stress could be caused by genetic markers (3). The symptoms of stress can be either physical or psychological. Stress-related physical illnesses, such as heart attacks, arthritis, and chronic pain conditions, result from long-term overstimulation of a part of the sympatric nervous system that regulates the heart rate, blood pressure, and digestive system (4). Moreover, chronic stress increases the risk of developing depression and anxiety (5). Stress and headache are intricately interrelated and there are several questions concerning the etiology of stress and headache. On one side, stress could act as a trigger for headache or migraine attacks and modify or exacerbate headache intensity and duration. This also includes the immediate time after reduction of stress (‘‘let-down headache’’) (6). Stress and stressful life events may also increase headache/migraine attack frequency, eventually resulting in chronic headache forms (7,8). On the other side, headache and migraine attacks themselves could act as factors leading to increased stress levels. In this issue of Cephalalgia, Schramm and colleagues evaluate the association between headache and stress in a longitudinal population-based study (9). The data are from a large general population-based study from Germany that includes a broad age range (21–71 years old). This longitudinal study quantitatively shows that the frequency of stressful events is positively and significantly correlated with the frequency of headaches. Furthermore, this association is particularly pronounced in participants with tension-type headache and among younger headache sufferers. The results of the study strongly underscore the importance of the stress-headache association on the population level and highlight that this association starts early in life. All analyses between perceived stress and the headache forms are adjusted for sex, age, frequent intake of acute pain medications, alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, and education. These data highlight the importance of evaluating young adults for the presence of this association and call for the development of interventions specifically tailored to this population. In their discussion, the authors suggest the use of mind/body treatments, such as meditation, yoga, or tai chi, and behavioral treatments such as stress management, coping skills, biofeedback, and relaxation training. However, there are little data regarding the effect of various interventions on the stress-headache",

These may include organic aggressive, or organic affective syndromes that are episodic in nature and therefore require a more specific diagnosis, a different classification, and a different approach to treatment. Consequently, it is necessary for clinicians to learn to distinguish between \"primary\" psychiatric illnesses and those disorders of behavioural control and mood that stem specifically from brain injury. There is relatively little in the clinical literature that explains the relationship between variable states of behaviour, mood or temperament, and clinical disorders that may have long-term implications for patient management. This concept paper therefore addresses abnormalities of mood and behaviour that are episodic in character and are not recognisably included in the DSM and ICD classifications of psychological or psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder of high prevalence and major socioeconomic impact. Patients suffering from PTSD typically present intrusion and avoidance symptoms and alterations in arousal, mood and cognition that last for more than 1 month. Animal models are an indispensable tool to investigate underlying pathophysiological pathways and, in particular, the complex interplay of neuroendocrine, genetic and environmental factors that may be responsible for PTSD induction. Since the 1960s, numerous stress paradigms in rodents have been developed, based largely on Seligman's seminal formulation of ‘learned helplessness’ in canines. Rodent stress models make use of physiological or psychological stressors such as foot shock, underwater trauma, social defeat, early life stress or predator‐based stress. Apart from the brief exposure to an acute stressor, chronic stress models combining a succession of different stressors for a period of several weeks have also been developed. Chronic stress models in rats and mice may elicit characteristic PTSD‐like symptoms alongside, more broadly, depressive‐like behaviours. In this review, the major existing rodent models of PTSD are reviewed in terms of validity, advantages and limitations; moreover, significant results and implications for future research—such as the role of FKBP5, a mediator of the glucocorticoid stress response and promising target for therapeutic interventions—are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a natural reaction to stress, but in some individuals it can develop into a psychopathological condition that persists even after the stress has been resolved. The number of and amount of difficulty associated with stressful life events can be a significant predictor for the development of depression or anxiety-related disorders. Individuals suffering from anxiety disorders are more likely to report exposure to stressful events than nonanxious individuals. These relationships are even stronger when anxiety and major depression are comorbid within individuals. In addition, anxiety and depression are prominent in many patients with pain disorders. The presence of pain can be seen not only as a possible marker for anxiety, but also as a causative factor. In either of these cases, the presence of persistent painful symptoms should be a strong indication to clinicians that an anxiety disorder may develop or may already be present, and that treatment is needed for both the pain symptoms and the comorbid anxiety. With daily life becoming increasingly more stressful, the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety spectrum disorders become more important. Treating these disorders early can prevent generalized anxiety from developing into more disabling disorders. This monograph reviews the relationship between stressful life events and anxiety as well as comorbidity of pain and anxiety, and examines the somatic symptoms, such as muscle aches, chest pain, and headaches, often associated with anxiety disorders. Available treatments that may be efficacious in the treatment of individuals experiencing comorbid anxiety and pain are discussed as well.",

The mechanism of causation of this disorder has been poorly understood, though biological, psychological and social factors seem to play a role. The disorder causes significant impairment and is highly comorbid with other disorders.

Comorbid anxious features often complicate the recognition of depression and may herald a poor prognosis. We report the results of a cross-sectional naturalistic study to determine the impact of three interventions (no antidepressant, fluoxetine, or tricyclic antidepressant therapy) on relative risk of work days lost in 454 French outpatients with either major or minor depression. Most depressed patients also manifested anxious features (76% with a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score ≥ 12). The presence of anxiety was related to the severity of depression, work absenteeism, and current social instability. Depression severity (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ≤ 26, including the contributions of anxious symptoms), psychiatric comorbidity, and psychomotor retardation best predicted continued work absenteeism. Patients with major depression were more likely to receive an antidepressant if they had a past history of depressive episodes and/or previous work disability. Patients with minor depression were less likely to receive drug therapy than patients with major depression, despite their current work disability. Among patients who received fluoxetine or a tricyclic antidepressant for at least 8 weeks, fluoxetine was associated with statistically significantly lower mean anxiety and depression scores and fewer work days missed.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY We have carried out this research because accidents are a serious public health problem in Mexico. They are the third overall mortality cause and the first among young adults. In addition, in our country, the study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not been focused sufficiently on accidents, not to speak of motor vehicles accidents. Among the different types of accidents, traffic accidents are placed at the top of the list. Aside from causing injuries and the loss of man hours at work, these accidents bring about emotional distress to affected individuals. Stress is a factor that triggers short-and medium-term consequences which are in turn reflected in the quality of life of the patient and his/her family. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that causes psychosocial disfunctioning and appears due to the exposure to a stressor or traumatic event. It may come about in two ways: when the subject is a victim of a serious threat to his/her life or integrity and when the subject witnesses an event seriously affecting a third party. The main stressors may be natural phenomena, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, intentional attacks, such as rape or any form of criminal violence, and, as is the case here, from traumatic events caused by motor vehicles. The etiology of PTSD is multi-factorial and involves genetic, psychological, educational, and environmental aspects. It has three forms: severe, where the disorder appears immediately after the occurrence of the event or until a month later; chronic, lasting between one and three months; and delayed, where symptoms appear six months after the event. Our objective was to establish PTSD frequency in patients with physical injuries caused by motor vehicles accidents who were attended at the Regional Orthopaedics and Trauma Hospital “Adolfo Lopez Mateos”. Together with the application of the scales, we were interested in making a description of the sociodemographical side of accidents, comparing the affect profile, and somehow defining the wide range of factors involved in the occurrence of this problem. For this, we devised a transversal and descriptive study with a non-probabilistic sampling. The sample was chosen using the following inclusion criteria: a)Being older than 18 years.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

The sense of body image and body ego are altered in ways that are frightening or confusing to the patient. The subjkective experience of time becomes present-oriented, with time moving slowly. Grief or depression, clinically distinct responses, may further debilitate the individual. Anxiety, guilt and rage are additional emotional responses. Patients use previously existing coping patterns to manage the crisis of sudden disability. It is not the nature or the severity of the injury that exclusively influences the psychological response, but rather, it is the interaction of the person and the total environment that determines behavior.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Several studies have reported a relation between PTSD diagnosis, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The association was initially reported in veterans cohorts and later described also in general population. In particular, in wounded US military servants, the incidence of hypertension was independently associated with the injury severity score and the chronicity of PTSD. More recently, in a series of patients from Bukavu, man-made trauma and PTSD were strongly associated with hypertension, over and above classical environmental and lifestyle factors. PTSD has also been involved in the pathogenesis of resistant hypertension and poor drug adherence, either directly or through mediation of altered expression of emotions and somatization. PTSD should be considered among the mechanisms involved in onset and maintenance of hypertension, particularly in military servants and war veterans, subjects living in countries exposed to war and chronic violence, migrants, refugees and patients with resistant and difficult-to-control hypertension. Further research is required to unravel the mechanisms underlying the association of PTSD and hypertension, and to define the optimal therapeutic strategy and psychological interventions required to improve blood pressure control, psychological well-being and to decrease cardiovascular risk in patient suffering from both conditions.",

The latter are alternative modes of expressing distress and indicate manifestations of distress in relation to personal and cultural meaning. Health professionals often consider these as hysterical, functional or having functional overlays, and abnormal illness behaviors. Management of idioms of distress would need cultural competence and sensitivity. This article highlights the common idioms of distress in India with specific focus on bodily symptoms.",

These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.",

In the modern world any person is subject to the influence of stress, regardless of the age and gender differences, culture and social status. Stress is a non-specific reaction of the body to the extreme impact of various factors - stressors. As stressors can be: emotional, social, physical, informational and other factors. In functional and morphological terms, stress is manifests itself as a general adaptation syndrome which mobilizes the body’s resources in order to maintain homeostasis. Stress is characterized by staging. The early period of stress is manifested by transient anxiety, with a decrease in body resistance – it is the first stage of the adaptation syndrome. The second stage of stress is characterized by the functional tension of the body’s systems and adaptation to new conditions. In the case of prolonged stress, the body’s reaction becomes pathological, with the depletion of adaptive reserves and the failure of protective mechanisms. At this stage is increase a vulnerability to any stressors. There is a further violation of the consistency of vital functions, and persistent anxiety is formed. In overwhelming majority of cases, stress-induced anxiety is develop of psychovegetative syndrome. In the case when combined the strategies of coping (it is the second stage of the reaction to stress - the stage of resistance) with stress and if it is interrupted at an early stage, in such a way the somatic symptoms are also interrupted at the stage of autonomic dystonia syndrome. When the persistent stress is, we have a development of the third stage – exhaustion. And against the background of limited adaptive reactions, there is a psychosomatic pathology. The above determines the need for early detection of psychovegetative syndrome and its timely treatment. The optimal choice is the appointment of combined drugs for stress, which have anti-anxiety, sedative and hypnotic effects. The combination of phenobarbital and ethylbromisovalerinate is one of the highly effective and widely used for the relief of stressinduced anxiety and manifestations of autonomic dysfunction, reducing the risk of developing psychosomatic pathology.",

      "abstract": "In comprehending the nature of posttraumatic reactions, time is a critical dimension in understanding the nature and severity of reactions. The relationship between the acute reaction to the traumatic event and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an issue that is frequently referred to, and many assumptions are presumed. In particular, it is often presumed that those who develop PTSD behave in maladaptive ways at the time of the trauma. Increasingly it appears that there are relatively few differences in the immediate proximity of traumatic events between those who go on to develop PTSD, as opposed to those who do not develop any disorder or develop conditions such as posttraumatic depression. It appears that the disorder emerges in the days and weeks that follow the event, suggesting some abnormality of dampening of reactivity. While PTSD is a valuable construct in describing the long‐term outcomes of trauma, it is important to recognize that there are a range of other psychiatric disorders such as depression, substance abuse and anxiety which can emerge in the aftermath of these experiences. The longer term follow‐up of traumatized populations also increasingly demonstrates the impact on their health and health‐seeking behaviors. The long‐term course of PTSD can best be understood by considering the interaction between a range of biological, psychological and social variables that influence the individual's propensity and predisposition. The nature of the biological stress response at the time of the trauma may be a critical factor that influences the long‐term outcome. As well, the patterns of substance abuse can also modify the longitudinal phenomenology of this disorder. The emergence of findings from longitudinal studies is increasingly indicating that the nature of PTSD at different points in its life history may need to be distinguished. It is possible that treatment interventions that are effective at one point may not be so in the more chronic forms. The progressive psychobiological changes in this condition require greater clarification.",

Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference.

Environmental factors that cause pressure are referred to as stressors. Prolonged exposure to multiple stressors simultaneously can adversely affect a person's mental and physical health, potentially leading to chronic health issues. The negative effects of mental stress on human health have been recognized for decades. High levels of stress should be detected early to prevent these adverse effects. While the stress response helps the body overcome challenges and prepare for threats, prolonged stress can harm health. This paper aims to design a basic, cost-effective, low-power smart band for healthcare that detects mental stress based on skin conductance. This band can continuously monitor the user's mental stress and wirelessly transmit stress-related data to the user's smartphone. It not only helps users better understand their stress levels but also provides physicians with reliable data for improved treatment. The inputs to this tool come from various alerts generated by different sensors.",

In response to accumulating evidence, DSM ‐5 no longer places the same emphasis on dissociative symptoms, and does not require a specific number of any cluster of symptoms for a diagnosis of ASD . Instead, it requires the presence of 9 of any of 14 potential symptoms of ASD , and prohibits the diagnosis until 3 days have elapsed post trauma. Although ASD predicts the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ), relative to trauma‐exposed people who do not develop ASD , most individuals with PTSD do not meet ASD diagnostic criteria prior to the diagnosis of PTSD .

The appropriate use of evidence-based practices, administered as soon as possible after return from deployment, may offer the best hope for alleviating PTSD and preventing subsequent occupational, social, and familial impairments. A number of etiological pathways and causal mechanisms have been implicated in the development of PTSD. PTSD is a severe psychiatric disorder resulting from a history of exposure to a traumatic event that results in a minimum threshold of symptoms across four symptom clusters namely: intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. Additional criteria relate to duration of symptoms, functioning, and differential diagnosis due to a substance or other co-occurring condition.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships.

      "title": "Somatization",
      "abstract": "Abstract Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are particularly common presentations in primary care settings. They lie on a severity spectrum, with significant overlaps with other functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses like depression and anxiety, and general medical conditions. Typically, symptoms present with either no identifiable medical aetiology, or are disproportionate to the cause, with associated distress and preoccupations, health-related anxiety, and help-seeking behaviours. Cultural factors are known to shape shared mental representations about interpreting such symptom experiences and are therefore vital determinants of health and illness reporting. The nosology of MUS has been debated, deliberated, and transformed several times over the last century. Several models have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of MUS based on the complex interaction of developmental, personality, cognitive–perceptual, cultural, and emotional processes within a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Effective and sensitive communication of socio-culturally grounded and individualized illness formulations that link the individual’s belief systems, diagnosis, and treatment options are key to managing MUS. Medications are used to treat severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Psychotherapy that targets coping, help-seeking behaviours, and real-world functioning is also effective.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

Manifestation of the disease depends on the stressors specific action, individuals internal factors (age, gender, breed, genetic inheritance) and external factors (nutrition, housing conditions, ect.). There are two types of stress, positive (eustress) and negative stress (distress). The stress response is a useful physiological response to stress and consists of three phases: alarm reaction, resistance phase and exhaustion phase. It is a combination of behavioral responses, responses of the autonomic nervous system, neuroendocrine and immune response. The result of stress response can be return to homeostasis or development of pathological conditions. Adrenal hormones and the sympathetic nervous system regulate stress response. Stress can suppress, potentiate or not have any effect on the immune system depending on the type of stressor (psychic, physical, etc.), on the genetic properties of the individual, age, social hierarchy and whether the effects are acute or chronic. If stress is prolonged, the immune system is suppressed through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland axis. The influence of the genetic heritage as the intrinsic factor is used to reduce the sensitivity of animals to stress which consequently, results in faster growth, better reproductive capability and a reduced incidence of diseases",

      "title": "Minor Depression and 'Subthreshold' Anxiety Symptoms in Older Adults: Psychosocial Therapies and Special Considerations",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS A new focus on these common causes of distress and impairment. In recent years more attention has been given to identifying and treating mental disorders in older adults. By and large, these efforts have focused on disorders delineated in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Sta/Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). However, another class of disorders is also beginning to receive attention: mental disorders. Although these sets of symptoms do not meet the full criteria to be classified as specific mental disorders, they are nonetheless associated with clinically significant distress or impairment (Pincus, Davis, and McQueen,1999). In this article we will discuss two specific conditions, and subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder, and the evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial therapies for these conditions for older adults. MINOR DEPRESSION Minor depression is typically defined as the presence of at least two but fewer than five depressive symptoms, including depressed mood or loss of interest in normal daily activities, during the same two-week period with no history of major depressive episode or dysthymic disorder but with clinically significant impairment or distress (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Minor depression is highly prevalent in older adults in the community (9.9 percent) (Hybels, Blazer, and Pieper, 2001) and in primary care (5.2 percent) (Lyness et al., 1999). In mixed-age samples minor depression has been shown to be associated with levels of functional impairment comparable to those caused by medical illnesses (Wells et al., 1992) and with increased expenditures on medical care (Johnson, Weissman, and Klerman, 1992). Morbidity has been less extensively studied in samples of older adults, but the morbidity rates of elders with minor depression may be assumed to be at least comparable to samples with medical illnesses given the higher prevalence of complicating medical conditions. A recent study has shown minor depression to be associated with an increased risk for mortality in older men (Penninx et al., 1999). Although assessment of the prevalence of minor depression in racial and ethnic minority populations tends to be clouded by linguistic and cultural differences in expressing affective and somatic symptoms, recent research taking into account these measurement challenges indicates that minor depression is very common in older ethnic minorities in primary care. According to Arean and Alvidrez (2001), as many as io percent of older African Americans, 15 percent of older Latinos, and 12 percent of older Asians meet criteria for minor depression. SCREENING FOR MINOR DEPRESSION One of the most common instruments for screening and tracking depression in primary care is the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-- Item Depression Module (PHQ-9). The patient fills out the questionnaire, and the information can yield a diagnosis of major or minor depression. While psychometric studies have yet to be done on the utility of the PHQ-9 with minority elders, the instrument is available in Spanish and Chinese. PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPIES FOR MINOR DEPRESSION Empirically derived treatment guidelines have been established for major depression. However, a paucity of studies, which have yielded conflicting findings, means that no specific guidelines are currently available for pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment of minor depression. Psychosocial therapies are particularly appealing for older adults because they often have medical conditions as well, leading to an increased possibility of adverse drug interactions. Since the research on treating minor depression in older adults is so limited, we will review the evidence for psychosocial treatments of minor depression in both younger and older adults together. The interventions examined include cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and problem-solving therapy, as well as physical exercise. …",

Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

      "abstract": "This disorder affects approximately 15% to 20% of people who have experienced traumatic events.So to say, it is a predominant disease that is worthy of importance.Posttraumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder determined by a series of physical, mental and emotional evidence that can appear up to 6 months after a traumatic event or experience in the patient's life.It usually consists of repeated and irrepressible memories of occurrences for at least 1 month.Tiny or even trivial stimuli can awaken memories that resurface with all the intensity and clarity of the originating event.This memory is usually triggered by stimuli associated with traumatic episode, starting from the most typical to the most common.Therefore, even a considerably safe environment can become dangerous because people can never be sure that they will not feel any stimulus that will cause the unpleasant emotional experience.Symptoms associated with recurrences of trauma are linked to notable restlessness, concussions, and most victims try to avoid this pain and stay away from any stimulus that may provoke the traumatic memory cycle.In this context, in this research, the data were collected from a bibliographic survey of several authors in many databases.",

Here, we shall refer to conditions with long-lasting and disabling symptoms, not trivial or passing symptoms. Such conditions are called medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Syndromes with specific diagnostic criteria, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome, are often included among MUS conditions.2\n\nAlthough management of patients with MUS presents several challenges, GPs accept the responsibility for investigation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.5\n\nBiopsychosocial approaches are commonly applied in medical practice, whether the aim is full recovery or coping with symptoms and disability,1 and psychologically based interventions (especially different cognitive behavioural therapies [CBT]) have been developed for coping and symptom relief. Yet, such approaches do not substantiate MUS as a mental disorder. Lamahewa et al found, for example, that comorbidity with depression and generalised anxiety disorder occurred in only one-third of these patients.2 Studies have evaluated effects of CBT on different outcome measures, such as pain, function, work ability, or healthcare use, often presenting limited or no significant effects based on weak evidence.4\n\nMUS is not a clinical diagnosis but an analytical concept, unifying a diverse group of health problems where no joint cause or biomarker have been identified. Together MUS conditions dispute the idea that objective findings are needed to confirm subjective symptoms as disease. The biomedical disease model has imposed an unfortunate body–mind duality, with illness categorised as psychological when no objective findings are identified.2,4 Conceptualising MUS …",

This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters.

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders of childhood. Three quarters of anxiety disorders have their origins in childhood, with presentation often chronic in nature. Children with an anxiety disorder are 3.5 times more likely to experience depression or anxiety in adulthood, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Making a diagnosis can often prove difficult. It is important for clinicians to distinguish between normal anxiety and anxiety disorders. In the latter, symptoms may impair function and/or cause marked avoidance behaviour and significant distress. Younger children, who are less able to verbalise their anxiety, may show symptoms of regression of physical abilities (e.g. toileting, requiring carrying); increased attachment seeking behaviours (e.g. becoming more clingy); or increased physical symptoms (e.g. stomach aches). NICE quality standards recommend the need for an accurate assessment of which specific anxiety disorder the individual is experiencing, its severity, and the impact on functioning. NICE guidance for assessment of social anxiety disorder may be extrapolated to the assessment of other anxiety disorders: e.g. giving the child the opportunity to provide information on their own, and conducting a risk assessment. Where the child is experiencing significant distress or functional impairment (e.g. missing school, not taking part in age-appropriate activity), then specialist input is likely to be needed.",

      "title": "Chronic Back Pain as a Clinical Manifestation of Myofascial Pain Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a condition of muscle or fascial pain, acute or chronic, involving sensory, motor or autonomic function, which is associated with myofascial trigger points (TrP). The pain caused by TrP can cause various symptoms of chronic diseases, such as tension-type headaches, migraines, temporomandibular pain, shoulder pain, or lower back pain. Back pain that persists for more than 12 years is called chronic back pain. Case Report: A 24-year-old man came to the clinic with complaints of low back pain that had been intermittent for the previous month and felt worse for the last week. For 1 year, the patient has been diagnosed with non-specific back pain due to muscle stiffness. Since the last 1 week, the back pain has not improved, and the patient has begun to find it difficult to carry out activities such as sitting and squatting, and his hands cannot touch his feet when bending. The pain is said to be like pressure and radiates from the right buttock and back of the right thigh. The pain is aggravated if the patient stands and sits for a long time, the pain is reduced if the patient sleeps on his back. Complaints accompanied by tingling in the right buttock area spreading to the back of the right thigh. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was found to be 7 out of 10 for headaches. The patient is then given dry needling therapy and then observed for 30 minutes. The patient's NRS after the procedure was 2 out of 10. Discussion: In an epidemiological study, women experienced MPS more often than men, and it was found that the prevalence in women was 6 times higher than in men. Poor posture is a risk factor for chronic back pain. The diagnosis of myofascial pain is best made through a carefully analyzed pain history, which is confirmed by a consistent physical examination. TrP in the Piriformis muscle, Gluteus Minimus, and Gluteus Medius will cause symptoms of referred pain in the waist, buttocks, thighs and calves. MPS treatment in dry needling aims to restore functional ability by reducing pain caused by TrP. Conclusion: Chronic back pain can be a syndromic manifestation of MPS. A complete history and careful physical examination are significant in diagnosing MPS, the treatment given can reduce pain, rigidity and increase mobility in patients with MPS. Keywords: Chronic back pain, myofascial pain syndrome, myofascial trigger points.",

Psychological investigation revealed emotional immaturity after an unhappy childhood with many frustrations. There was no opportunity for deeper psychological treatment and supportive psychotherapy aided by hypnosis for symptom removal was used.

However, chronic pain often can produce depression, anxiety, and marital difficulties. Although physical examination and other studies, including x-ray studies, 3D-CT, electromyelograms (EMG), nerve conduction velocity studies and MRI in many cases may document an organic basis of chronic back pain, some organic syndromes defy definition by objective tests. This may be a greater problem for women, where physician prejudice can result in a significantly less extensive evaluation of their complaints of back pain. Also, any litigation may influence symptoms and the type of litigation may influence outcomes [8]. Therefore, there is a need to differentiate between “organic” and “functional” (negative physical and laboratory examination) back pain.",

Researchers have recognized that some disaster relief workers who have been exposed to various natural disasters could develop psychological injuries, such as major depression, chronic anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, as research on the psychosocial effects of disasters progressed, factors affecting the psychological injury rate became better known. One of the main determinants is the individual’s experience during the disaster: Crisis intervenors and disaster relief workers are not immune to stress reactions and stress responses. Each individual will respond differently to different situations depending on the severity of the crisis, the meaning the crisis represents to the intervenor, family, friends, or organizations. Yet, there are certain signs and symptoms that are associated with a maladaptive stress response.",

It must be remembered that not in all cases the same combination of symptoms occur as it is considered to schizophrenia as a heterogeneous disorder.

The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

      "title": "Stress, Immune System and the Brain",
      "abstract": "Stress encompasses the psychological perception of pressure from the environment, and the body’s physiological response to it. The sources of stress have evolved over time, from predation and natural disasters, to things like interpersonal conflicts and economic insecurities. While in the past, stressors evoked a very acute physical ‘fight or flight’ response, these events are rare in today’s terms. In contrast, the stressors we experience in the modern world are arguably more trivial – they are not often immediately life threatening – however they are more persistent, manifesting as a chronic, low level source of anxiety in our daily lives. The natural stress response involves multiple systems and is designed to provide short-term beneficial effects to the individual to help see them through a threatening situation. It is thought this response is mediated largely through glucocorticoid (GC) production and will rapidly normalize following the stressful event. In the event of chronic exposure to stress, some of these short-term physiological changes fail to return to ‘normality’, and as a result, the nature of our homeostasis is altered. This chapter will focus on the changes to the immune system and brain mediated through exposure to stress, with particular emphasis on the detrimental effects of chronic stress.",

      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders. Up to 20% of adults are affected by anxiety disorders each year. Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. Anxiety and worry associated with at least three of the following: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued, difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance.",

The disturbances induced constitute a psychoneurotoxic syndrome--\"a state of drunkenness\"--of about four hours duration which develops in three distinct phases. The basic mental symptoms of this syndrome consist of disturbances of the apperception, sensory perception and emotion. A moderate impairment of egofunctioning or reality appraisal and an inability to integrate different mental processes are observed. The psychomotor behavior is mainly harmonized to the prevailing emotional state and to the experiences caused by perceptual alterations, in a lesser degree. These changes, according to our observations, are more severe and more \"psychotic-like\" in schizophrenics rather than in normals. Psychopathological analysis of these changes proves that the whole syndrome cannot be considered as related to the spontaneously triggered functional psychoses or to the organic ones and, therefore, the term \"model-psychosis\" according to our opinion, is unsatisfactory.",

They are, when they exceed the subject's ability to cope with them in a physiological way. This level of stress is indicated as pathological stress. Addiction and pathological stress are strongly interrelated on several levels. Animal studies have shown that the pathological stress during the development may be the most important factor that brings the vulnerability for addiction to expression. Stress during pregnancy may have a decisive influence on brain development and the subject's ability to cope with stress during later life. Patients with post traumatic stress disorder have an increase risk for the development of substance use disorders. The brain reward system is a major target for the central and peripheral stress system. The catecholamines that mediate the stress response play an important role in the development of addiction. Addictive drugs such as stimulantia act as stressors by activating stress hormons. The process of craving is strongly associated with activated stress systems. Therefore, the adequate treatment of substance use disorders requires interventions that reduce pathological stress for the patient, either by diminishing environmental stress or by increasing the ability to cope with stress.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disabling; psychiatric disorder that affects around 1% of the population and its point prevalence is 0.6 to 8.3 cases per 1000 population. 1,2Caregiving in psychiatric illness is an exhausting and challenging activity that typically involves a considerable amount of energy, time and money over considerably long periods of time, in tasks that may be unpleasant or uncomfortable and could be psychologically and physically stressful and tiring.3\r\nCaregiving to mentally unstable people can be particularly challenging in traditional societies such as India. The close - knit family structure and lack of adequate government resources to support people with mental illness place the burden of care on the family which is perceived to be the ‘‘natural’’ caregiver. Socio-cultural expectations envision caregiving as an obligation and moral binding which is to be given by parents, children or the spouse. Religious-cultural attributions often causally implicate supernatural factors in the manifestation of mental illness.\r\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that usually starts in late adolescence or early adulthood, and is characterized by profound disruption in thinking, language, perception and the sense of self, and includes psychotic experiences, such as hearing voices or delusions. 6\r\nThe volatile nature of the disorder and its accompanying debilitating consequences burdens the family in multiple domains causing social, emotional and financial problems. Several studies had done worldwide reveal a high level of burden, social isolation and stigma among caregivers of schizophrenia. Indian data in this area is relatively sparse however some studies reports the presence of depression, anxiety, poor mental and physical health and other mental disorders among the caregivers. In view of the above the present study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of life and marital adjustment in spouses of schizophrenia patients.",

The second aspect of psychosomatic medicine suggests that specific somatic diseases are influenced by mental states.

The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently.

In today’s world, when fast pace of living and exposure to different risks is a common thing, people are more and more exposed to traumatic events and experiences, either as victims or witnesses of violence which can lead to development of post-traumatic stress disorder.\r\nA little more than twenty years ago Croatian history was marked by war and, although it finished, Croatia today is still facing its consequences, one of which is a large number of people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a complex psychiatric disorder that occurs since the beginning of the civilization, but only to be defined about thirty years ago. Post-traumatic stress disorder, like many other psychiatric disorders, affects not only the patient but also his family and his wider social surroundings. Over the time, the symptoms of the disorder progress and the disorder itself becomes chronic. Consequently, the patient’s ability to function in everyday life and work environment drops, and it only shows how important the early detection, treatment and prevention are for a patient. Post-traumatic stress disorder treatments involve pharmacotherapy, cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy and other psychotherapies.

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "abstract": "Between 25 and 30% of the victims of a whiplash injury have complaints after one year. This condition is referred to as late whiplash syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by pain of the neck, headache, forgetfulness, poor concentration, mental fatigue, and affective symptoms. The causes of the persistent symptoms are unknown. In all, the evidence that late-whiplash syndrome is a neurological disorder is flimsy. Current opinion holds that the acute basis is the painful injury of the neck. In the months following the accident, pain is the substrate on which psychological and social factors may act. Emotional symptoms such as lability of affect and disturbed mood, or posttraumatic stress disorders are common after whiplash. Although there is definitely a place for psychiatrists and psychologists in the treatment of late whiplash syndrome, these professionals are not involved in late whiplash disorder as much as they should be. Brief psychological treatment has proven to significantly reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. Optimal management must cover the treatment of pain, depression, anxiety, and fatigue; adequate psycho-education, stressing the good long-term outcome; and education of patients and relatives on possible cognitive symptoms.",

However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain, Psychopathology, and DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nThe neurophysiological mechanisms and comorbidities of anxiety and depression with chronic pain cited by the authors1 serve as evidence of correlation, not causality. When A (neurophysiological mechanism) and B (symptom of chronic pain) occur together, it cannot be concluded that A causes B, because it could just as well be that B causes A, or a third factor causes both. Regarding the comorbidity of chronic pain with anxiety or depression, it could be that these forms of psychological distress result from chronic pain due to physical impairment, that the pain is a symptomatic expression of anxiety or depression, or that underlying psychosocial issues are causing both. A mentor of mine used to say, “You can’t have a bad thought without a bad molecule, and you don’t know which comes first,” and this paper proves that adage.\r\n\r\nWhen a symptom or condition is diagnosed as psychosomatic, this should not be done solely by exclusion, that is, lack of objective medical evidence. There should be positive substantiation through identification of psychological factors that provide an understanding of what is going on in the life of the patient. The ability to at least ballpark such situations should be in the therapeutic armamentarium of every physician, while psychiatrists should be able to provide biopsychosocial formulations as a core skill. By doing so, we help our patients by empowering them to deal with real life problems, as opposed to placing them in a position of passivity as recipients of a medical solution. Problems occur when psychosomatic diagnoses are communicated poorly, such as “There’s nothing really wrong with you” or “It’s all in your head,” and when patients are not ready to assume psychological ownership of personal problems. Either of these can result in demonization of physicians who make such diagnoses, in the former case justifiably, not so the latter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the diagnosis of tension headaches seems to have disappeared from the medical lexicon, because everyone has migraines. Despite their potential severity, tension headaches are not seen as medical enough, place an onus on patients to deal with whatever source of tension is causing the headaches, and places physicians who make this diagnosis at risk of demonization for allegedly blaming patients and minimizing their suffering. By contrast, the diagnosis of migraine is perceived as more validating and more supportive, leading to a proliferation of migraine diagnoses and treatments.\r\n\r\nJust as the failure to make a medical diagnosis can have serious consequences in patients with chronic pain and other medically unexplained symptoms, so, too, can the neglect of a psychosomatic diagnosis, in terms of extensive and fruitless investigations and consultations, iatrogenic complications of questionable treatments, and reinforcement of illness–disabled role issues at the expense of dealing with real problems. The mind is more than the sum of the neurochemical parts of the brain, and the failure to recognize this places us at risk of falling into a mindless brand of psychiatry.2",

      "title": "Emotional Changes Following Brain Injury: Psychological and Neurological Components of Depression, Denial and Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Neurological components of depression, denial, and other affective changes are reviewed. Rehabilitation is particularly important to improve long-term psychological outcome of patients. Behavior modification can be used effectively to reduce problematic behavior and to support the patient's motivation. Finally, emotional changes in family members, which occur as well, are reviewed, particularly increased depression and anxiety. Emotional difficulties, personality changes, and neurotic reactions may be the most prominent consequences of head injury, especially in the case of mild head injuries. These reactions may be indistinguishable from psychoneurosis to those who are not intimately involved with the head injured individual. In fact, it is more typical for emotional disturbances to be interrelated components of neurologic or cognitive deficits, which can create difficulties in evaluating individual cases. Changes in coping ability caused by the injury are likely to result in reactive, adaptive, psysiologically-generated denial and depression. Changes in coping will often not be seen as multifactorial, and prominent emotional dynamics are likely to cloud underlying issues when problems occur in relationships. Altered coping also occurs in family members in response to the disabled person. A symmetrical process of frustration and helplessness is likely to develop when family members are unware of the organic causes of altered perceptions, coping, and poor judgment of the injured person. An example of thee processes is the case of a 35-year-old woman who sustained a mild head injury and spinal whisplash in an auto accident. She received medical treatment and some rehabilitation for her back and pain problems. Eventually she began to see a psychologist, whom she sought out on her own, because of an increasing depression. The psychologist treated her for a few months, but soon suspected another level to her difficulties and requested an neuropsychological evaluation. This evaluation uncovered significant cerebral dysfunctions which were not only affecting he reasoning and judgment, but also her personal relationships and outlook in major ways. Prior to the accident she had been a well adjusted person, outgoing, and happily employed. After the accident, among other problems, she was alienating her family and husband by being unable to read their emotional reactions as well as the underlying meanings of what they said to her. She perceived their comments in a restricted way-- only as an assault on her control and independence, and not as their attempts to help her see alternative solutions. Thus, attempts to talk through problems with her were unsuccessful because she was relating in a superficial and overly egocentric way. These decificts also meant that she would have great difficulty becoming aware of these or other problems because of the brain injury's affects on her self-awareness. When the family gave feedback to her, it became an exercise in frustration and rejection for her family, and an exercise in frustration and anger for her. Eventually she became more and more depressed in reaction to her neurological condition of denial. Almost three years after her injury, she admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital for triage of her depression. Lezak (1896) considers these types of individuals to be most at risk for serious depression because of the insidious process of alienation which they create as a result of their brain injuries. The neuropsychological evaluation of this case revealed bilateral anterior brain dysfunction, with greater right hemisphere than left hemisphere dysfunction at the time of the testing. This bilateral presence of injury was likely having significant effects on her ability to integrate her perceptions and feelings, to organize her thoughts and feelings, and on system-wide processes such as speed of perception and response. Some research indicates that when the brain is insulted in the right, or nondominant, hemisphere with preservation of the dominant hemisphere, denial, or lack of awareness, is a resulting syndrome. …",

The physical challenges of living with a vascular malformation will affect the patient's psychological health, and psychological factors will affect the patient's experience of their physical health. Psychological difficulties are typically the result of a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. As such, having a vascular malformation will not result in the same psychological outcomes for each young person. Having a new healthy baby is a known stressor that can precipitate a range of stress-related reactions in parents, including major mental health difficulties. When a child has physical health differences, the stress can increase as a result of uncertainty about the infant's health and development and the extra health care burden of hospital attendances and daily management at home.",

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

The DSM-III-R diagnostic classification (American Psychiatric Association), although the best mans for determining post-traumatic stress disorder, represents an ideal example for examining these problems while being, at the same time, a useful model for more exact classifications. In addition, by tackling the problems in this manner one gets a better understanding of the entire model for the occurrence of stress disorders: starting from the objective event, the traumatic experiences, the mediational factors to the appearance of acute and chronic after-effects of stress disorders.",

      "abstract": "The brain reciprocally communicates with the rest of the body via neural, endocrine, immune, and other systems. This is crucial for coordinating the complex behavioral and physiological responses needed to cope with the many challenges of life. The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is a key brain structure involved in assessing rewards and threats, as well as activating appropriate responses. This is a dynamic process that depends on evolving needs and challenges. Important challenges include illness or injury. These typically involve inflammation and pain, which evoke neuroinflammatory processes in the brain to drive sickness behaviours. In the short term, sickness behaviours are considered adaptive, as they promote convalescence (e.g. low mood; lethargy, fatigue, social withdrawal), and enhanced threat appraisal (e.g. anxiety) to combat increased risk/vulnerability associated with sickness. Chronic inflammation, however, appears to remodel the system to inappropriately activate threat-coping responses, resulting in depressive and/or anxious phenotypes. These mood disorders are particularly pronounced in diseases and disorders associated with gut dysfunction, which feature chronic inflammation and altered ACC function. We propose that chronic inflammation remodels ACC physiology such that it errantly predicts heightened danger based on a mental model (a.k.a &amp;lsquo;schema&amp;rsquo;) of the world. This evokes chronic activation of threat-coping systems, including endocrine signaling (e.g. adrenaline), and anxiety. Inflammation can be driven by brain systems involving ACC, leading to a feedback-cycle that self-reinforces pathological states. This theory accounts for a wealth of clinical and preclinical data that implicate the ACC in disorders of mood and gastrointestinal function, and reveals a key player in the gut-brain axis that may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

      "title": "Efecto de una intervención psicoeducativa para disminuir el Síndrome Burnout en personal de confianza de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYModern life imposes several different labor demands on humanbeings; thus, bringing about stressing situations. All those eventsperceived as threatening bringing about tension are called stressors.A stressing situation comes about when there exists a discrepancybetween environment demands and adequate resources to cope withthem. All these factors lead to physiological, cognitive and motorresponses which enhance perception and create the need of bettersolutions to allow appropriate adaptation behaviors.When stress is present at the workplace in a recurrent fashion, itis known as Labor Stress (LS), an alarming circumstance affectingindividuals and organizations. Main causes of LS are: physicalconditions, schedule, work position, interpersonal relations and otherorganizational variables.Labor Stress is a public health and a labor health problem, for itis related to an increase in labor accident, morbidity and absenteeismrates; thus, generating negative attitudes that yield economic loss toinstitutions.The Burnout Syndrome (BS) is a response to chronically laborstress manifested through emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,as well as hostile and aggressive attitudes toward workmates andservice users, resulting in a feeling of poor personal development.ObjectiveAssess the effect of a psycho-educative intervention to decrease BS inmanaging or directive employees from one sector of CFEGuadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.Materials and methodologyA quasi-experimental study was carried out; this included measure-ments prior and after educative intervention carried out on confidenceemployees from CFE Guadalajara from Februa ry through September2005.The study sample was made up of 29 managing or directiveemployees, conforming four groups; one random-selected groupreceived educative intervention; the other three were control groups;different questionnaires were applied: personal data, psycho-socialfactors and BS through the Maslach Burnout Inventory Scale (MBI).From a participativ e-educational view point, encouraged by thePan-American Health Organization (PHO), the educative interventionsought health promotion through the betterment and consistency ofmental and physical wellbeing.All BS concepts as well as psychological factors were analyzed.Other workshop included the development of preventing, coping andtreatment strategies at individual and social levels. F inally, a correctiveprogram directed to decreasing psychological risk factors in theorganization was encouraged. Also, a post-intervention assessmentwas applied.ResultsSubjects had an average age of 31.5 ± 6.8 years; 52% were females;group 1 decreased for all indicators; emotional exhaustion from 71%to 29%; depersonalization from 43% to 14%; lack of personaldevelopment from 57% to 14%. However, no significant differencewas found in both groups by sex.DiscussionIn personnel with specific responsibilities, obligations, opportunities,challenges and rewards based on their performance work environmentoften drives them to frustration and despair. When the employeebelieves that gives more than he receives, he becomes emotionallyexhausted and more even if he do not have the resources to cope withthe prospect of work. Also, it is documented that at younger age thereis an increased risk of presenting the Burnout.This is because interpersonal relationships are more contentiousbecause of the lack of experience in management. In the seriesreported, on both groups we were not able to document thisrelationship, but still, there is a lack of an international consensus torecognize this as a risk factor.Mingote describes that when the employee has less than fiveyears working, they are often idealistic, utopian dreamers, unlikethose with more than ten years in the job and are in risk of experiencingmonotony at work, loss of interest and the downgrade.Also, this type of workers is subject to overtime. This excessproduces physical and mental stress and leads to lower feelings ofpersonal accomplishment. Even though there could be resourcesfor coping with the monotony at work and that provides resources",

Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

      "title": "Compulsive Sexual Behaviors in a Young Male with Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behaviours are relatively rare and are not known to be associated with social phobias, with an intense scientific debate on going if it constitutes a behavioral addiction. Compulsive sexual behaviours otherwise known as Hypersexuality/problematic sexual behaviour and is identified by a persistent pattern of failure to control repetitive, intense urges, fantasies and behaviours of a sexual nature over an extended period of time that causes marked impairment in multiple areas of functioning, in this case, especially educational functioning. Phobic anxiety disorders also known as social phobias are a group of conditions in which anxiety is triggered typically in well-defined situations that are not currently dangerous with resulting avoidance of such situations. Nevertheless, CSB is not captured in DSM V and ICD10, although, diagnostic criteria were proposed during DSM V revision, it is not currently recognized in the DSMV. Although, CSB has been proposed for inclusion in ICD 11 as an impulse control disorder, rather than as a mental and behavioural disorder as previously debated, in addition, strict diagnostic guidelines were instituted due to concerns of over pathologizing sexual behaviours. This presents a diagnostic and treatment dilemma for the psychiatrist when a patient presents with symptoms of Compulsive sexual behaviours with or without anxiety, since there are presently no diagnostic and treatment guidelines. We present the case of a 23 year old 3rd year medical student with a 5 year history of compulsive masturbation, persistent pornography viewing, failure to resist impulses and fantasies with accompanying intense distress especially following periods of abstinence and a two year history of recurrent panic attacks in social settings in which women were triggers complicated by depressive symptoms, symptoms significantly impaired most areas of functioning particularly his academics.\r\n\r\n A diagnosis of Social Phobia/Social Anxiety disorder with episodic panic attacks and compulsive sexual behaviours and mild depressive episode was made because patient met criteria according to ICD 10 and proposed ICD 11. Mental state examination shows anxious mood, congruent with affect, depersonalization, derealization as well as anxious ruminations. Within a year, after commencement of an SSRI, Atenolol and Lisonopril and CBT all anxiety symptoms resolved with marked reduction in the frequency of pornography viewing as well as compulsive masturbation with associated fantasies. This case report lends voice to the on-going debate about the inclusion of compulsive sexual behaviours as a mental and behavioural disorder Dependence syndrome in diagnostic classification systems as well as the need for development of standardized appropriate treatment modalities. This case report will highlight Compulsive Sexual Behaviours, rationale for its inclusion as an addiction in classification systems and treatment approaches to the disorder.",

In cancer patients, it is defined as ‘distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning’. In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue. Initial management should aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes However, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered.",

These entities are usually defined as clusters of symptoms and signs, to which time course and degree of impairment are sometimes added. Such emphasis on an atheoretical phenomenology is aimed at enhancing agreement among clinicians and investigators and is expected to facilitate objective research. The process leading to the formation of clinical features, whether psychodynamic, psychophysiologic, or both, is usually considered to be secondary in diagnostic importance (with the exception of recognizable immediate organic or situational causes), and many times is completely ignored. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the exceptions to the above rule because of the emphasis on the past psychologic trauma as the stressor.

At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials.

      "title": "Relationship between Postpartum Depression, Infant Temperament and Childcare Stress in Tirana, Albania",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe postpartum period represents one of the most important life stages of women in which the accurate detection and treatment of psychological distress is required. Postpartum Depression (PPD) is a depression episode that begins within six months after birth and matches the criteria of DSM - IV for major depression without psychotic consequences (1). The prevalence of PPD is about 8-35% depending on the method used for evaluation (2). PPD occurs when there is an increase in demands on a new mother due to the child development.Many different risk factors have been found to be at least moderately correlated with the presence of postpartum depression (3). These risk factors include a history of depression (preconception or prenatal), high stress level, high anxiety, and little or no social support. Although no single factor can be attributed to predicting postpartum depression, the combination of factors does seem very important in understanding both the short and long term outcomes as well as what strategies might be best for intervention.Characteristic symptoms of PPD are similar to those of major depression including: sadness, despair, anxiety, compulsive thoughts, and appetite and sleep disturbances. A new mother with PPD may also have thoughts of harming herself and/or her infant (4). In addition to directly affecting a new mother's mental health, PPD can interfere with a mother's ability to recognize and respond to the needs of her infant, increasing the risk for delays in infant development and behavioral problems in childhood (5). Consequently, PPD is considered a major form of depression which requires treatment and identification of women who may be at an increased risk. Lack of diagnosis of PPD can affect the mother, her child, family members, and society through medical expense, social dysfunction, illness, and even death (6).Postpartum depression and child characteristicsVarious studies have reported that child related factors were associated with postpartum depression. Cutrona (7) reported that high levels of child care related stressors were associated with high levels of depressive symptomatology, while Hopkins, Campbell and Marcus (8) found that having a difficult baby, or a baby with neonatal complications, was associated with a diagnosis of postpartum depression.Beck (9) studied two variables related to the infant; child temperament and childcare stress. She found that childcare stress and having an infant with a difficult temperament were moderately predictive of postpartum depressive symptomatology. It has been found that mothers suffering from postpartum depression give more negative descriptions of their children and report more behavioral problems in their infants, than control mothers (10). Therefore, the mothers' symptoms may be a source of bias in the reporting of infant characteristics.The early postpartum period is a time of potential stress for the mother as she assumes increasing responsibility in the parenting role (11,12). Symptoms of depressed mood emerge and occur more frequently during this stage (12). Since infant behavioral patterns also take shape early, it is possible that difficult temperament may either influence or be influenced by the maternal psychological state at this early postpartum stage (9,13,14).In this study the relationship between infant temperament, child care stress and postpartum depression during the first year postpartum is assessed. Temperament refers to individual differences in an infant's expressions of arousal and emotion and describes infant self-regulation, reactivity, and modulation (15). Emerging temperamental difficulty may affect maternal interactions with the infant and may shape her future expectations of the child, potentially posing a stress upon the parent-infant relationship (16). Child care stress refers to the mother's perception of infant health problems, problems with baby feeding and problems related to baby sleep. …",

      "abstract": "Dementia is an increasing global issue, currently affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide. This number is predicted to increase to 82 million by the year 2030, due to the ageing global population. Theoretically,\r\npreventing late-onset dementia may seem extremely difficult as the greatest risk factor, age, is unmodifiable.\r\nHowever, it is estimated that a third of dementia cases could potentially be prevented or delayed by removing\r\nor reducing modifiable risk factors. Increasing evidence suggests that chronic stress, which may arise from\r\nexperiencing a traumatic event or daily stress, may be a potential risk factor for dementia. Whilst it may not play\r\na vital role in causing the syndrome, stress may contribute to the progression of cognitive decline, which is the\r\nmain symptom of dementia. The primary stress hormone, cortisol, may have detrimental effects on cognitive\r\nbrain regions when its levels are elevated for long durations. Preliminary evidence suggests that stress may\r\nhave different effects on brain structure and function, depending on the individual’s age when exposed to the\r\nstress. Stress during early and later life may lead to more permanent brain changes, which may contribute to\r\ncognitive decline in later life. Limited evidence links chronic stress or major trauma at specific stages of the\r\nlifespan, with cognitive decline and incidence of dementia. Whether or not an accumulation of stress across\r\nthe lifespan influences later life cognition and risk of dementia, still remains to be determined. Understanding\r\nto what extent stressful events are risk factors for later-life cognitive decline and dementia will be crucial to the\r\nimplementation of targeted psychosocial interventions efforts.",

      "title": "Cardiovascular response to stress",
      "abstract": "The behavioral characteristics of psychological stressors have been operationally defined. A psychological stressor is one that causes a stress response in a predictable percentage of index subjects. However, it may not always produce a stress response, and the probability of producing such a response depends on interactions between the behavioral situation and the individual involved. Thus there is a danger that a psychological stressor will be defined according to the stress response it causes rather than its structural characteristics. The characteristics that enhance the likelihood that a psychological stressor will cause a stress response are its novel, challenging, or threatening aspects that engage a subject in continuous active mental effort. The intensity of the stress response depends on the intensity of mental effort exerted to meet a challenging situation, whether or not that situation is perceived as threatening. The behavioral response to a psychological stressor also has been defined. It includes somatomotor, neuroendocrine, and cardiovascular components. The somatomotor response to stressful psychological events includes purposeful active coping to counter the challenge or threat posed by the stressor. The neuroendocrine response includes a combination of pituitary-adrenal cortical and hypothalamic-sympathetic-adrenal medullary secretions. The cardiovascular response includes a combination of increased rate and force of cardiac contraction, skeletal muscle vasodilation, venoconstriction, splanchnic vasoconstriction, renal vasoconstriction, and decreased renal excretion of sodium. Of all the modifiers that influence the stress response to a psychological stressor, family history is the one most likely to have an effect. A family history of essential hypertension increases the likelihood that a subject will respond to a psychological stressor with a cardiovascular stress response pattern. Other predisposing characteristics that increase the likelihood of a stress response include behavioral patterns of response to challenge or threat but may also include anatomic or biochemical characteristics that increase susceptibility to neurogenic activation of central aminergic mechanisms.",

      "title": "Childhood depression: early risk and resilience and introducing solids to infants",
      "abstract": "The carefree exuberance associated with young children can make the concept of childhood depression difficult to imagine. It is not surprising then that the existence of mood disorders in children has gained acceptance only in the last few decades. While debate continues regarding conceptualisations of childhood depression, evidence from over 20 years of research suggests that the major affective disorders often begin early in life. This article will outline current knowledge of childhood depression, including recent etiological evidence and implications. There is no formal diagnostic category specifically for childhood depression, with the mood disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) intended to apply to both adults and children. The key feature of clinical depression is a persistently depressed mood, or pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. However, for children and adolescents, this mood may be one of irritability rather than sadness. Associated symptoms include feelings of worthlessness, concentration problems, energy loss, and unusual changes in appetite or weight. These symptoms may occur in the context of major depressive disorder, which is marked by acute depressive episodes lasting at least two weeks, or in dysthymic disorder, in which such symptoms persist chronically for at least two years. Also grouped with the mood disorders is bipolar disorder, which is characterised by intermittent manic episodes. While this article focuses on unipolar depression, much of this information may apply to the less understood disorder of bipolar depression also. --------------------- For a number of years there had been some controversy over the appropriate timing of complementary foods to infants. It is with this background that the World Health Organisation (WHO) requested a review of the literature to establish the appropriateness of their recommendations. As a consequence, new guidelines were released in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The new guidelines recommend that complementary foods should be delayed until 6 months. It has been stressed in the literature review, however, that this is a population based recommendation and that infants must be managed individually so that appropriate interventions are provided (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004). By all standards of good nutrition, babies younger than four months who are exclusively breast-fed, or appropriately artificially fed, should not be given solids. The case for delaying complementary foods is based on the health of breast-fed infants and their mothers. The strongest evidence for the recommendation from the infants’ perspective is a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the absence of any growth deficit. For mothers, the benefit is in prolonged lactational amenorrhoea and greater post-partum weight loss (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004).",

      "abstract": "Migraine is a common disabling primary headache disorder that affects an estimated 36 million A mericans. Migraine headaches often occur over many years or over an individual's lifetime. By definition, episodic migraine is characterized by headaches that occur on fewer than 15 days per month. According to the recent I nternational C lassification of H eadache D isorders (third revision) beta diagnostic criteria, chronic migraine is defined as “headaches on at least 15 days per month for at least 3 months, with the features of migraine on at least 8 days per month.” However, diagnostic criteria distinguishing episodic from chronic migraine continue to evolve. Persons with episodic migraine can remit, not change, or progress to high‐frequency episodic or chronic migraine over time. Chronic migraine is associated with a substantially greater personal and societal burden, more frequent comorbidities, and possibly with persistent and progressive brain abnormalities. Many patients are poorly responsive to, or noncompliant with, conventional preventive therapies. The primary goals of migraine treatment include relieving pain, restoring function, and reducing headache frequency; an additional goal may be preventing progression to chronic migraine. Although all migraineurs require abortive treatment, and all patients with chronic migraine require preventive treatment, there are no definitive guidelines delineating which persons with episodic migraine would benefit from preventive therapy. Five US F ood and D rug A ssociation strategies are approved for preventing episodic migraine, but only injections with onabotulinumtoxin A are approved for preventing chronic migraine. Identifying persons who require migraine prophylaxis and selecting and initiating the most appropriate treatment strategy may prevent progression from episodic to chronic migraine and alleviate the pain and suffering associated with frequent migraine.",

Here we report on a patient who emerged from a traumatic vegetative state after 20 months. Beginning from the 6th month, we observed an improvement in the event-related potentials (ERPs) of his brain to complex sensory and verbal stimulation, although the clinical examinations remained unchanged. The possible role of ERPs as predictors of regaining consciousness after a vegetative state is discussed.\n\nThe vegetative state is a most severe neurological syndrome and includes the loss of all kinds of conscious behaviour despite preserved wakefulness.1 In patients with traumatic head injury, a vegetative state that holds for more than 1 year is considered to be “permanent”, which implies irreversibility. In fact, even minimal improvement after this period is extremely improbable. From time to time, however, cases of late emergence are reported,2,3 sometimes even 5 years after the incident.4 The statement “The available data are insufficient to provide a trustworthy estimate of the incidence of late improvement” (Childs and Merger,3 p 24) is still valid; figures varying as broadly as from 1.6% to 14% have been reported.1,3\n\nGiven the rarity of such cases, the slightest hint that such an unexpected improvement may occur would be useful.

In older people, the relationship between depression and impaired social functioning and quality of life is complex and ill defined. Despite well-tolerated and effective treatments, many depressed individuals are undiagnosed or under-treated. The impact of depression on the quality of life (QOL) and social functioning of older people can be considerable. Furthermore, impairment of social functioning, consequent on the social isolation and functional disability that goes hand-in-hand with ageing, may be a causative factor in old age depression. Once depression develops, it may result in further narrowing of social repertoire, compounding the problem. Notwithstanding some of the difficulties in measuring social functioning and quality of life, progress has been made in defining the extent of these problems in older depressed individuals. The impact treatment of depression has on these parameters is becoming increasingly recognised and evaluated in clinical trials.",

Behaviourally, PTSD reflects a strategy of defence involving avoidance, attentive immobility, withdrawal, aggressive defence, appeasement, and tonic immobility, some of which are ancient vertebrate heritage. These defence mechanisms are preceded by heightened vigilance and risk assessment. Persistent stress responses often occur when important biosocial goals had been thwarted by the traumatic event. Species with long life-history patterns may be more vulnerable to developing PTSD than species with short life cycles.",

The differential diagnosis of OCD can be quite difficult since OCD symptomatology can occur as either primary or secondary phenomena. Comorbid depression or personality disorder is not uncommon in patients with primary OCD. Other comorbid conditions that occur with OCD can be divided into three major groups based on core features: (1) disorders of altered risk assessment; (2) incompleteness/habit-spectrum disorders; and (3) psychotic spectrum disorders. Such a categorization of core dimensions and comorbid conditions may prove useful in identifying distinct OCD subtypes that share underlying neurobiological or treatment response characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience that is influenced by genetics, gender, social, cultural and personal parameters. Opposed to chronic pain, which by definition has to last for at least 3 months, acute pain is mostly because of trauma, acute medical conditions or treatment. The link between mood disorders and acute pain has proven to be increasingly significant since the link is bi-directional, and both act as risk factors for each other. Depression and anxiety are associated with increased perception of pain severity, whereas prolonged duration of acute pain leads to increased mood dysregulation. Although both depression and anxiety have a proven association with acute pain, the link between depression and acute pain is more thoroughly studied. Pain can be the presenting or sole complaint in depressed patients who present to primary care practices and is often overlooked by clinicians. However, reports on the perception of experimentally-induced pain in depressed patients are mixed, showing both an increased and decreased pain threshold and pain tolerance across various studies. Although less data is published about anxiety and pain, the relationship is consistent across studies as increased anxiety leads to increased severity of pain perceived and decreased pain tolerance. Anxiety as well as fear, stress, and catastrophizing are also shown to be mediators in the causal pathway between pain and disability.",

Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives. The types of Stress are Acute Stress and Chronic Stress. Acute Stress is the body’s quick reaction to a new and challenging situation whereas chronic stress is Long-term stress experienced for an extended period which can create a negative impact on a person’s health. Things that cause stress are “stressors,” and stress is the personal reaction to that stressors. A number of scientists classified stressors as Biological Stressors, Psychological Stressors, Acute Stressors, Chronic Stressors, Environmental Stressors, Internal Stressors and Psychosocial Stressors. Stress is influenced by internal and external factors of a person. Stress causes different types of impacts on the physical body. Stress has negative consequences on various aspects of quality of life. Chronic stress can lead to or exacerbate mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, bipolar disorder, cognitive (thinking) problems, personality changes, and problem behaviours. Stress management techniques help to reduce stress. Understanding the sources of stress provides opportunities for planning interventions that would reduce the stressors.",

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

The field is characterised by lively debates, including about the extent to which human suffering should be medicalised and the purportedly inflationary expansion of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses. The ICD-11 Working Group on this topic was asked to review scientific evidence and other information on use, clinical utility, and experience with relevant ICD-10 diagnoses in various health care settings; to review proposals for the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 and consider how these may be suited for global applications; and to assemble proposals for ICD-11 with a focus on improving clinical utility. The Working Group has recommended a separate grouping of 'Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress' for ICD-11, rather than combining them with anxiety disorders as in ICD-10 or DSM-IV. Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress have two key characteristics: 1) they are identifiable based on psychopathology that differs from other mental disorders; and 2) they arise in specific association with a stressful event or series of events. For each disorder in the grouping, the stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. The stressor may range from negative life events within the normal range of experience (in the case of adjustment disorder) to traumatic stressors of exceptional severity (in the case of PTSD and Complex PTSD).",

      "abstract": "By dictionary definition, an emergency is any sudden state of affairs which demands immediate action. In psychiatric terms there are at least three ways of looking at such an event: (1) the medical viewpoint. Doctors and hospitals are used to coping with physical emergencies in the course of their daily work. Therefore, when some abnormal mental state is the cause of the emergency the remedy is most frequently seen in terms of some form of medical intervention, usually implying the administration of drugs. (2) the psychological viewpoint. This is less concerned to classify overt symptoms and more willing to see the person in distress as somehow failing to cope with some stressful situation. This failure to cope may be due to the sheer size and impact of the stress or indicative of some breakdown of the usual defensive mechanisms, either because the ego is underdeveloped and therefore vulnerable, or because it has been undermined by illness. (3) the social worker's viewpoint. An emergency may be seen as being concerned less with the disturbance within one individual than with a breakdown within a system or a wider group. In these terms the focus shifts from a concern with one person and moves to a consideration of that person within the context of friends, neighbours and relatives.",

In recent years the subject of When, and even How is raised with increasing frequency, and the patient expects the physician to reply with appropriate answers. The reply must be tempered by the level of the patient's recovery, the evaluation of what other activities the patient can perform without pain or with minimal pain and the method to be used. Sexual activity may precipitate recurrent pain or aggravate existing pain in the same manner as lifting, pushing, pulling or any other physical activity, if performed too early or too vigorously in the course of recovery from neck, back or radicular pain syndromes. In dealing with the problem of recovery from painful musculoskeletal or neuromuscular states, timing is of the utmost importance. Unless a timetable is specifically outlined, recurrences are common, and the condition may become chronic. The inability of the patient to deal satisfactorily with the sexual aspect of his daily living may, in itself, lead to emotional tensions and guilt feelings which may delay or prevent recovery.

However, people who scored higher on measures of depressive symptoms and pessimism rebounded from the negative induced mood less strongly than others.Positive and negative emotional states operate largely independently and are differentially influenced by mood clarity, depressive symptoms, and pessimism.

We propose that chronic stress is best understood as a series of acute stress responses, and that these responses become maladaptive when they occur frequently or are of long duration. We focus on the factors that contribute to chronic stress: whether the presence of a stressor, real or imagined, is long‐lived and/or frequent (repeated activation), the degree to which the stressor is perceived as a threat even when no longer present (low or slow adaptation), and the extent to which the duration of responding is prolonged (delayed or failure to return to homeostasis). Importantly, we examine how perseverative cognitions (such as rumination and worry) contribute to chronic stress by creating and sustaining acute stress responses, largely via influencing activation, adaptation, and return to homeostasis. Finally, we discuss the implications of our stress model: that interventions can be ideographically tailored to address how an individual is experiencing chronic stress; that researchers may be better able to identify specific characteristics of chronic stress that relate most strongly to poor health; and that moderators of chronic stress may function through these contributing factors rather than via general effects on the system.",

This at least is the feeling of many professionals in the field of child development in Britain, who believe that in recent years they have been seeing more children with autistic spectrum disorders. Autism was first characterised in 1943 by Kanner,1 who described a group of children with an unusual pattern of behaviour present from birth or before 30 months. He called this “early infantile autism.” His essential criteria for diagnosis were social aloofness and elaborate repetitive routines.2 Subsequent epidemiological studies have shown that autism is not, as Kanner first thought, a unique and separate condition occurring in children of otherwise normal development but that it is closely related to a range of developmental disorders.3 4 These include Asperger's syndrome,5 a condition characterised by borderline or normal IQ; social isolation or naive, inappropriate social interaction; intensive interest in only one or two subjects; a narrow, repetitive life style; limited or inappropriate intonation and body language; and poor motor coordination.\n\nAutistic spectrum disorders share a triad of impaired social interaction, communication, and imagination, associated with a rigid, repetitive pattern of behaviour.

      "title": "Role of Social Support as a Mediator in Negative Stressful Life Event and Somatic Complaints of Managerial Personnel",
      "abstract": "In this Complex life scenario employees have to face different challenging task that either related to work or to day to day life situation, both of these causes some sort of problem to employees. Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

It is experienced as thoughts and feelings as well as in the body. Another way to define stress could be as an internal and conditioned response to external pressures. Mental health professionals often help people reduce and manage their stress. They can also help people work through other mental health issues that have developed while coping with high levels of stress over a period of time. The American Institute of Stress calls stress “America’s leading health problem.” In many cases, the stress Americans experience today is a response to psychological threats. Some of these threats might be losing a job or looking for employment, the death of a loved one, or relationship issues. Any of these can occur more than once in the course of a life",

Although the explicit etiology is unknown, serotonergic dysfunction may be involved. Dysthymia appears to have a high rate of comorbidity, including both psychiatric and medical disorders. The primary care physician should maintain an awareness of this mood disorder, be able to screen efficiently for signs and symptoms, and be able to differentiate major depression from dysthymia. The foundation of treatment is pharmacotherapy, in particular with serotonergic antidepressants, although response is moderate at best. Antidepressants are initiated at low doses and drug trials are conducted for 3-month periods if not precluded by side effects. When reasonably effective, antidepressants should be continued for 2 to 3 years or more. Adjunctive interventions in the treatment of dysthymia are based on comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions. Although dysthymia is an insidious, difficult-to-treat disorder, intervention is worthwhile. Further research may elucidate more effective interventions for this challenging disorder.",

Physical or psychological demands, known as stressors, can cause strain. Stress can be identified as the process in the body for adapting to influences, changes, demands, and strains to which it is exposed. Stress caused by a working environment is known as occupational stress and globally considered to be among the topmost serious health issues. Stress and burnout have reached all-time highs across various professions as stressors have become assiduous and indeterminate - employers and employees alike are scrambling to return to normalcy in the working environment. Burnout results from the physical, mental, and psychological reactions from experiencing prolonged stress. Burnout, considered an occupational phenomenon rather than a medical condition, is often exacerbated with depression and anxiety leading to concerns of employee well-being and mental health. The progressive escalation of occupational stress and burnout has gained attention from global organizations and as the nature of work continues to evolve, understanding occupational stress can support initiatives for managing it.",

      "title": "Stress-Related Immune Markers in Depression: Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Major depression is a serious psychiatric disorder; however, the precise biological basis of depression still remains elusive. A large body of evidence implicates a dysregulated endocrine and inflammatory response system in the pathogenesis of depression. Despite this, given the heterogeneity of depression, not all depressed patients exhibit dysregulation of the inflammatory and endocrine systems. Evidence suggests that inflammation is associated with depression in certain subgroups of patients and that those who have experienced stressful life events such as childhood trauma or bereavement may be at greater risk of developing depression. Consequently, prolonged exposure to stress is thought to be a key trigger for the onset of a depressive episode. This review assesses the relationship between stress and the immune system, with a particular interest in the mechanisms by which stress impacts immune function, and how altered immune functioning, in turn, may lead to a feed forward cascade of multiple systems dysregulation and the subsequent manifestation of depressive symptomology. The identification of stress-related immune markers and potential avenues for advances in therapeutic intervention is vital. Changes in specific biological markers may be used to characterize or differentiate depressive subtypes or specific symptoms and may predict treatment response, in turn facilitating a more effective, targeted, and fast-acting approach to treatment.",

      "title": "Treatment‐resistant depression invites persistent reflection",
      "abstract": "As admirably detailed by McIntyre et al1, most definitions of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) weight failure to respond to a set of antidepressant medications and other physical treatment options. Is this the optimal paradigm when major depressive episodes may be caused not only by biological factors, but also by social and psychological ones? Wouldn't we expect, for example, that a woman depressed due to abuse by a coercive husband, or a man whose procrastinating perfectionism leads his manager to heap opprobrium and deep depression on him, fails to respond to two or three antidepressants of different classes and at appropriate doses? If the incorrect treatment paradigm is employed in the latter instances (i.e., antidepressant medication rather than respective social and psychological interventions being prioritized) is non-response better viewed as \"treatment failure\" (and accorded TRD status) or more as \"paradigm failure\"? Similarly, delivery of multiple psychotherapy approaches alone to an individual with severe melancholic depression might generate TRD status but more correctly reflect paradigm failure. In concept and operation, most TRD models and definitions constrain the heterogeneity of depressive disorders and then effect a Procrustean management model weighted to physical treatments. McIntyre et al1 consider an alternate \"difficult-to-treat\" framework, which they regard as relying more on a biopsychosocial approach. Such an approach theoretically allows alternative definitional and management strategies. The authors note that psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as first-line strategies for those with mild or moderately severe depressions. This might allow TRD definition to be weighted by baseline depression severity. For example, for those with \"severe\" depression, TRD status would be assigned by failure to respond to a sequential and operationalized set of drug and physical treatment strategies, thus weighting their management to biological treatments, while those with less severe depression would achieve TRD status by failure to respond to cogent psychotherapies. However, immediate concerns about such a model include severity of depression not being linked with depressive subtype, while \"failure to respond\" to a cogent psychotherapy would be limited by judging of \"cogency\". A second option would emphasize a biopsychosocial definition (e.g., failure to respond to a therapeutic intervention salient to cause – including psychological and social determinants and not biological ones alone) and weight a subtyping model as against a severity-based one. Such a model would aim for TRD status to be operationalized in relation to specified biologically-weighted depressive conditions (i.e., melancholia, psychotic depression, bipolar I and II depression, depression caused by medical conditions) and a set of residual non-melancholic depressive conditions with presumed social and/or psychological causes. Differing type-specific criteria for according TRD status, and logical type-specific sequential management strategies, would be developed. Rather than seeking a TRD definition that has universal application, do we not need one that has disorder-specific nuances as is observable in general medicine? Turning to narrower issues, McIntyre et al importantly note that some people meeting TRD status do so as a consequence of being \"rapid metabolizers\". Such a state affects up to 30% of some races, but is a TRD determinant that may be overlooked by practitioners. The clinical clues are that the individual rarely has side effects from any antidepressant medication, is seemingly unaffected by moderate amounts of alcohol, and fails to obtain analgesic benefit from paracetamol. In my pursuit of this possibility, I do not find genomic testing informative but, less anecdotally, note a report by De Leon et al2 quantifying that up to 80% of ultra-metabolizers are missed by genetic testing. I generally initiate a tricyclic (TCA), increase its dose to 150 mg/day and then obtain a \"tricyclic level\", finding serum TCA level results to have high sensitivity and specificity3. The impact on management is that some people whose TRD status is so established then become \"responders\" when taking a higher dose of the TCA (although TCA metabolites may produce serious side effects). Further, some people with rapid metabolizing status can be \"converted\" to normal metabolizing status by adding paroxetine or fluoxetine, with De Leon et al2 noting that such a strategy increases the concentration of the active drug and reduces the concentration of the hydroxylated metabolites. Some TRD criteria include failure to respond to two or more antidepressants of differing classes – a non-specific model which allows random progression from narrow-action to broader-action antidepressant classes, but also allows the converse and other sequences. Unspecified progression might be appropriate if all antidepressant classes have comparable efficacy, which is the general finding in relation to treating \"major depression\". However, broad-action tricyclics have been quantified as superior to narrow-action selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in those with melancholic depression, with differential effectiveness increasing with older age of the patient4, while the dual-action antidepressants appear to have intermediate efficacy. Any such gradient might then logically argue for a TRD management model whereby those with melancholia not responding to an SSRI then receive a broader-action antidepressant – perhaps a dual-action antidepressant, followed by a TCA, and then possibly a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) – with MAOIs long positioned as strong candidates for managing treatment-resistant melancholia5. While I have previously employed MAOIs when narrow- or dual-action antidepressants failed in those with a melancholic depression, I now trial augmentation of a baseline antidepressant drug with a psychostimulant (e.g., methylphenidate or dexamphetamine) prior to any trialling of an MAOI – in light of dietary and other concerns related to the MAOIs. While earlier meta-analyses of psychostimulants failed to indicate distinct efficacy, a more recent meta-analysis by McIntyre et al6 supported their efficacy, but with these authors suggesting that their benefits might operate across \"select domains\". I view melancholia as being one such key domain, finding such psychostimulant augmentation commonly beneficial in those with melancholia who have failed to respond to several antidepressants, and with tolerance rarely emerging. A recent review7 summarized two previous reports of people with unipolar and bipolar melancholic depression meeting common TRD criteria (subjects having received a mean of five previous antidepressants in both samples, and seven and eight psychotropic drugs in total across the two samples). Overall, some 20% reported the psychostimulant augmentation as \"very effective\", while an additional one-half reported the strategy as \"somewhat effective\". Some 45% described the psychostimulant as the best or equal best to previously prescribed antidepressants, and 48% reported a sustained benefit. Such effectiveness rates in those with TRD are impressive, and argue for such a strategy being trialled – in those with melancholia – before more demanding treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy are enlisted. While major depression is a diagnostic entity, it is not a clinical entity8. To the extent that TRD status is defined by failure of people with major depression to respond to multiple antidepressants, then TRD is also not an entity. Then, it must be expected that its specific and fuzzy-set constituent conditions will show differential response gradients to differing interventions. McIntyre et al provide an extraordinarily rich review of current definitions and management options, and thus set up a base camp for future exploratory studies. These will benefit from the recognition that heterogeneity reigns and needs to be constrained.",

      "title": "Chronic fatigue syndrome: it's tiring not knowing much—an in-depth review for occupational health professionals",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an incredibly common symptom in medical settings. In the Office of National Statistics Survey 2000 (1), a degree of limiting fatigue was reported by 27% of working-age adults. Although it is claimed that about three-quarters of these patients in primary care go on to develop chronic symptoms, this is at odds with the reported point prevalence of only up to 3%. The vast majority of this fatigue falls within the 'medically unexplained' (2) category yet does not meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Even those that might do are often not diagnosed as such by physicans (3). As Ranjith ((4), this issue) demon- strates, there are several sets of different diagnostic criteria that make this difficult area even more complex. A primary agreement seems to be the requirement for the fatigue to have lasted for 6 months or more and to be associated with a substantial degree of impairment. It is this impairment that is the primary reason for occu- pational health involvement. Further symptoms must co- occur with the fatigue over the 6 month period (impaired memory or concentration, sore throat, tender glands, aching or stiff muscles, post-exertional fatigue, multi-joint pain, unrefreshing sleep and new headaches), although the actual number required fluctuates. Other clinically important physical causes preclude diagnosis, as do underlying serious psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. The common co-morbidity with anxiety and depression does not rule out the diagnosis and has complicated research, treatment and policy. A lot of published work covers either less severe conditions or those with shorter duration. These con- ditions receive labels such as 'chronic-fatigue like syndrome' or 'idiopathic chronic fatigue'.

      "title": "Resiliencia y salud mental en mayores. Validación de la escala de resiliencia cd-risc",
      "abstract": "La resiliencia es considerada un factor importante de salud mental, ha sido relacionada con autoeficacia, locus de control interno, emociones positivas y apoyo social fundamentalmente, ademas de otros aspectos como esperanza, espiritualidad, sentido trascendente de la propia vida, compromiso, control y desafio. Algunos estudios establecen que las personas mas resilientes tienen mayor capacidad de afrontamiento, presentan conductas proactivas de anticipacion y de logro de metas, utilizan mejor los servicios sociosanitarios y manifiestan menor dependencia y depresion. La NANDA Internacional ha aprobado recientemente tres diagnosticos de enfermeria relacionados con resiliencia que situan este concepto dentro del campo competencial enfermero. Los mayores son una poblacion ideal para estudiar la resiliencia, no solo por la gran cantidad de estados de estres y la acumulacion de experiencias de adversidad que presentan sino tambien porque podemos intervenir precozmente para potenciar la resiliencia y tratar de prevenir los problemas asociados a la vejez como el aumento de la prevalencia de las enfermedades cronicas, la depresion, el deterioro cognitivo o sus secuelas de discapacidad funcional. En este sentido medir la resiliencia se hace pertinente ya que de este modo podremos obtener perfiles de resiliencia en personas mayores que nos permitan conocer si las personas mas resilientes son mas capaces de afrontar los acontecimientos adversos que las que no lo son, intervenir para potenciar la resiliencia, asi como realizar validaciones clinicas de las etiquetas diagnosticas. Esta tesis tuvo como objetivo evaluar las caracteristicas psicometricas de la version espanola del CD-RISC de 25 items y del CD-RISC de 10 items en una muestra de personas mayores no institucionalizadas y examinar si, ambas, mantenian la misma estructura factorial que muestra la escala original. Se realizo un estudio descriptivo trasversal multicentrico de validacion de dos escalas de medida, realizado en cinco zonas basicas de salud de la provincia de Cuenca. Se realizo un muestreo aleatorio sistematico, cumplieron los criterios de inclusion 500 mayores, entre 60 y 75 anos. Las mediciones se realizaron mediante: Variables sociodemograficas, cuestionario Pfeiffer, CD-RISC-25 y CD-RISC-10 (resiliencia), PSS (estres percibido), los componentes fisico y mental del SF-12 Mental Status, GDS (depresion geriatrica) y MOS (apoyo social). Se analizaron los datos mediante diversas medidas estadisticas: el numero de factores de ambas escalas se realizo mediante analisis factorial exploratorio y se probo su ajuste mediante analisis factorial confirmatorio. La validez convergente se realizo para probar si la media de las puntuaciones de las variables utilizadas se asociaron significativamente con resiliencia. La consistencia interna de los items se realizo mediante el alfa de Cronbach que fue de 0.87 y de 0.81 respectivamente en ambas escalas. Las puntuaciones globales de la version en espanola del CD-RISC-25 y CD-RISC-10 correlacionaron directamente con el cuestionario de apoyo social (MOS) y los componentes fisico y mental del SF-12, e inversamente con las de estres percibido (PSS) y depresion geriatrica (GDS). Las mujeres con bajas puntuaciones en resiliencia tuvieron peores puntuaciones en los niveles fisico y mental del SF-12. Como conclusion obtuvimos dos versiones en espanol del CD-RISC una con 17 items en tres dimensiones y la otra con 10 items en una sola dimension. Las dos versiones en espanol mostraron buenas propiedades psicometricas, por lo tanto pueden ser utilizadas como dos instrumentos validos y fiables para medir la resiliencia en la poblacion de mayores no institucionalizados.",

The long-term effects of exposure to powerful and traumatic situations, contexts, and structures mean that prisons themselves can bring about psychological problems resulting from prison trauma. Interviewed lifers described symptoms that were not limited to PTSD, but also included institutionalized personality traits (prisonization), social-sensory disorientation, and temporal alienation, or the idea of ‘not belonging’. Taken together, this cluster of mental health symptoms is described as the ‘Post-Incarceration Syndrome’, or PICS.

      "title": "Burnout and its impact on Nurses and Doctors",
      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "title": "A glossary on psychiatric epidemiology",
      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology constitutes an important subdiscipline of scientific psychiatry. Nevertheless, it still lags behind other branches of epidemiology. This has been attributed to the difficulties encountered in conceptualising and measuring mental disorders.1 It is only recently that the emphasis in the field has shifted from descriptive to analytical research and this is probably because of the influences from genetic epidemiology and social sciences.2 Psychiatric epidemiology has taken most of its tools from general epidemiology—that is, chronic disease epidemiology.3 It is therefore not surprising that no fundamental differences between the mother discipline and her psychiatric descendant exist. Yet, there are particular challenges in the conduct of psychiatric epidemiological research that are absent or less prominent in general, mostly somatically oriented, epidemiology.4 Challenges particularly encountered in psychiatric epidemiology include\n\n\n\n1. Assessment of caseness: psychiatric diagnoses are mostly made on the basis of symptoms—patients’ reports of their subjective experiences—and not signs, like fever in general medicine. Moreover, there are no pathognomonic symptoms or signs;\n\n2. Neither most mental disorders nor their best-known risk factors, like social deprivation, stress exposure, lack of social support, social isolation, abnormal personality traits or genetic liability, are as easily captured in a singular variable as tends to be the case in the epidemiology of somatic disease;\n\n3. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is costly in time and effort; and\n\n4. Information bias and non-response bias are more of a problem in psychiatric epidemiology than in other branches of epidemiology.\n\n\n\nIn our view, this warrants recognition of the epidemiology subspecialty “psychiatric epidemiology”.\n\nIn trying to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, psychiatric epidemiology has developed a set of concepts, albeit limited, and vocabulary of its own. The purpose of this glossary is to provide brief definitions, sometimes with comments, of frequently used special terms one may come across in dealing with …",

Originally, as ‘adjustment reaction’, it was one of a very few disorder categories included in major psychiatric classification schemes specifically for use in children and adolescents. In DSM-I, for instance, adjustment reaction and childhood schizophrenia were the only two categories of childhood psychiatric disorder. The intention was to indicate that some instances of disordered behaviour or emotions arose specifically because of an identified stressor rather than, say, a process of mental illness. The source of stress was originally thought of as including both external events (such as bereavement) or an internal developmental process, which might require significant adaptation of mental functioning (such as maturational changes during adolescence). There was an implicit idea that adjustment to adversity or intra-psychic conflict could be either adaptive or maladaptive. If it was maladaptive, then personal dysfunction was to be seen as a psychiatric condition.",

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

There are different kinds of trauma or stresses. There are some that are cause by natural disaster, some by warfare trauma, violence on civilians, sexual assault, physical assault, psychological assault and others. PTSD was first described on soldiers who participated in the American civil war. Mental problems in soldiers which took part in the First World War, experts of that era considered functional and labeled the term grenade shock. Upon completion of the Second World War, the observed psychological disturbances of war participants were termed uncommon acute PTSDs occur within 3 months of the traumatic event, and chronic PTSD occurs after 3 or more months and in the postponed PTSD the symptoms occur 6 months after the traumatic event. Treatment of PTSD involves biological, social and psychological therapy. One that stands the most in these types of psychological disorder is psychological one. There are different approaches for it, it can be run as an individual conversation with a psychiatrist or in a way of group therapies that indicates larger progress in behavior of people in everyday life. There are different kinds of diagnosis analysis that can be done for this type of disorders. International classification MKB-10 is primarily used for classification of sickens and cause of deaths, while DSM-V is used for diagnosis of mental disorder behavior, and it is used on global scale. Advantage of specific group therapy primarily depends on the fact that individual has a chance to verbalize feelings without the fear of being judge, without the fear of non-acceptance. With that kind of activity, the progress of the emotional state of the person in hand, comes progress. With an individual progress there is a possibility that all members of the group learn about there own patterns of that behavior, and that they can see there reactions which are going to be positive or negative. Group psychotherapy is a method that uses group members to give feedback to the individual about his behavior and his emotional state. The advantage and specificity of this type of therapy is most in the sense that an individual has the opportunity to verbalize his feelings without fear of condemnation, prejudice and disapproval. The role of a nurse on people who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder is very broad in scope. Starting from communication skills to more complex beginnings of sister care for such patients. There is a great deal of empathy, knowledge and patience for such work. The nurses have first contact with the patient and are carrying it 24 hours a day. The nurse takes data for the sister's history by talking to family members and the patient himself. A nurse is a member of a therapeutic team and has to know the psychic disorder and recognize the patient's needs that the health care aspect can accomplish.",

Management involves accurate diagnosis and treatment of medical illness, practical interventions to resolve concurrent family, social and economic stressors, and emotional support. Cognitive, behavioral and brief psychodynamic therapies may be helpful in selected cases. Antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy have a role in the treatment of severe or persistent depression associated with suicidal behavior, marked psychomotor retardation, starvation or other life-threatening symptoms.

However, we do not know if inflammatory status predates onset of disease or whether it contributes to depression symptomatology. We report preexisting individual differences in the peripheral immune system that predict and promote stress susceptibility. Replacing a stress-naive animal’s peripheral immune system with that of a stressed animal increases susceptibility to social stress including repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) and witness defeat (a purely emotional form of social stress). Depleting the cytokine IL-6 from the whole body or just from leukocytes promotes resilience, as does sequestering IL-6 outside of the brain. These studies demonstrate that the emotional response to stress can be generated or blocked in the periphery, and offer a potential new form of treatment for stress disorders.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Following Intraoperative Awareness",
      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric emergencies are changes in behavior that place the patient or others at risk and require immediate therapeutic intervention (within minutes or hours) to prevent harm. Representing extreme severity in mental illness, they are associated with feelings of fear, anger, prejudice and even exclusion. Professional and environmental aspects of the healthcare workplace can help perpetuate stereotypes and interfere with care quality. Stigma can lead to very negative consequences in patients with mental disorders. Certain measures can reduce stigma and provide a more dignified way for patients to recover from the crisis. This article aims to discuss the causes of stigma, ways of dealing with it, and achievements that have been made in psychiatric emergency care settings.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Illness behavior refers to the ways in which symptoms are perceived, understood, acted upon, and communicated and include facial grimacing, holding or supporting the affected body part, limping, using a cane, and stooping while walking. Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders. They often present with symptoms of oppositional/defiant \nbehavior, anger outbursts, severe mood disturbance, anxiety, self-injurious behaviors, \nsubstance abuse, and poor social skills.

The usual environmental and psychological factors that influence maturation are modified by the attitudes of other persons toward the disabled one and by his own attitudes toward his defects and the limitations which they impose upon him. During the first few formative years, the normal child develops increasing physical independence as his motility and equilibrium patterns mature, enabling him to erect himself against gravity and to locomote independently. This growing capability is paralleled by the ego development and the appreciation of body image concept. The development of speech is a major step in communication and greatly facilitates the child's contact with his environment. The alteration of these patterns of maturation by central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders may influence profoundly the individual's personality. This results from the anxiety",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) now sits within the newly created “Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders” section of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition; DSM-5). Through the refinement and expansion of diagnostic criteria, the DSM-5 version better clarifies the broad and pervasive effects of trauma on functioning, as well as the impact of development on trauma reactions. Aggressive and dissociative symptoms are more thoroughly characterized, reflecting increasing evidence that reactions to trauma often reach beyond the domains of fear and anxiety (these latter domains were emphasized in DSM-IV). These revised criteria are supported by decades of preclinical and clinical research quantifying traumatic stress–induced changes in neurobiological and behavioral function. Several features of the DSM-5 PTSD criteria are similarly and consistently represented in preclinical animal models and humans following exposure to extreme stress. In rodent models, for example, increases in anxiety-like, helplessness, or aggressive behavior, along with disruptions in circadian/neurovegetative function, are typically induced by severe, inescapable, and uncontrollable stress. These abnormalities are prominent features of PTSD and can help us in understanding the pathophysiology of this and other stress-associated psychiatric disorders. In this article we examine some of the changes to the diagnostic criteria of PTSD in the context of trauma-related neurobiological dysfunction, and discuss implications for how preclinical data can be useful in current and future clinical conceptualizations of trauma and trauma-related psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The first part of this two-part series discusses psychological influences in delayed and failed recovery and resulting unnecessary work disability; the second part discusses theoretical and practical aspects of the issue, including evaluation and treatment. Delayed and failed recovery and unnecessary disability (DFRUD) refers to a lag in, or lack of, expected recovery from a medical condition and/or unnecessary resultant disability. Causation is complex, and we are not doing well at managing this group of workers using a biomedical model. The traditional biomedical model posits that disease or injury produces symptoms and signs that cause impairment and result in disability. This approach too strictly separates mental phenomena and bodily function (Cartesian dualism) and leads to scientific reductionism when actually six domains are active in worker disability: medical, personal, psychological, sociocultural, systematic (including compensation and insurance), and workplace elements. Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) should be understood as a disturbance of normal neurological and/or psychological processes underlying symptom production, perception, and experience and cannot be better explained by another physical or psychiatric illness. Within this system of evaluation, administrative and medical iatrogenicity are associated with unnecessary medical care and poor outcomes for individuals. In addition to determining industrial causality and apportionment, if evaluators accept some psychological factors, MUPS, and central sensitization, they must explain to what extent these are compensable. Part two of this article will discuss theoretical and practical approaches, including specific evaluation and treatment methods.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

People with PTSD experience one or more major symptoms that include flashbacks and paranoia, difficulty in interpersonal relationships, and problems engaging in work and activities of daily living. In severe cases they can harm themselves or the others; but these events are preventable by appropriate therapies. PTSD is a well-characterized serious psychological and behavioural abnormality that occurs after exposure to one or more acute severe stressful events.

These disorders arise at the intersection of lesion-related brain dysfunction and psychological distress related to the event and its aftermath, making it difficult to identify what symptom is a direct physiological consequence of the stroke. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, apathy, emotionalism, and anger are the most common of these syndromes, and posttraumatic stress disorder related to the stroke event has become increasingly recognized as a relevant entity. Mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis are less commonly encountered but potentially highly debilitating conditions that may be underrecognized. Early identification and treatment may mitigate functional impairment and improve quality of life. Evidence-based guidelines from the general population are often relied upon to guide treatment. Further research is needed to understand and tailor treatment of these disorders in the poststroke population.",

      "abstract": "Many refugees in the developed world are survivors of torture and present with health needs without their traumatic experience being disclosed or identified. Chronic pain is a common problem, as are symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and other distress. Current circumstances, particularly poverty, uncertainty about asylum, separation from or loss of family and roles, and difficulties settling in the host country, all contribute to current psychological problems and exacerbate existing ones. Psychological treatment studies tend to be focused either on PTSD diagnosis and use protocol-driven treatment, usually in the developed world, or on multiple problems using multimodal treatment including advocacy and welfare interventions, usually in the developing world. Reviews of both of these, and some of the major criticisms, are described. Psychological interventions tend to produce medium-sized changes in targeted measures of distress, when compared with waiting lists or standard treatment, but these may fall well short of enabling recovery, and long-term follow-up is rare. A human rights context, with reference to cultural difference in expressing distress and seeking help, and with reference to the personal meaning of torture, is essential as a basis for formulating treatment initiatives based on the evidence reviewed.Refugees with a history of torture may have a wide range of psychological and social difficulties which do not easily fit within diagnostic categories.Torture and its sequelae can have multiple meanings and, in the clinical context, it is the interpretation of the torture survivor that matters.There are doubts about applying the concept and measures of post-traumatic stress disorder: symptoms should be assessed separately.Current circumstances can be as important as trauma history in understanding the psychological state of a torture survivor.Cognitive behavioural therapy and narrative exposure therapy seem equally effective in reducing trauma symptoms, and to a lesser extent, depression.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that persists or recurs more than three months and may extend beyond the expected time of healing. Recently nociplastic pain has been introduced as a descriptor of mechanism of pain, which is due to disturbance of neural processing without actual or potential tissue damage, appearing to replace a concept of psychogenic pain. An interdisciplinary task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) compiled a systematic classification of clinical conditions associated with chronic pain, which was published in 2018 and will officially come into effect in 2022 in the 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization. ICD-11 offers the option for recording the presence of psychological or social factors in chronic pain; however, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions in the pathogenesis of chronic pain are missing. Earlier pain disorder was defined as a condition with chronic pain associated with psychological factors, but it was replaced with somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) in 2013. Recently clinical nosology is trending toward highlighting neurological pathology of chronic pain, discounting psychological or social factors in the pathogenesis of pain. This review article discusses components of the pain pathway, the component-based mechanisms of pain, central and peripheral sensitization, roles of chronic inflammation, and the involvement of tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolites, exploring participations of psychosocial and behavioral factors in central sensitization of diseases progressing into development of chronic pain, comorbid diseases that commonly present a symptom of chronic pain, and psychiatric disorders that manifest chronic pain without obvious actual or potential tissue damage.",

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "title": "Is treatment resistant depression a different subtype of depression?",
      "abstract": "Major depression is a serious, disabling, often chronic or recurrent mental disorder affecting over 350 million people worldwide. Treatment of major depression is now conceptualized as proceeding through three phases: the acute phase, the continuation phase, and the remission phase. Patients not achieving remission after several treatment trials are defined treatment-resistant, but a debate is ongoing regarding how many trials must fail before a patient can be defined as “treatment-resistant”. It must be acknowledged that depression is a heterogeneous disease, and several personal, socio-cultural and clinical factors should be taken into account in order to develop a personalized management plan for patients with major depression. A new concept of “difficult to treat depression” has been recently proposed. According to this concept, when a complete control of the disorder is not feasible, the treatment should aim at minimizing the impact of symptoms and the side effects of treatments on patients’ daily lives. Moreover, the concept of difficult to treat depression includes the presence of co-occurring problems/ behaviours/ disorders/ situations, which can worsen the course or management of depression. The management of patients with treatment resistant depression includes the optimization of disease management, in terms of symptom control, improvement of daily functioning and of quality of life. However, an approach aiming to personalize treatment of patients with major depressive disorder and focused on the specific clinical features of each patient can be valuable for optimizing the treatment of patients with resistant depression.

      "abstract": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is the most common type of status epilepticus and carries the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality (1). It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

      "abstract": "Three sets of clinical boundaries exist for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as for all concepts of psychiatric disorder. The first involves the border with normal psychology in general, and with the normal psychology of stress response in particular. This boundary can be surveyed from a number of vantage points and the maps which result will not necessarily correspond. The second boundary issue involves internal boundaries between psychiatric disorders, specifically between PTSD and other concepts of disorder. The high level of comorbidity documented in PTSD has ensured that this aspect of boundary setting is particularly contentious. The third set of boundaries is concerned with subtyping within the global construct of PTSD. The validity and extent of subtyping would be based on the degree to which phenomenological differences exist in relation to PTSD syndromes occurring in the wake of certain types of traumatic events. Such clinical subtyping might however need to be buttressed by external validity indicators such as differential treatment responses or outcome. A final boundary issue of major significance to therapists involves the need to place oneself unambiguously on the side of the trauma survivor in the struggle to resolve the traumatic experiences. The pivotal position of PTSD in the psychopathological arena is discussed.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

      "title": "Estrés diario y calidad de vida en las personas con lesión medular espinal",
      "abstract": "La Lesion Medular Espinal (LME) refiere a un suceso vital mayor que provoca importantes y permanentes cambios. Consiste en un cese de la senal neuronal que oca-siona una restriccion de las funciones motoras, sensitivas y vegetativas por debajo de la lesion. Una LME afecta gravemente a las funciones y capacidades de la persona. El estres diario puede entenderse como de¬mandas coti¬dianas y frus¬trantes que condicionan la interac¬cion del sujeto con el medio. Se ha encontrado que un aumento en la percepcion de contrariedades predice un empeoramiento de la sintomatologia psicologica y somatica. Las personas con una LME se en¬frentan a un amplio conjunto de situa¬ciones estresantes novedo¬sas. La calidad de vida (CV) es un constructo complejo y aun no se ha alcanzado un acuerdo general en su definicion. Puede interpretarse como un estilo personal cuyas caracteristicas serian encontrar un equilibrio entre expectativas, esperanzas y realida-des conseguidas o asequibles. Los objetivos principales de esta tesis fueron el desarrollo y validacion de una es-cala de me¬dida del estres diario en la LME, por un lado, y la medida y valoracion de la CV en la poblacion de lesionados medulares, asi como por que variables resulta mas influenciada, por otro. Para cubrir el primer objetivo, desarrollamos la Escala de Estres Diario para la Lesion Medular Espinal (EED–LME–26). Resulta importante puesto que en la actuali-dad no existe ninguna herra¬mienta para este proposito en esta poblacion. Para su crea-cion se utilizo una muestra de 105 sujetos. Se realizo un analisis factorial exploratorio obteniendose 9 dimensiones del estres. Posteriormente, aplicando analisis factorial confirmatorio validamos 8 de las 9 dimensiones anteriores. La validez concurrente de la escala se com¬probo a traves de correla¬ciones con otras medidas del estres psicoso-cial, mostrando que nuestra escala es adecuada para la evaluacion del estres diario en la LME. Para estimar la CV en la LME, se valoro el impacto de diversos indicadores obje-tivos, variables sociodemograficas, y psicosociales asi como la relacion de CV con la salud subjetiva. A tal fin, se llevo a cabo un analisis de regresion multiple hacia ade-lante. Su resultado mostro que la CV en los participantes de nuestra muestra se asocia negativamente con la gravedad de la LME, con una peor salud fisica, y con un incre-mento en la variable “consumo de analgesicos”. Y hubo una correlacion positiva con un nivel alto de hardiness, apoyo social, y vivienda adaptada. Consideramos que la EED–LME–26 sera un instru¬mento que pueda utilizarse en investigacio¬nes sobre la influencia del estres diario en lesionados medulares. Tambien podra servir al personal sani¬tario, psicolo¬gico y psiquia¬trico de cara a obtener infor-macion util y rele¬vante para la terapia con la LME y tratar trastornos psicologicos colaterales a la LME. En relacion con nuestro estudio de la CV en personas con una LME, se han proporcionado datos de interes tanto desde una perspectiva orientada a la salud, como, tambien, para colaborar con las distintas asociaciones de lesionados medulares y dis-capacitados, de manera que estas puedan emplearlos como un instrumento de sensibi-lizacion de los organismos oficiales. Adicionalmente, tanto la EED–LME–26 como las conclusiones derivadas de nuestra evaluacion de la CV en personas con una LME, podran resultar utiles de cara a actuar en lesionados medulares que no logran adaptarse a su nuevo entorno, que han perdido su trabajo y el panorama laboral no es propicio. Asimismo, resulta importante para establecer una optima relacion social y/o familiar. Logicamente tambien es im-portante que la sociedad asimile a los lesionados medulares como personas validas y capacitadas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "abstract": "Depression includes a wide range of symptoms that can impair a person's psychosocial and physical functioning. This impairment can lead to decreased productivity, increased health care utilization, alcohol and substance abuse, and an increased risk of suicide. While the treatment of depression has significantly advanced over the past 30 years, there is still room for improvement. Full remission of depressive symptoms is often elusive, and many patients never achieve full relief from their depression despite being regarded as responders to antidepressant treatment. Current treatments for depression tend to focus on emotional symptoms, not the physical and anxious symptoms also associated with depression. However, the physical and anxious symptoms of depression can be serious and sometimes more prominent than the emotional symptoms of depression, especially among special populations such as women. New treatment strategies, such as dual-acting agents and the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, target the emotional and anxious symptoms of depression as well as symptoms associated with pain. In order to increase response and remission, depression should be seen as an illness comprising not only emotional symptoms but physical and anxious symptoms as well.",

      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

Probably because of methodological difficulties inherent in assessing this complex phenomenon, even the most commonly assessed outcome variables have produced contradictory results, with the exception of leaving or desiring to leave the psychologically abusive relationship. Some of the significant findings require more corroboration due to the small number of studies addressing them. The relative role of physical abuse in relation to psychological abuse has yet to be disentangled. Mediator/moderator variables are likely extremely important for explaining why particular consequences do not consistently result from psychological aggression.

      "abstract": "It has long been observed that traumatic experiences are often followed by a distinct pattern of distressing symptoms. Accounts of such reactions began to appear in the psychiatric literature with greater frequency after the Second World War, resulting in the inclusion of “gross stress reaction” in the first version of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-I) in 1952. Although the DSM-I noted that exposure to extreme stress may trigger great psychological distress, it did not provide diagnostic criteria for the stress reaction. It was not until the third revision of the DSM(DSM-III; APA, 1980) that mental health experts first codified the pattern of posttrauma reactions as a distinct anxiety disorder, termed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and offered clear and specific diagnostic criteria.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Domestic violence and abuse through a psychological lens",
      "abstract": "Seeing domestic violence and abuse through a psychological lens can entail considering violence as a trauma and being concerned with its potential effect on mental health. As a traumatic event, domestic violence can be described as severe. It commonly persists over time, contains multiple types of violence, and takes place within a significant relationship, which may limit the possibility to escape and involve betrayal. Mental health consequences of domestic violence can be severe and complex, sometimes including symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or substance abuse disorders. For children, an additional problem is that domestic violence may interfere with their development and attachment. Cross-cultural research may elucidate the role of culture in domestic violence prevalence, mental health risk and coping. Not all survivors struggle with symptoms of mental health problems, and certain risk and protective factors may increase or decrease the risk. One potent risk factor for mental health problems is shame. As a social emotion, shame relates to negative beliefs and assumptions about violence and victims held by their social surroundings. Shame is thus not only a characteristic of the individual victim, but also of her/his social group, and society at large. The severity of potential mental health problems after experiences with violence means that many survivors may need psychological treatment. Various trauma-treatment models are effective in reducing symptoms. However, treatment is not available for all. New innovations, including online modules, show promise in making treatment more available for victims.",

While presentation of late-onset, post-service difficulties may explain some of the difference between veterans and those in service, delayed-onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to be partly explained by prior subthreshold PTSD, as well as other mental health difficulties. In the longer term, veterans do not appear to suffer worse mental health than equivalent civilians. This overall lack of difference, despite increased mental health difficulties in those who have recently left, suggests that veterans are not at risk of worse mental health and/or that poor mental health is a cause, rather than a consequence, of leaving service.",

Anxiety is the complex blend of unpleasant emotions and cognitions that is both more oriented to the future and much more diffuse than fear (2).Anxiety has not only cognitive components but also physiological and behavioural components. At the cognitive level anxiety involves negative mood worry about the possible future, threat or danger, self-preoccupation and future threat and to control it if it occurs. At the physiological level anxiety often creates a state of tension and chronic over arousal which may affect readiness for delaying with danger. At behavioural level anxiety may create a strong tendency to avoid situations where danger might encounter but there is not the immediate urge to flee with anxiety as there is with fear (3). An increased risk of muscular skeletal disorder was found in workers with pre-existing anxiety and depression compared to the without them (4).",

Successful maintenance of homeostasis leads to the state of eustasis, which represents health. The prolonged, excessive, or deficient response of the stress system to stress, however, may lead to a state of dyshomeostasis or cacostasis, which may lead to physical and mental health problems. Although research has focused on the detrimental effects of stress, only a few studies have been done on positive stress exposure adaptations. Increased resilience, post-traumatic psychological growth, and increased empathy may benefit chronically stressed individuals, enhancing their abilities to cope with distress. Therapeutic efforts in the treatment of short- or long-term stress aims at reducing its effect on neuroendocrine responses, behaviour changes, and so on. Community investments and interventions should focus on reducing threats and promoting positive adaptation during and after traumatic stress exposures.",

J, age 19, is a Division I collegiate volleyball player who recently sustained her third sport-related concussion (SRC).She has no psychiatric history but does have a history of migraine, and her headaches have worsened since the most recent SRC.She has a family history of depression (mother and her sole sibling).Ms. J recently experienced the loss of her coach, someone she greatly admired, in a motor vehicle accident.She is referred to outpatient psychiatry for assessment of mood symptoms that are persisting 1 month after the SRC.Upon assessment, she is found to meet 8 of the 9 criteria for a major depressive episode, including suicidality with vague plans but no intent to end her life.Although Ms. J does not have a history of psychiatric illness, her psychiatrist recognizes that she has factors that increase her risk of developing depression post-SRC, and of poor recovery from SRC.These include preexisting symptoms, such as her history of migraine, which is common in patients after SRC.Additionally, a family history of psychiatric disorders and high life stressors (eg, recent loss of her coach) are risk factors for a poor SRC recovery. 1Due to these risk factors and the severity of Ms. J's symptoms-which include suicidal ideation-the psychiatrist believes that her depressive symptoms might be unlikely to improve in the coming weeks, so he establishes a diagnosis of \"depressive disorder due to another medical condition (concussion)\" because the development of her depressive symptoms coincided with the SRC.If Ms. J had a pre-existing mood disorder, or if her depression had not developed until later in the postinjury period, it would have been more difficult to establish confidently that the depressive episode was a direct physiologic consequence of the SRC; if that had been the case, the diagnosis probably would have been unspecified or other specified depressive disorder.",

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "title": "A Behaviorist Perspective",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a sensory experience that produces suffering and functional impairment and is the result of both sensory input as well as secondary adaptation of the nervous system. The sensitization of the nervous system to pain is influenced by physical activity (or inactivity) and medication exposure. Medication taking and physical activity are behaviors that are increased or decreased by positive and negative reinforcement. Patients often have comorbid psychiatric conditions at presentation, including addictions, mood disorders, personality vulnerabilities and life circumstances that amplify their disability and impede their recovery. Behavioral conditioning contributes to chronic pain disorders in the form of both classical (Pavlov) and operant (Skinner) conditioning that increases the experience of pain, the liability to ongoing injury, the central amplification of pain, the use of reinforcing medications such as opiates and benzodiazepines, and behaviors associated with disability. The term 'abnormal illness behavior' has been used to describe behaviors that are associated with illness but are not explained physiologically. Behavioral conditioning often amplifies these abnormal behaviors in patients with chronic pain. Addiction can also be seen as a behavior that is reinforced and conditioned. The same factors that amplify abnormal illness behaviors also increase the liability to addiction. Psychiatric comorbidities also complicate and amplify abnormal illness behaviors and addictive behaviors and further contribute to the disability of chronic pain patients. Model interventions that reinforce healthy behaviors and extinguish illness behaviors are effective in patients with addictions and chronic pain. Maladaptive behaviors including addictive behaviors can be used as targets for classical and operant conditioning techniques, and these techniques are demonstrably effective in patients with chronic pain and addictions.",

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

The considerable overlapping of symptoms is not considered at all, nor is concussion given a diagnosis. Some anatomical and physiological considerations for these frequently comorbid conditions are specified to increase diagnostic precision, or call attention to unavoidable ambiguities. The current definitions lead to diagnostic error since there are many that are based upon symptoms that are not trauma related although they resemble those of TBI. A Taxonomy of Neurobehavioral Disorders draws attention to a wide range of physiological and behavioral functions, with implications for more accurate recognition of symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Persistent posttraumatic disorders, more complex than PTSD, exist, due to the effects of unhealed tissues, impairment, and the social consequences of impairment and rejection. There are recommendations for the improvement of the definitions of PTSD and traumatic brain injury when both may be co-morbid after a mechanical injury.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic illness that is defined and diagnosed by its symptoms: extreme fatigue made worse by physical and mental activity, pain and decreased mental stamina, among others. A long-held, erroneous belief that ME/CFS is not a physiological illness has persisted among some clinicians, leading to the denial of a patient's physical illness and attributing the symptoms to other causes. The debilitating effects of ME/CFS in the pediatric population can affect all aspects of academic, social, emotional, and physical development. ME/CFS has been diagnosed in children younger than 10 years. Therefore, the school nurse is likely to encounter one or more students in the various stages of this disease, putting the school nurse in a position to ameliorate the impact of this potentially devastating chronic condition.",

      "abstract": "Depressive illness is protean in its manifestations. The symptoms may be primarily psychological, such as misery, indecisiveness, irritability, inability to concentrate, or insomnia. They may be mainly physical, and the patient may present with one or more of a bewildering number of somatic complaints, often blaming those for his change in mood (Watts, 1957). Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one. In spite of thorough investigation, there will remain a proportion of patients in whom no lesion can be found to account for their symptoms.",

      "title": "Impairment Tutorial: Personality Disorders in Disability Arena",
      "abstract": "Personality disorders are conditions that can complicate impairment and disability assessment. It is important that the evaluating physician recognize these disorders. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)1 defines ten specific personality disorders in addition to an eleventh condition, Personality Disorder NOS, which allows for combined features of the various personality disorders as well as personality conditions which are not specifically listed. The ten listed personality disorders are divided into three clusters.Personality disorders represent enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate markedly from those expected by the individual—s culture. These inflexible and pervasive patterns reflect problems with cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning and impulse control, and lead to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. By their very nature, personality disorders are often unrecognized by those who suffer from them, who tend to blame others for their problems. There may be comorbidity with various conditions, such as pain disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder and substance abuse. Personality disorders may be undiagnosed by healthcare providers, which can be particularly troublesome when disability benefits are involved.These personality disorders are occasionally present in people involved in litigation. Of this group, Paranoid Personality Disorder, in which a person suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploitative, harmful, or deceitful, is probably the most common in the legal arena. Such people tend to bear grudges, read hidden meaning into benign remarks, and to believe that their reputations are under attack. The other Cluster A personality disorders result in significant social detachment or isolation and are less likely to be present in plaintiffs or workers—compensation claimants.These personality disorders are more prevalent in the legal arena, perhaps because people suffering from these conditions feel comfortable with and may seek to be the focus of attention. Of this group, probably the most prevalent disorder in the legal disability arena is borderline personality. Such people may suffer from frantic efforts to avoid perceived abandonment, patterns of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, an identity disturbance, and impulsivity. They may exhibit suicidal behavior, gestures, and threats, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, intense displays of anger, transient dissociative symptoms, and stress-related paranoid ideation. Histrionic individuals have a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking behavior. Narcissistic individuals have a pattern of grandiosity, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Antisocial individuals have long-term disregard for the rights of others. In my experience, legal issues involving individuals with cluster B personality disorders often involve determination of causation of the person—s problems, an assessment of claims of harassment, and an assessment of the person—s fitness for employment.These disorders also are encountered in legal situations. Obsessive-compulsive personality disordered individuals who may have functioned at a high professional level, such as in the legal and medical professions, may be seeking disability benefits through private or group disability insurance plans. Dependent personality disordered patients encounter difficulty making everyday decisions; they tend to let others assume responsibility, have trouble with self-assertion, and have excessive need for nurturance and support. Such individuals—psychological need to be cared for perpetuates a disabled posture with respect to family and medical caregivers. These underlying issues tend to reinforce chronic pain syndromes and perpetuate claims for disability benefits, leading to potential diagnostic dilemmas concerning the cause of ongoing problems.The following case vignettes, which are composites of various case histories, help to illustrate these points.A thirty-five year old sawmill worker suffered a partial index and ring finger amputation in his non-dominant hand. He had suffered two prior significant accidents while working elsewhere in his twenties. In one of those accidents, he sustained a lumbar compression fracture when he fell from a platform; in the other, a mild traumatic brain injury when he was struck by falling pieces of lumber. After all of the injuries, there was a pattern of prolonged disability, chronic pain behavior, narcotics dependence, and increased explosive and threatening behavior.The injured worker gave a history of conflict with others since early adolescence. He had a history of mistrust, believing that others were cheating him and that his wife was unfaithful. Although greatly perturbed by his wife—s unsubstantiated infidelity, he was not at all concerned about the impact on his wife and children of his own infidelity. His accusations caused considerable turmoil at home. He had a long history of believing that he was being persecuted by his employers, family, police, neighbors, and acquaintances, lacking insight into the provocative nature of his own behavior. He thought that others tampered with his equipment at work and deliberately miscalculated his work output in order to cheat him, even though there was no supporting evidence. He had a history of recurrent fights, exacerbated by alcoholism and narcotics use, and of friction with the police.The evaluee suffered from Personality Disorder NOS with marked paranoid features, and this significantly colored his reaction to his traumatic amputation. His tendency to blame others for an accident that was due to his own misjudgment, his turbulent relationships at work, and his belief that he was being persecuted by the employer and coworkers severely impacted his ability to return to work and to be rehabilitated. His psychological problems were due to his underlying personality disorder, exacerbated by both substance abuse and the work injury. In the particular jurisdiction in which he was evaluated, the worsening of his psychological condition due to his work injury was deemed compensable by the workers—compensation hearing officer.A thirty-one year old woman was sexually harassed by a male supervisor in a factory where she was employed for seven months. The harassment began with occasional sexual comments, which at first seemed casual. When the remarks were not met with firm rejection, the supervisor escalated his behavior and made the employee feel very uncomfortable.At the time of the harassment, the employee was going through a divorce and a custody battle. Her husband, a cocaine dealer, had been released from prison one year previously. The evaluee had two prior failed marriages, both to jealous, abusive, controlling individuals. Her current husband seemed more interested in retribution for an affair that she had had when he was imprisoned than in working or providing for their two children.The employee had a long history of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships. She had a history since adolescence of mood swings with recurrent periods of anxiety, depression, and stress-related paranoid thinking. She had a pattern of self-abusive behavior, recurrently burning herself with matches and superficially cutting her forearms, abdomen, and legs with razor blades. The repetitive burning caused keloid formation on her forearms, which served to exacerbate her negative self-perception. She was perceived as flirtatious and often wore halter-tops and low-cut blouses to work, even in winter.The employee had a history of ongoing cocaine abuse and a past history of amphetamine addiction. She had a history of multiple failed relationships and impulsive behavior, but was socially engaging. She was perceived by others as a fun person when things were going well, but was quick to react with rage and feel abandoned. At such times, she contemplated suicide, and had a history of two brief psychiatric hospitalizations for overdoses. She had been in outpatient psychotherapy off and on since her teens, with four different therapists, and had been prescribed various benzodiazepines (which she abused) and antidepressants.In this case, the person—s psychological difficulties were due to a borderline personality disorder and substance abuse. The job-related sexual harassment was inappropriate and uncomfortable, but was not determined to be the cause of her psychological difficulties.",

Children with separation anxiety disorder (SAD) may experience a variety of behavioral and somatic symptoms upon separation from or in anticipation of separation from the attachment figure. Children with SAD experience intrusive worries that something might happen to the attachment figure or to child him-/herself. The core feature of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is excessive worrying related to number of events or activities that lasts for a period of six months or more. As with SAD, children with GAD have high rate of concurrent mental health disorders. Social anxiety disorder or social phobia is characterized by an excessive fear of negative evaluation by others. Often this extreme fear of judgment and evaluation is in situations with unfamiliar people or situations that could possibly result in scrutiny. Problem-solving methods are taught and practiced in order to help children identify new methods for addressing anxiety-provoking situations.",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

      "abstract": "• I reviewed studies examining the hypothesis that life events may precipitate a depressive disorder. Although some contradictory results exist, the majority of studies demonstrate that depressed patients experience more stressful events in the months that precede the onset of their disorder than do normal controls or schizophrenics. In calculating relative risk figures, it seems that depressive risk is increased by a factor of about 5 or 6 for the six months after an event. Certain events, such as undesirable, loss, or severely threatening events, are particularly likely to precede a depression. These results suggest that stressful events can bring about depressive episodes, but most of the evidence that supports this conclusion emanates from retrospective studies, and corroborating prospective studies are definitely needed. Furthermore, not all depressives report precipitating events, so other causal factors are also operative.",

In introduction, the author states methodological problems that accompany investigations of significance of traumatic events in onset, course and outcome of psychoses. The results of numerous studies have confirmed importance of those factors which can act even in pre and perinatal period, as well as in childhood (sexual and physical abuse) and later life period (growing in urban environment, migration, ethnicity, discrimination for sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap, appearance). Psychotic symptoms and stigma relating to mental disorder are also stressful for patients of this psychiatric population. 'Sensitization' refers to the process whereby (repeated) exposure to a certain event increases the behavioral and biological response to later exposure to a similar event, even if the later exposure is not as severe. Interaction of gene and environmental factors (biological synergism) and dysregulation of hypothalamus- pituitary-adrenal axis, the key mediator in response to stress is a mechanism responsible for the development of psychosis. The author also states the current dilemmas relating to classification and diagnosis of Acute and transient psychotic disorders (ICD-10), thy only form of psychoses which is the existence of psychosocial traumatic events in the period that precedes the development of symptoms, one of the necessary criterion for diagnosis.",

Unlike active abuse, which involves acts of direct violence, neglect operates by omission, often being more difficult to identify, having equally devastating psychological effects. According to attachment theory, the absence of parents supports the formation of an unstable cohesion, predisposing the child to difficulties in emotional regulation and increased reactivity to stress. The lack of a predictable and protected environment leads to emotional disorders, favoring the development of maladaptive beliefs about oneself and the world, amplifying the feeling of insecurity and constant fear of danger. On an emotional level, chronic neglect often generates a high level of toxic stress, being conceptualized as an attachment trauma or a complex relational trauma with cumulative effects.",

Naturally, chronic pain can present occasions when patients feel misunderstood or mistreated, feel threatened by poor health, experience interference with normal daily functioning, take medications that can produce side effects, and experience depression and anxiety. When chronic pain leads to painful emotions, memories, and other unwanted experiences, the pain sufferer will naturally attempt to avoid these as well. On the level of human experience, chronic pain brings loss, threats, uncertainty, restraint, apparent mistreatment, and failure into the lives of those who suffer with it. Chronic pain is possibly not best understood as a symptom or condition of the body that results in effects on the person and their functioning. The behavior of the individual pain sufferer, interacting with and in a broader psychological context, is an indivisible whole.",

The specific behavioral criteria for the diagnosis of conduct disorder can be conceptualized as either aggressive or nonaggressive in type (Table 1). Examples of aggressive behaviors are physical fighting and bullying, assault, vandalism, purse snatching, physical cruelty to persons or animals, breaking and entering, and arson. More serious aggressive behaviors are armed robbery, rape, and extortion. Nonaggressive behaviors of conduct disorder include substance abuse, persistent truancy, running away from home overnight, frequent lying in a variety of social settings, theft not involving a confrontation with a victim, and chronic violation of rules or the basic rights of others. Three subtypes of conduct disorder are identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition.1 These are descriptions of the functional contexts in which the particular behavior problems occur. The group type involves problematic behaviors that occur as part of an activity with peers.",

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

Delusional disorder is the least disabling of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and involves the presence of one or more delusions of at least one-month duration. Delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech that have a sudden onset and return to normal within a month are indicative of a brief psychotic disorder. Schizophreniform disorder is an intermediate diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder and schizophrenia. Another important distinction separates schizophreniform disorder from a diagnosis of schizophrenia—level of impairment. Symptoms of schizophrenia are the same as for schizophreniform disorder, except for the duration criteria, which must last at least 6 months. Schizoaffective disorder is one of the least understood disorders in DSM-5 . It includes symptoms of a mood disorder along with symptoms of a cognitive disorder, with the duration and severity of each being crucial for diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

The psychological traumatic and depressive stressors are the factors responsible for destroying the quality of life and affected the terminally ill individual in the most degrading ways. Alongside the physical pain symptoms, the terminal ill experience is always accompanied by several unwanted mental disharmonies and emotional sufferings like toxins, mood disorder, trauma, and low self-esteem. The higher level of stress and depression determines the growth of tumors and cancer metastasis rate in any terminal diagnosis. This makes the assessment of the psychological non-pain symptoms essential alongside the physical pain symptoms. Failing to acknowledge the patient's traumatic experience and depressive stressors will make the treatment unproductive and increase suicidal activities.",

      "title": "Young and exhausted",
      "abstract": "To the Editor,Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, multisystem and often debilitating disorder of unknown etiology. (1) It is a complicated disease characterized by at least six months (in pediatrics 3 months) of extreme fatigue that is not alleviated by rest and a group of other symptoms that are constant for a period of time. (1)Post-exertional malaise (PEM) and delayed recovery are core symptoms and the most useful when making a diagnosis. (2) PEM involves a constellation of substantially disabling signs and symptoms that occur in response to physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual over-exertion. (2) The diagnosis of CFS/ME relies on the typical clinical presentation and the exclusion of other causes of fatigue. Up until now there was no test to confirm the diagnosis of CFS/ME. The two-day cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is becoming a new diagnostic method that can be used in case of suspicion of CFS/ME in attempt to evaluate presence of PEM. (4) This test, used in centres for patients with CFS/ME, has not yet published any data in pediatrics to support its use.We present a case of a 13-year-old patient with chronic debilitating fatigue who meets the criteria for CFS/ME. The patient was examined in detail by a pediatrician (anamnestic unclear cause, resting tachycardia in the physical examination, laboratory tests within normal limits), endocrinologist (normal hormonal profile for a given age, Tanner stage 3), infectologist (serology for typical viruses negative), psychologist (normal cognitive functions). For a history of resting tachycardia, the patient was examined by a cardiologist where no cardiogenic cause of fatigue was demonstrated, sinus tachycardia was present, and the patient was recommended head-up-tilt test, which showed the presence of postural orthostatic tachycardia. Due to the idiopathic nature of the difficulties and the excluded secondary cause, a two-day protocol examination by cardiopulmonary exercise testing was indicated. Written consent was taken and documented. Before the examination, we performed resting spirometry (physiological findings), resting ECG (sinus tachycardia) and a shortened Schellong test with a tachycardic response to orthostasis immediately after standing up and after 3 minutes of standing. Subsequently, standard CPET using treadmill (Itam, Poland) with individualized protocol with progressive increase in workload until exhaustion and breath-by-breath analysis of exhaled gases (Geratherm, Germany) was performed. On the first day, basal values were determined, the patient subjectively tolerated the examination well, the exercise ended prematurely due to subjective fatigue and a feeling of lack of air. On the second day, under the same conditions, the CPET was repeated, during which the patient also terminated the exercise prematurely but a half minute later than on the first day (exercise duration 6:32 min vs. 7:00 min; peak work rate 3,26W/kg vs. 3,68W/kg; peak VO2 34,5 ml/kg/min vs. 36,5 ml/kg/min). Using this methodology, patient did not meet diagnostic criteria for PEM and subsequently CFS/ME (decrease in monitored values on the second day of the examinations). In both days, during exercise, a bizarre pattern of respiration with malposition of the respiratory act to the large airways was observed by observing the flow-volume loop. Analysis of the respiratory pattern identified an erratic respiratory pattern (figure 1A) with low resting ETCO2 (26mmHg) and tachypnoea at maximal workload with dominant ventilation of dead space (figure 1B, 1C, 1G). The consequence of this pattern of respiration is a chronic state of hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis, which is metabolically compensated in the patient. Fatigue and increased heart rate are expected clinical manifestations. Respiratory rehabilitation was recommended to the patient in order to fixate the correct breathing patterns (diaphragmatic breathing) and psychological guidance. The patient was subsequently retested 3 months after the start of physiotherapy and psychotherapy at the request of the parents. Retesting showed significant improvements in the monitored parameters (figure 1G) as well as in the clinical condition of the patient. The patient’s overall fitness increased, an adequate resting respiratory pattern was present (figure 1D), normal resting ETCO2 (36mmHg), ventilatory efficiency was adjusted (figure 1F, 1G), and the patient reported a subjective increase in energy. Prior to the examination, we performed a Schellong test on the patient, in which there were no signs of postural orthostatic tachycardia.Dysfunctional breathing (DB) is a condition of the airways characterized by an irregular breathing pattern and changes in the airways that cannot be attributed to a specific diagnosis and that causes respiratory and non-respiratory problems. (3) It is not a disease process, but rather changes in respiratory patterns that disrupt normal respiratory processes. However, DB can coexist with diseases such as bronchial asthma or heart disease. The main symptom is shortness of breath or air hunger, associated with non-respiratory symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, cervical spine pain or fatigue. (5) It also plays a role in chronic fatigue, neck and back pain, fibromyalgia, and some aspects of anxiety and depression. (5)The most common type of DB is hyperventilation syndrome, which is defined as respiration exceeding metabolic requirements, reducing blood carbon dioxide concentrations below normal values. (3) This changes the pH of the blood, increases the alkalinity and thus triggers a number of adaptive changes that cause symptoms. These conditions are non-somatic in nature and their treatment consists of respiratory rehabilitation by various techniques (diaphragmatic breathing, Feldenkrais method, Buteyko method, Pilates) and psychotherapy in order to control impulsive changes in the respiratory pattern in various situations. (5)CPET confirmed the presence of DB in the patient based on the low resting value of ETCO2, the presence of a chaotic pattern of respiration during resting and exercise with the presence of tachypnoea (with very low ventilatory efficiency) in maximal exertion. Diagnosis of DB using CPET is one of the methods of DB diagnostics. Proper respiratory rehabilitation and psychological guidance resulted in the patient fixing the respiratory pattern and subsequently eliminating the primary cause of the examination - chronic fatigue. Patients with CFS/ME are a common pediatric problem. The current possibilities of diagnostics are enriched by the possibility of performing CPET which can be a benefit in differential diagnostics as well as in confirming the diagnosis.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable.

Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and prolonged grief disorder may accompany ambiguous loss. No treatment guidelines are available on how to address these symptoms. We performed a literature review aimed at identifying empirically based treatment interventions applicable across a variety of settings. In relatives of missing persons with high levels of distress, holding on to hope that the loved one will return may be seen as a strategy to avoid emotions associated with the thought that the separation is permanent. However, pressure for closure paradoxically leads to increased resistance and may in the context of enforced disappearance serve politically repressive aims. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and prolonged grief may be addressed using empirically supported interventions, including psycho-education, mobilizing social support, exposure, and behavioral activation. Exposure-based interventions for ambiguous loss should not focus on closure or coming to terms with the irreversibility of the loss, but on tolerating the ambiguity surrounding the loss.",

Initial management consists of a short rest period followed by increasing activity that does not exacerbate symptoms. Cognitive modifications for school or work also are initiated early in the management plan. Use of other management modalities is based on findings from the physical examination. Imaging may be needed in cases of worsening or progressive symptoms. When athletes have returned to baseline symptom burden and have returned to school or work, they may transition to a return to play/sport progression. Most sports-related concussions resolve within 2 weeks for adults and 4 weeks for adolescents. Risk factors for prolonged recovery include initial high symptom burden, multiple concussions, young age, mental health issues, and migraine history.",

      "title": "Psychotic Symptoms in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Although many coexisting disorders have been reported with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), little reference has been made to the presence of psychotic symptoms. Psychotic symptoms are not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV or International Classification of Diseases 10 diagnoses of PTSD. The hallucinations and delusions described here in two cases of PTSD were accompanied by psychotic symptoms. These symptoms clearly differ from flashbacks but have a strong symbolic relationship to the trauma, and they do not respond to antipsychotic drugs. The question is whether there are two separate diagnoses or if psychotic symptoms are an integral part of PTSD. More systematic studies are required to explore the possibility of changing the current classifications of PTSD to include a diagnosis of PTSD with psychotic features.",

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "abstract": "Pre trial detention is a coercion measure where a suspect is incarcerated between the time he or she is being arrested until the trial. A pre trial detainee is considered innocent until proven guilty and thus it is important that the detention is not used as a punishment or rehabilitation. Whether a detainee is innocent or not he or she should be treated with respect for his or her human dignity. If there is a risk that a pre trial detainee will remove or effect evidence in the ongoing criminal investigation The court may allow the prosecutor to impose restrictions which limit the detainees contact with the outside world. Individual restrictions should be proportional to their means and used restrictively. \r\nExtensive use of such restrictions in combination with a long period of detention may lead to isolation of a detainee increasing the risk of anxiety, reduced cognitive abilities, sleeping difficulties and memory loss. Extended periods of isolation may even lead to serious mental illness such as personality changes and post traumatic stress disorder. Such isolation and its consequences has been compared to psychological torture. Another aspect of this matter is that a detainee who is experiencing mental illness may be disadvantaged when it comes to participating in interrogations, appearing in court or preparing his or her defence. \r\nThe Swedish pre trial detention system has been widely criticized due to an extensive use of restrictions, long detention times and the treatment of adolescents in custody. Nearly 50 % of all the detainees where subject to one or more types of restrictions and there are examples of detainees in Sweden that have been in pre trial detention with full restrictions up to three or four years. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) and the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (SPT) have visited Sweden eight times altogether since 1991. The purpose of the visits has been to evaluate the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty. The reports and recommendations following the visits have shown that there is a need for change for Sweden to better meet the mental health of detainees in pre trial detention.\r\nIn April 2015 the Swedish prosecutor general provided guidelines directed to Swedish prosecutors. The guidelines aim to change the procedure of imposing restrictions of detainees and to reduce the time they spend in pre trial detention. The subject of this thesis is the question of whether these guidelines will change the prevailing situation, or if they need to be supplemented by legislative measures. Among the proposals of what such legislative measures might look like are detailed regulation regarding the use of restrictions, established time limits for pre trial detention and isolation, and a procedure where the District Court Judge has a greater influence on the restrictions that are imposed. In my opinion, Swedish custody laws are in great need of change in order to make sure that the needs of the detainees and their mental health are respected.",

      "abstract": "Rats trained to discriminate between S(D) and S(Delta) for food reinforcement showed marked impairments in this discrimination when strong, unavoidable shocks occurred at the termination of a third stimulus. The predominant feature of this impairment was a supernormal rate of unreinforced (S(Delta)) behavior. Shocks delivered without exteroceptive warning also led to a discriminative breakdown. The effect was a direct function of shock intensity. When behavior was strongly suppressed in the third stimulus by response-correlated shock (\"punishment\"), instead of unavoidable shock, breakdowns were only temporary; as soon as responding recovered from its overall suppression, discriminative performance returned to normal. The discriminative deterioration may be interpreted as an emotional by-product of frequent aversive stimulation, but accidental contingencies could also have played a role.",

Pain was most frequent in patients with neurosis and personality disorder. The occurrence of pain was significantly associated with unskilled work, but was not related to experience of social stress. Patients with pain reported more anxiety and hostile feelings and had a higher degree of somatic anxiety and muscular tension, thus attaching importance to anxiety‐induced muscle spasm as a pain‐mediating mechanism. A specific relationship between pain and depression was not supported.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. III. An overview of assessment.",
      "abstract": "Assessment of animal well-being is a complex matter. It is difficult to establish a causal link between stimuli and internal state because of numerous variables and the time interval between cause and effect. Many studies document a correlation rather than a causal relationship among stimuli, responses, and subsequent health, disease, or mental state. Research objectives are often vague, the choice of assessment parameters is perplexing, and the results are difficult to interpret. In general, animal well-being cannot be assessed directly. There are no standardized methods or specific endpoints that provide an objective determination. Overt changes in physical and psychological functions occur only after the animal has experienced a prepathologic state. An animal's response to general arousal, life's events, and aversive stimuli depends on an integrated activation of various neural and endocrine factors. A variety of physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics change when an animal is exposed to aversive situations and stimuli, although many also change with the onset of positive general arousal, such as play, pleasant experiences, and sexual excitement. There is a need to evaluate numerous criteria (e.g., performance, clinical state, neurochemistry, endocrinology, immunology, morphology, behavior, and ethology) to compile a complete mental and biological profile of animals. The various systems, processes, and individual specific responses are interrelated and interact in a well-structured manner. Given the complexity of the topic and the disparate disciplines involved, developing a comprehensive understanding of animal well-being is not straightforward. Consequently, observers should be cautious. Foremost in any determination of animal well-being is assurance that criteria being used are relevant to well-being.",

Its conceptual and operational definitions vary widely. The broadcast definitions equate Burnout with stress, connect it with a long list of adverse health and well being variables and suggest that it is caused by relentless pursuit of success. Burnout has been related to human service professions with chronic inter-personal stress as its caused (Maslach and Jackson, 1981). It is conceived as a state of mental, physical and emotional exhaustion, typically occurring as a result of long-term involvement with people in situations, which are emotionally demanding. Burnout can be defined as the end result of stress experienced, but not properly coped with resulting in symptoms of exhaustion, irritation, ineffectiveness, discounting of self, others and problems of health (Hypertension, Ulcers and Heart Problems).",

Epidemiologic surveys have shown that these patients may display significant levels of functional impairment, have unexplained somatic symptoms and a high use of nonpsychiatric medical care, have long-lasting symptoms, and are at risk for more severe psychiatric disorders. A DSM-IV field trial concluded that patients with affective-symptoms not meeting thresholds for DSM-III-R disorders were at least as common as patients with anxiety or mood disorders, and that their symptoms were associated with significant distress or impairment. Although some of these patients present residual symptoms from previous psychiatric episodes and may request treatment specific to these conditions, it is not known if those without a psychiatric history could benefit from pharmacologic or psychological treatments usually used in mild outpatient cases.",

Nevertheless it is possible to draw the following conclusions out of the scientific papers and experiences of our own: A chronicity of depressive long-term courses is expected on old and higher age. Somatic diseases and organic brain syndrome render more difficult the amelioration and pharmacotherapy. The symptoms of affective disorders in old age most differ from depression in early and adult biographic phase. The course of dementias take off age and attendant somatic illness. In old age increase dementias. Their prognosis is worse. Added somatic process affects the further course negatively and renders more difficult the therapy. Long-term courses of dementias in old and higher age complicate the precise differential-diagnostic attach on pathogenetics. Social influences take effect on the course of depression and dementia advantageously or disadvantageously.",

A tic is a non-voluntary movement of the body or a vocal sound that can occur suddenly and is repeated, often rapidly. With appropriate sensitivity, the interviewer should physically demonstrate these tics when inquiring about their presence. If duration of motor tics is less than one year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Other Specified Tic Disorder or Unspecified Tic Disorder and skip to Vocal Tics. Symptoms must have persisted for at least one year, although they could wax and wane in frequency, and onset of symptoms must be prior to age 18. It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). If only motor tics or vocal tics are present and they occurred many times a day, for less than one year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Provisional Tic Disorder.",

Qui ne s’est jamais senti anxieux face la survenue d’un evenement important, qui ne s’est jamais plaint d’etre deprime certains jours maussades ? Pourtant, l’anxiete comme la depression peuvent donner lieu a des troubles psychiatriques majeurs, associes a d’importantes perturbations cognitives. Ces perturbations ont ete mises en evidence voici deja de nombreuses annees. La depression, en particulier, entraine chez le patient de reelles difficultes psycho-motrices, se manifestant notamment par un ralentissement general ainsi que des troubles mnesiques, attentionnels, et executifs. Ces alterations ont pu etre associees a differentes modifications du cerveau meme, attestant de bouleversements profonds de la structure cerebrale et des connexions neuronales, a la source ou consecutives a l’etat depressif. Outre ces perturbations que nous qualifierons de cognitives, des difficultes du traitement emotionnel ont egalement ete demontrees. Plus specifiquement, les patients depressifs semblent manifester un biais lorsqu’ils doivent analyser du materiel emotionnel. Ce biais est decrit comme un traitement affecte (dans le sens d’une facilitation ou au contraire d’un ralentissement) de tout contenu a valence emotionnel, comprenant par exemple des mots a valence emotionnelle (designant des emotions, des sentiments), des textes ou scenario, des scenes visuelles ou des visages. Dans ce chapitre, nous tenterons de synthetiser les principaux apports de la psychopathologie cognitive a l’etude de ces deux grands syndromes que sont la depression et les troubles anxieux. En nous centrant sur le theme des expressions faciales emotionnelles, nous passerons en revue les principales donnees comportementales obtenues a travers de paradigmes classiques, et nous montrerons comment les etudes utilisant l’imagerie ou l’electrophysiologie ont utilise ces paradigmes pour mettre en lumiere le fonctionnement cerebral des patients.",

We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

Studies have pointed to the growth in non-standard work and other changing work patterns as contributing to a recent sharp increase in stress leads in the workplace. In organizations the ergonomic the concern is work stress, which in any action from an external source that affects the body. This creates a strain in the body resulting in some physiological response to the stress. Work stress due to unusual posture or improper postural adjustment to the work results in back pain, headaches, nervousness, aching muscles, excessive perspiration and depressions. The most serious result of work stress is serious traumatic injuries, accumulative injuries or death. Psychological factors that may cause stress are excessive heat, improper furniture (chairs, tables etc.), poor workplace, long work hours or any other type of situation in which individual performs his or her work in unusual situation or in a continuous manner. Ill health results in high rate of absenteeism and turnover, industrial discontent and indiscipline, poor performance and low productivity and more accidents. Besides, employee’s health also provides other benefits such as improved morale of employees, increased productivity of employees and also longer working period of an employee which, of course cannot be easily measured.",

Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "For the purpose of this paper, the term disability will encompass the following impairments: disability that can increase vulnerability to abuse resulting from physical, sensory, or mental impairments, or a combination of impairments; physical disability resulting from injury (e.g., spinal cord injury, amputation), chronic disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), or congenital conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy); sensory impairments consisting of hearing or visual impairments; and mental impairments comprising developmental conditions (e.g., mental retardation), cognitive impairment (e.g., traumatic brain injury), or mental illness. Emotional abuse is being threatened, terrorized, severely rejected, isolated, ignored, or verbally attacked. Physical abuse is any form of violence against one’s body, such as being hit, kicked, restrained, or deprived of food or water. Sexual abuse is being forced, threatened, or deceived into sexual activities ranging from looking or touching to intercourse or rape.",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders are 3-4 times more frequent in individuals with intellectual disabilities than in those without. From a developmental perspective the reason for this high prevalence could be, besides biological aberrations, a personality development with a difference between cognitive and emotional developmental levels. This discrepancy renders the person being highly vulnerable for the onset of problem behaviour and psychiatric disorders. For a proper insight into processes which have led to the disorder, it is necessary to evaluate the level of emotional development. This can be determined by the \"schema of emotional development (SEO)\" developed by A. Dosen.By means of a case description the authors demonstrate the application of SEO in the assessment and utilization of the concept of the level of emotional development in clinical practice.The knowledge of the level of emotional development contributes to the explaining and understanding of the disorder, and also facilitates the establishment of an integrated diagnosis and the creation of appropriate integrated treatment strategies. Hence, temper tantrums, sleep patterns and mood improved in the case described.Besides biopsychosocial aspects, the developmental aspect, and in particular the level of emotional development should be taken into consideration in the diagnostic work-up and treatment of individuals with intellectual disabilities and mental health problems. The data generated by the SEO may help in understanding the disorder and developing a treatment approach for these individuals.",

A crucial question is whether stress is an epiphenomenon or a decisive factor in the causation of (certain forms of) mood disorder. Certainty about this question can only be obtained when it can be demonstrated that stress phenomena may induce changes in brain functioning similar to the ones supposedly associated with (certain forms of) depression. Since the phenomenology of stress syndromes, as well as their emotional intensity, are highly variable, careful diagnosis is a first requirement. In studies into the significance of stress in the occurrence of depression this degree of finesse has not been achieved. The major shortcomings are discussed. Those should be systematically addressed to provide this type of research with the necessary acuity.",

Considering that the anti-stress massage can help diminish chronic fatigue and depression, and as such, help prevent the emergence of the Karōshi syndrome, 16 sessions were applied on 4 subjects, over the course of 3 months. Their results, compared to the ones from other 4 subjects, proved that anti-stress massage has lead to a considerable diminished level of stress that generates chronic fatigue and depression.",

      "abstract": "To provide an update of the recent studies on the age of onset of the major mental illnesses, with a special focus on the prospects for prevention and early intervention.The studies reviewed here confirm previous reports on the age of onset of the major mental disorders. While the behaviour disorders, and certain anxiety disorders, emerge during childhood, most of the high prevalence disorders (anxiety, mood and substance use) emerge during adolescence and early adulthood, as do the psychotic disorders. Early age of onset has been shown to be associated with a longer duration of untreated illness and poorer clinical and functional outcomes.Although the onset of most mental disorders usually occurs during the first three decades of life, effective treatment is typically not initiated until a number of years later. Although there is increasing evidence to suggest that intervention during the early stages of a disorder may help reduce the severity and/or the persistence of the initial or primary disorder and prevent secondary disorders, additional research is needed into appropriate treatment for early stage cases as well as the long-term effects of early intervention, and to appropriate service design for those in the early stages of a mental illness. This will mean not only the strengthening and re-engineering of existing systems but also, crucially, the construction of new streams of care for young people in transition to adulthood.",

Ascribed and prescribed, mental illness diagnoses and experiences vary based on medicalized norms. Medicalization of mental illness occurs via three main authoritative professions: psychiatry, psychology, and clinical social work. The institution of medicine holds absolute authority over what is considered “natural” and “normal” in mental health and creates stigma. Disclosure has historically been discussed as a remedy but is limited according to social identities as well as determinants of health. Disclosure of mental illness as a disability can be problematic in workplaces. Experiences of sanism, or discrimination based on perceived level of sanity, are common.

The clinical manifestation of PTSD can occur a long time, even decades, after the initial traumatic experience. It may be triggered by associations (symbols of retraumatisation) and by other challenges to a state of psychosocial compensation that could only be attained by considerable mental effort.Psychotraumatic disturbances have their roots in a combination of three elements, which are the perception of threat, the inability to control such a threat and the consequence disruption of existential stability and expectancy. Although anxiety is supposedly an overwhelming sensation during such a threat, it is not always reported as such, afterwards; this may be related to peri-traumatic dissociation.",

      "title": "Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptom and related disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent physical symptoms or complaints that are associated with significant distress and impairment. The conceptualization of these disorders under the category of somatoform disorders in DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000) required that these somatic presentations lack objective organic causes. This latter requirement has been deleted in DSM-5, largely because somatic symptoms often do have related medical conditions (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Even when such associations have not been established, the assumption that they are present has often led to patients being labeled in pejorative ways, as if they are faking symptoms or somehow responsible for their own suffering. The seven disorders encompassed in the DSM-5 category of somatic symptom and related disorders are somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. DSM-IV disorders that are subsumed under this new nomenclature include somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and factitious disorders (which appeared in their own separate category in DSM-IV). Body dysmorphic disorder is not included in the new somatic symptom disorder category and is now classified as one of the other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Prevalence rates in the literature for what were previously labeled somatoform disorders varied by diagnosis, but in general and across ages these disorders have been seen in 16% of primary care outpatients and in 23% of outpatients with medically unexplained symptoms (de Waal et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005). A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV diagnoses in a sample of patients suggests that prevalence rates are similar across the old and new nomenclatures (Voigt et al. 2012). Older individuals with somatic symptom and related disorders are seen in all health care settings, where they frequently overuse medical services and overburden general practitioners (de Waal et al. 2008; Puri and Dimsdale 2011). They often come to the attention of a geriatric psychiatrist after another clinician has attempted unsuccessfully to resolve their physical symptoms. To date, the somatic symptom and related disorders have not been well studied in late life, in part because many of the disorders tend to begin in early adulthood. In addition, research involving older cohorts has usually focused on reported somatic symptoms rather than on specific diagnoses. A complicating factor is that somatoform symptoms in late life are often obscured by comorbid physical and psychiatric illnesses. In particular, these disorders have been strongly associated with stress, depression, anxiety, psychological trauma, substance abuse, and personality disorders (de Waal et al. 2004; Haftgoli et al. 2010; Hasin and Katz, 2007; Sack et al. 2007; Tomenson et al. 2012). DSM-5 is trying to make the diagnoses more parsimonious by eliminating the requirement for medically unexplained symptoms, but additional research is needed to further elucidate their characteristics under the new nomenclature.",

      "title": "Toward Validation of the Diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Unlike most psychiatric diagnoses, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined in relation to a potentially etiologic event (the traumatic \"stressor criterion\") that is fundamental to its conceptualization. The diagnosis of PTSD thus inherently depends on two separate but confounded processes: exposure to trauma and development of a specific pattern of symptoms that appear following the trauma. Attempts to define the range of trauma exposure inherent in the diagnosis of PTSD have generated controversy, as reflected in successive revisions of the criterion from DSM-III onward. It is still not established whether or not there are specific types of traumatic events and levels of exposure to them that are associated with a syndrome that is cohesive in clinical characteristics, biological correlates, familial patterns, and longitudinal diagnostic stability. On the other hand, the symptomatic description of PTSD is becoming more clear. Of three categories of symptoms associated with PTSD—intrusive memories, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal—avoidance and numbing appear to be the most specific for identification of PTSD. Research is now poised to answer questions about the relevance of traumatic events based on their relationship to symptomatic outcome. The authors recommend that future research begin with existing diagnostic criteria, testing and further refining them in accordance with the classic Robins and Guze strategy for validation of psychiatric diagnoses. In this process, diligent adherence to the criteria under examination is paramount to successful PTSD research, and changes in criteria are driven by empirical data rather than theory. Collaborations among trauma research biologists, epidemiologists, and nosologists to map the correspondence between the clinical and biological indicators of psychopathology are necessary to advance validation and further understanding of PTSD.",

It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

Only cognitive-behavioral techniques are desirable in the psychotherapeutic treatment of the disorder and the best results are achieved in combination with pharmacotherapy.

Sadness isn't a passing blue temperament, which nearly everybody encounters from time to time, but a complex mind/body sickness that meddling with ordinary working. It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving. It changes the structure and work of nerve cells so that it disturbs the way the brain forms data and deciphers involvement. In spite of sentiments of sadness and worthlessness, depression could be a treatable condition. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medicine, or a combination of both. Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

When stress becomes a prolonged or chronic experience, it can result in psychological distress, including generalized anxiety, burnout, and depressive symptoms. Anxiety, fatigue, burnout, and depression are familiar examples of \"distress\" and evidence has demonstrated that they are associated with prolonged exposure to stressful work. Many studies have shown an association between job strain and some form of psychological distress. Several other studies that have measured job strain and anxiety, often as part of a battery of \"psychological distress\" domains, have shown a positive correlation between high job strain and anxiety. Work-related stress can also be a factor in exacerbating pre-existing mental illnesses and may even precipitate clinically diagnosable symptoms of depression. The work environment is filled with challenges that provoke \"stress\" and engage our adaptive coping abilities.",

Survivors often face lifelong impairments affecting functional status, cognition, and mood. Depression, the most common mood disorder affecting TBI survivors, most likely is underdiagnosed and presents differently than primary depression or depression after other brain insults. Unfortunately, few studies have been reported that advance theoretical perspectives on post-TBI depression. Currently, there is some evidence that neurochemical and anatomical changes contribute to post-TBI depression. Interpersonal factors, such as sense of belonging and social support, may contribute to the incidence of post-TBI depression. Because of limited theoretical viewpoints, advances have not been made in cost-effective and efficient interventions for this mood disorder, which prolongs rehabilitation and contributes to family suffering.",

      "title": "Psychological Stress Dysfunction in Women with Premenstrual Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) encompasses a range of emotional, physiological, and behavioral symptoms that occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (MC) and resolve with the onset of menstruation. These symptoms, which can include fatigue, physical pain, anxiety, irritability, and depression, significantly affect women's daily lives and overall well-being. In severe cases, PMS can progress to premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), profoundly impairing quality of life. Despite its prevalence, the neural mechanisms underlying PMS-particularly those related to stress-are not fully understood.This review aims to explore the complex interactions between PMS and stress, with a focus on the hormonal pathways involved. We propose that abnormal stress coping styles and stress reactivity patterns, collectively referred to as stress dysfunction, are crucial factors influencing women's vulnerability to PMS. We examine the relationship between PMS and stress from four perspectives: (1) PMS shares neuroendocrine metabolic circuits based on hormonal fluctuations with stress reactivity systems; (2) there is comorbidity between PMS and stress-related disorders; (3) PMS itself may act as a stressor, potentially creating a negative feedback loop that exacerbates symptoms; and (4) biofeedback training used for stress disorders may be effective in treating PMS. By providing a detailed analysis of stress-related hormonal changes and their effects on PMS, this review offers new insights into the physiological processes underlying PMS. Understanding these interactions may inform the development of targeted interventions and improve the quality of life for women affected by PMS.",

      "abstract": "Psychological reactions to negative life events have been among the most interesting subjects to researchers for a long time. In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

The victim, as the recipient of the rapist's anger and need to control, experiences terror, fear of death, and helplessness. This results in classic posttraumatic symptoms of haunting, intrusive recollections, numbing or constriction of feelings and focus, and increased arousal. When this psychological trauma is not integrated, anxiety, depression, phobias, impaired sexual and social adjustment, negative self-image, and diminished capacity to enjoy life follow. Concepts of posttraumatic stress are reviewed and a definition of sexual assault is offered. The posttraumatic stress response to sexual assault is considered under the phases of response and symptoms, followed by the psychodynamics of this particular psychic trauma.

The definition of the psychological trauma and stressor-related disorders have had many changes in order to clarify diagnostic criterion of the disorder related to the exposure to traumatic or stressful event. However, as psychological distress following exposure to the traumatic event or stressful event is quite variable and, for the past more than three decades, the clinicians tried to establish the most reliable assessment and treatment techniques for PTSD. At the same time, the law faces its own dilemma about this disorder in particular when serious clinical case is charged for the offence. To both the medicine and the law it is clear that many individuals who have been exposed to the traumatic or stressful event exhibit a phenotype in which the most prominent clinical characteristics are anhedonic and dysphoric symptoms, externalizing anger and rage, dissociative symptoms, and relationship changes [2]. Subsequently, PTSD made its way into the courtroom as the outcomes of criminal defences for both violent and non-violent crime.",

Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline.

It is important to consider the differential impacts of acute and chronic stressors. Field studies assessing the impact of stressors on immune and endocrine functioning are certainly more relevant to the analysis of wellbeing than studies conducted in contrived laboratory settings. Acute stressors of moderate severity increase, whereas severe stressors may reduce cytokine levels, as might a chronic stressor regimen. In humans, it is much more difficult to identify the impact of acute and chronic stressors in natural settings, as the acuteness of the stressor and its severity are often entwined. The relation between stress and diurnal cortisol changes is not a simple one, but instead varies as a function of the mood or pathological condition evoked.",

These situations are associatively connected to the past but the patient is unaware of the connection. Acting out has to be differentiated from other neurotic actions which occur during analysis. In particular it has to be differentiated from symptomatic actions and abreaction experiences. Acting out differs from symptomatic actions in that the symptomatic act is ego alien and usually refers to part of a past situation. Acting out occurs very frequently during analysis. It should be remembered, however, that it also occurs outside the realm of psychoanalysis, but then it is not available for investigation and interpretation. The main reason for the frequent occurrence of acting out during the course of analysis is bound up with the transference.",

Hysterical phenomena that happen to students at several schools in the country cause ill effects either in the forms of psychological standpoint, physical or spiritual. In dealing with hysterical symptoms, signs and symptoms of hysteria should be identified in advance so that appropriate preventive measures and accurate can be suggested. Results of the study conducted via library literature found that the hysterical symptoms can be identified by three categories, namely symptoms from the angles of psychology, psychiatry and the Islamic treatment. From a psychological standpoint, is that students bear emotional disorders such as depressed mood, anxious, depressed feeling, irritable, sensitivity to the environment, and also self-adjustment problems, coping skills problems and so on. While in the angle of clinical, the symptoms of hysteria shown are identified through two different types of symptoms, namely subsection syndrome (dissociative hysteria) and transform syndrome (conversion disorder). Then, in the angle of Islamic treatment, hysterical symptoms can be seen through screaming, raving, aggressive action and out of control, crying, loss of consciousness and also appearing signs of interference by spirits and demons. The symptoms generally are the symptoms that lead to the hysterical symptoms to adolescent in Malaysia.

      "title": "Relationship between stress and pain in work‐related upper extremity disorders: The hidden role of chronic multisymptom illnesses*",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Pain and fatigue are commonly associated with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Occasionally these symptoms persist beyond a reasonable healing period. One potential explanation for prolonged symptom expression is the concurrent development of a stress‐mediated illness or CMI (Chronic Multi‐Symptom Illness). In such a scenario, the chronic regional pain and other symptoms that the individual is experiencing would be attributable to the CMI rather than to tissue damage or a biomechanical dysfunction of the upper‐extremity. Methods This article critically reviews the case definitions of the new class of CMI disorders and evaluates the existing evidence supporting centrally mediated physiological changes (e.g., sensory hypervigilance, dysautonomia) that manifest as symptoms of pain and fatigue in some individuals experiencing chronic stressors. Results While explanations for prolonged pain and fatigue have historically focused on mechanisms involving peripheral pathology or psychiatric explanations, ample evidences support the role of altered Central Nervous System function in accounting for symptom manifestation in CMI. Conclusions A model is presented that unites seemingly disparate findings across numerous investigations and provides a framework for understanding how genetics, triggering events, stressors, and early life events can affect CNS activity. Resultant symptom expression (e.g., pain and fatigue) from central dysregulation would be expected to occur in a subset of individuals in the population, including a subset of individuals with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Thus when symptoms such as pain and fatigue persist beyond a reasonable period, consideration of CMI and associated assessment and interventions focused on central mechanisms may be worthwhile. Am.

Especially profound consequences are provoked by chronic stressor experiences, including chronic pain and illness, which are moderated by how these events are appraised and the coping methods that are adopted. Stressful experiences promote a constellation of neurotransmitter, hormone, and growth factor alterations and can affect immune and inflammatory processes. These actions may contribute to the development and progression of numerous illnesses, including cancer progression and metastasis. These effects are most prominent when biological systems are overly taxed, which may be linked to diverse psychosocial contributions as well as genetic and epigenetic factors. Stressors encountered early in life as well as prenatal challenges may have persistent repercussions so the vulnerability to illness may be elevated in adulthood. Understanding the multiple biological effects of stressors may be fundamental in developing strategies to limit the psychological disturbances and may facilitate the development of strategies to prevent and treat somatic disorders.",

Depression in three groups of medically ill, disabled patients (Parkinson's disease, right hemisphere stroke, and amputation) was studied. Mean depression severity and frequency of depression were equal for all groups. Severity of neurologic symptomatology was not consistently related to depression. Type of prosthesis, but not amputation type, was related to depression for amputees. Patterns of depression on discriminant analysis did differentiate the groups. A depression symptom conglomerate suggesting guilt and body image change with fatigue characterized the Parkinson patients most and the amputees least. A second depression conglomerate suggesting indecisiveness and thoughts of death or self-harm characterized amputees most and stroke patients least. Depression as an emotional response may not be a singular, specific feature of disabling illness in general, given uniformity of prevalence and severity, but differential etiology in specific instances should be considered.",

People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

Is human emotional behavior based on primary biological mechanism that human inherited not only from close animal predecessors, but also significantly more distant kinds on evolutionary ladder? Results of researches indicate that aggressiveness is stable pattern of behavior in children and young people. Aggressive behavior of humans decreases over the years, although certain types of personalities preserve stability of aggressive behavior. Psychological profile of torturer includes diagnostical category of antisocial personality disorder. Mental consequences resulting from torture are depression, psychosomatic reactions, aggression, state of anxiety. The contribution of victimology is significant, particularly from aspect of “selecting” psychopathological reaction. It is also important whether the torturer is known to be victims or it is a stranger. It is understandable that consequences are much more severe with people who had unfortunate to be tortured by known person. The most common psychopathological reactions are: 1. Fear lived during the torture. 2. Depressive reaction. 3. Aggression - which may not be demonstrated in adequate manner, may be shifted to other people, which may create interpersonal disputes, before all for the victim and represents one of physical consequences resulting from torture. Torture prevention is problem of individuals, community and society as whole. Degradation of authorities in one society leads to moral erosion, and on its part, to torture on all functioning levels.",

He was hospitalized repeatedly and over long periods for surgical complications related to his disease. He presented with “problems of adjustment” in the surgery department. We met following nine months of hospitalization, when the patient complained of acute diarrhea with severe aftereffects preventing his release home, and which the surgeons could not explain. The surgeons then asked for the liaison psychiatrist’s opinion regarding a possible psychiatric disorder.\nDiscussion: The questions posed by the surgeons and the patient’s previous history suggested a diagnosis of a painful somatic symptom disorder. The patient had been treated in parallel for depression over the previous five months. Cognitive impairment in this patient could have been linked to the sequelae of an ischemic stroke or a central nervous system disorder.\nSpecific Aspects: This patient had a severe cognitive impairment and was in a socially precarious situation. Furthermore, Sharp’s syndrome is a systemic disease that can present significant psychiatric manifestations, as in Lupus. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to these psychiatric disorders are poorly known, and involve inflammatory, immunological, and infectious mechanisms. In addition, this patient had significant psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Working together, social worker and nephrologist were able to achieve appropriate overall care management of this patient.\nConclusion: Mr. T, suffering from Sharp’s syndrome, presented with a painful somatic symptom disorder.

      "abstract": "A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is essential because many psychiatric symptoms are nonspecific. This situation is analogous to a patient presenting in general internal medicine with fever or nausea. The presence of a single symptom, for example, depressed mood, is never pathognomonic of a specific disorder. All psychiatric disorders are based on a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is periodically updated by the American Psychiatric Association. The fourth edition (DSM-IV) is currently in use. It was published in 1994 and is expected to be revised in 2006 or 2007. For patients with psychiatric symptoms, the biopsychosocial model is widely used. With this approach, the biologic, psychologic, and social factors contributing to the patient's clinical presentation are evaluated. Some psychiatric symptoms indicate severe problems, whereas others are much less important to the extent that they may not be clinically relevant.

      "abstract": "A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is essential because many psychiatric symptoms are nonspecific. This situation is analogous to a patient presenting in general internal medicine with fever or nausea. The presence of a single symptom, for example, depressed mood, is never pathognomonic of a specific disorder. All psychiatric disorders are based on a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is periodically updated by the American Psychiatric Association. The fourth edition (DSM-IV) is currently in use. It was published in 1994 and is expected to be revised in 2006 or 2007. For patients with psychiatric symptoms, the biopsychosocial model is widely used. With this approach, the biologic, psychologic, and social factors contributing to the patient's clinical presentation are evaluated. Some psychiatric symptoms indicate severe problems, whereas others are much less important to the extent that they may not be clinically relevant. A key concept is whether the symptom interferes with a patient's functioning or causes distress. For example, a patient may have a fear of heights. If this acrophobia never causes an alteration in activity, then intervention likely is not necessary.

      "abstract": "Mood disorders according to DSM V, like all other psychiatric disorders, are still based\r\n on the description and grouping of symptoms. The emotional state can change in two\r\n directions: an elevated mood (which can oscillate from hypomania to mania) and lower\r\n mood (depression). For diagnosing mood disorder, it is essential to have a more\r\n comprehensive diagnostic formulation. The role plays careful observation and identifying\r\n the symptoms, which are used as the most important method for diagnosing mood\r\n disorders. There must be diagnostic criteria for each disease to determine the spectrum of\r\n symptoms occurring in the disease, but it is also important that there are minimal\r\n symptoms when deciding which diagnosis will be given to the patient. In the patient\r\n besides the main mental problem, the appearance of other illnesses, such as the\r\n circumstances that have arisen in the patient's life, and in the working and social\r\n environment, must be considered. We set the mood disorder diagnosis based on anamnesis,\r\n clinical picture, and course of the disease. In basic symptoms of depression, there is a loss\r\n of interest in, until then, important things and activities. The disturbances must last at least\r\n two weeks in order to be a depressive episode. Along with the symptoms that are\r\n compulsory, there are also symptoms such as loss of energy, appetite, sense of worth and /\r\n or guilt, deconcentration, helplessness, indecision, and suicidal thoughts until attempted\r\n suicide. Patients can become so frozen that they can not show the usual emotions, such as\r\n sorrow, joy or pleasure, or they may feel that the world around them without color and life\r\n is dead. The main symptoms that characterize mania are elevated mood, increased energy\r\n and activity. These patients experience graceful ideas, they think they have tremendous\r\n power, they think they can change the whole world. One of the picture of the disease that\r\n can occur in manic patients is the appearance of interpersonal conflicts, which can lead to\r\n paranoid treatment of reality. Pharmacological and psychological therapy gives the best\r\n results, and it is important to emphasize to the patient and family that the therapy does not\r\n have immediate effect, but that the therapy should take about two to six weeks for the drug\r\n / drugs to take effect. The patient should be monitored permanently and analyzed the\r\n results achieved. If the desired results have not been reached, it is necessary to change the\r\n approach and therapy.",

      "title": "Chronic stress in sheep: assessment tools and their use in different management conditions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic stress occurs when animals are unable to deal with a persistent stressor with species-typical responses, or when several stressors are present concurrently. Chronic stress is most frequently considered in intensive systems, but it may also be a welfare concern for extensively managed species, such as the sheep. Here we review behavioural and physiological responses of sheep to experimentally induced chronic stressors to determine relevant indicators of chronic stress. Neuroendocrine responses to chronic stress are difficult to interpret because initial responses are followed by an apparent normalisation. Thus, cortisol or catecholamines may be at or below pre-stress levels during chronic stress, but this varies with different stressors. Chronic stress can also affect reproductive function, impair body and wool growth and meat quality, reduce immune function, and is associated with greater parasite burdens in sheep. Chronic stress induces alterations in behaviour patterns, particularly activity and feeding, and circadian rhythms of behaviour. Stereotypic behaviours, however, are infrequent in sheep and may occur only in experimental conditions of social isolation. Behavioural and physiological data suggest that rough handling and sheepdogs may be sources of chronic stress for sheep. Social subordination and weaning also act as chronic stressors, leading to higher parasitism in these animals and a greater response to additional stressors. Lameness and parasitism are associated with physiological and behavioural responses indicating that these are severe forms of chronic stress in sheep. It is unclear whether environmental stressors, such as weather and food availability, induce chronic stress in sheep. Under-nutrition may, however, be a welfare concern through its impact on lamb survival. The existence of many sources of chronic stress in the management of sheep suggests that the welfare of this species requires more attention than it has currently received.",

      "title": "Physical symptoms of depression: unmet needs.",
      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

Anxiety is a conspicuous and an integral element of affective state and may be expressed by severe restlessness and agitation. Muscle tension, wringing of hands, weeping and moaning, repeating over and over in a monotonous and stereotyped way phrases expressive of misery are all important clinical signs of major depression. Similarly tachycardia, dry tongue/mouth, sweaty palms and/or bodily extremities, cold clammy skin, pallor, pupillary dilatation, tremor, and the fluctuations in blood pressure with wide pulse pressure are all important and give away the underlying distress. These signs have formed an integral part of both the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale as they have a positive correlation with the diagnosis and the severity of illness. Current practice of operational criteria does not help exclude patients with subjective perception of distress and also fails to make room for aetiopathogenesis. The DSM-IV does not include these physical signs as an integral part of the clinical picture of depression, consequently leaving the diagnosis of MDE to subjective criteria and perceptions.

Lack of motivation and social dependency in old people result from a failure of the psychological mechanism of elaboration. We present a phenomenological point of view and advance some propositions for their prevention. Loss of motivation appears to be an acquired and dynamic process resulting from the psychological difficulties experienced by the individual due to the loss of autonomy and an increasing dependency which is not accepted although, paradoxically, searched for.

      "title": "Mindfulness for surgeons",
      "abstract": "In addition to having the knowledge and technical skills to practice surgery, an ideal surgeon is attentive and focused, relaxed, deals with contingencies calmly, flexible and resilient, unburdened by previous cases or external situations, and is warm and compassionate to patients, families and colleagues. In reality, surgeons, like most humans, are typically not really present. Our minds are commonly described as 'monkey minds', restless, confused and easily distracted, with attention easily hijacked by stimuli, little different from a monkey that jumps from branch to branch side-tracked by fruits or anything of fleeting interest. Humans tend to daydream and ruminate about negative events, past failures and future worries.1, 2 The mind reacts to such events resulting in anger, irritation, frustration, excitement, sadness or disgust. This highly reactive and untamed mind can result in depression, anxiety, addictions and interpersonal conflicts. In short, the untrained mind is prone to being unhappy.1 Mindfulness is an alternate mind state or way of being to the typical stressed and untrained state that predisposes physicians and surgeons to fatigue and burnout.3-8 Mindfulness is distinct from other stress management techniques such as going on holiday or using alcohol, both of which are forms of escaping from the problem. After the holiday or upon sobering up, the problem remains or is worsened. There is no escaping from stress as there will always be stress. However, instead of running away from stress, an alternative approach is to change the way we generate and relate to it. Mindfulness allows practitioners to look at their stress calmly, accepting the situation and then responding appropriately. Mindfulness is not a way out of daily troubles but instead is a 'way in'. Mindfulness is among the most poorly understood terms in contemporary psychological parlance. It is often confused with meditating, yoga or any number of ostensibly 'new age' fashions. Admittedly, it is true that mindfulness has a tradition stretching back more than 2500 years with roots in the Buddhist tradition where mindfulness and compassion are seen as the path for genuine happiness and enlightenment. However, modern conceptualizations of mindfulness have less to do with religion or spirituality and more to do with attempting to cultivate a very particular mental state, one characterized by continuous awareness of the present moment in a calm and accepting manner. Rather than ruminatively chewing on events that occurred in the past or frenetically evaluating what the future may bring, the attention of the mindful person rests here and now. In some ways, however, mindfulness is also defined by what it is not. It is not religious. Though developed and practiced by Buddhists, mindfulness does not concern itself with deity worship, spirits or the afterlife, and does not require sitting in a lotus position chanting. Though traditional mindfulness meditation is practised while seated, one can learn and practise mindfulness in many ways from sitting on a chair or walking from the car park to the hospital to possibly even while performing a procedure. Mindfulness does not involve stopping thinking, which is almost impossible to do while awake and conscious. Mindfulness will not eliminate stress and disappointments. However, mindfulness will allow a person to accept stress and frustration as part of life. Being attentive to the present moment involves knowing and accepting the emotional state we are in, whether we are relaxed, tense, frustrated, happy, neutral, grateful or angry. In this mindful state, we are also aware of current bodily sensations (e.g. the breath, the feel of the gloves hugging the hands) as well as of environmental stimuli (e.g. soft wind on the face while walking from the car park). A mindful person is calmly accepting of whatever will happen, resulting in a relaxed mind. For example, if a surgeon accidentally nicks a major vessel, the surgeon curses himself, thinking that he should not be making mistakes. Worrying that this patient will die on the table does not help the impending disaster. He starts barking at his assistant who then makes more mistakes. The theatre atmosphere feels heavy and the anxious anaesthetist makes a poor judgment call. On the other hand, a surgeon who calmly accepts the accident as part of the life of even the most skilled surgeon will be focused and unruffled and can address the major bleed more effectively, supported by an unflustered team. Without denying their existence or import, mindfulness can tame the emotional parts of the brain (e.g. limbic system and amygdala) while enhancing the logical prefrontal cortex to come up with a repertoire of options.9 Viewed in this manner, mindfulness is perhaps less foreign or off-putting to the surgeon. Indeed, the physical and psychological state of calm engagement, absorption, and focus the best surgeons experience while operating is a good example of the advantages mindfulness can bring to performance. This desirable state, sometimes called a 'flow' experience, is a period of total immersion and union with the activity.10 To reiterate, mindfulness is not a religious practice and instead is a mind training exercise. The best way to develop the ability to be mindful is to practise, beginning with short periods of mindfulness exercises then progressively incorporating mindfulness into daily activities. Learning mindfulness is not different from learning a new sport or a new surgical technique. It requires regular practice, patience and an open attitude to the learning. So mindfulness is not a religion, nor is it a cult. It is a way of being mentally and physically 'present' that is familiar to many surgeons (at least in work) and bears a resemblance to experiences of flow. The question that remains, however, is why surgeons should care about mindfulness or consider its practice as a part of their professional development. Although there are few studies of mindfulness among health-care professionals, early results are promising.11 Studies among other non-professional and patient populations, however, suggest that mindfulness interventions and practice are associated with benefits in a massive range of mental and physical health outcomes. Briefly, mindfulness has been linked to better quality of life,12, 13 subjective well-being and mood,11, 14 subjective health,15 and sleep;16 objective benefits are evident in patient samples including persons with pain, hypertension and arthritis.14 Mindfulness lowers stress,17 anxiety and depression,14, 18 and emotional exhaustion,4, 6, 11 prevents depression relapse,19 and reduces the extent to which stress produces depression and anxiety.20 Emotional reactivity to stressors is reduced21-24 and recovery may be enhanced.25 Cognitively, mindfulness is associated with improved executive functioning,26 better attention,27-29 reduced emotional interference in cognitive tasks,30 more situationally appropriate decision-making31 and better behavioural regulation.23 Relevant to doctors, mindfulness lessens the chance of physician diagnostic errors32 and promotes better connection with patients.3, 6 Finally, mindfulness interventions have been linked to sustained improvement and recovery of immune function,26, 33, 34 greater antibody titer response to influenza vaccinations,35 greater telomerase activity,36 as well as increases in left-sided anterior activation35 but reduced limbic reactivity37-41 in brain imaging work. These effects are not inconsequential, with reviews suggesting a standardized effect size of 0.5 on health.15 Similar to aspirin preventing future cardiovascular events,42-44 mindfulness appears to be protective against physician burnout.4, 6 Given that many surgeons naturally practise a form of mindfulness while performing surgery, it is a short step to allowing this way of being to extend to other areas of life. Given the chronic, high levels of stress and burnout surgeons' experience,45 and the repeatedly demonstrated benefits of mindfulness in terms of such outcomes, developing the capacity to be mindful may have immediate and very real mental and physical health benefits. So mindfulness interventions appear to work. The average surgeon, however, may or may not have the time to allocate evenings for 8 weeks in formal training (e.g. MBSR5) or to sit and meditate for substantial amounts of time. Fortunately then, while mindfulness skills can be acquired in this way, they can also be obtained in small 'doses', structured to fit around the busy professional and personal lives most surgeons live. Instructions for mindfulness exercises and meditations are offered online (e.g. www.calm.auckland.ac.nz46) and in books (e.g. Siegel's book 'Mindsight: the new science of personal transformation'47). Beginners can start with short daily exercises of 5 min, gradually lengthening the duration; regular practitioners allocate 30 min to formal practice as well as incorporating mindfulness states into daily activities. To begin, find a quiet place and time with minimal distraction or interruption. Remind yourself to try to focus on the exercise for 5 min. Close your eyes and assume a half smile (creates a gentle positive state) and take three slow, deep breaths; pay attention to the sensations of breathing. After that, simply breathe normally while paying attention to the process. Sooner or later, you will inevitably get distracted by thoughts, sounds or judgments. When this happens, simply notice the distraction and return to breath. At the end of 5 min, gradually cease the practice and be grateful for having those 5 min of quiet. As when you learn a new sport, the DIY approach can only bring you to a certain level of proficiency. Many beginning meditators give up too quickly because they notice their minds are very busy and judge themselves as unable to be mindful. In actual fact, the contrary is true in that they are becoming mindful of their baseline busy mental state, which already indicates significant progress. To further enhance mindfulness skills, attending suitable courses or having one-on-one mindfulness coaching will be very helpful. Like any new skill, practice and patience is important. Try not to focus on the end point or outcome as the process itself is beneficial. Studies have shown that naïve mindfulness trainees notice improvement in mental and health outcomes, with brain changes and increased immune functioning with 4–8 weeks of regular practice.6, 13, 35 Within the demanding and stressful life of a surgeon, mindfulness is an alternative way of being. The evidence is strong in terms of the physical and psychological benefits of mindfulness. Though it requires practice, learning it is not hard and will pay benefit for both surgeons and their patients.",

Other variables such as genetic history differing treatment or clinical characteristics did not explain the results. These findings support the hypothesis that repeated spells of depressive illness, when characterised by anxiety and agitation, lead to a sustained rise in blood pressure.",

      "abstract": "Advances in the treatment of mental disorders and more tolerant social attitudes have greatly lessened the stigma attached to psychiatric diagnoses in Western industrialized societies in the last 30 years. Nevertheless, some segments of the population still regard emotional illness as abhorrent. Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, nausea, or headaches are common complaints among the worried well, the physically ill, and the mentally ill. Many people have a strong need to attribute these symptoms to an underlying physical cause, particularly if they eschew a psychological etiology. This partially explains the evolution, during the 1980s, of several poorly defined syndromes that have gained popularity in explaining a wide range of nonspecific symptoms. This paper deals with three of these poorly documented conditions - environmental hypersensitivity disorder, candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome, and postinfectious chronic fatigue syndrome [1-3] - and their relationship to a variety of psychiatric diagnoses.",

The signs were associated with other clinical measures of illness behavior and distress, and are not simply a feature of medicolegal presentations. Despite clear caveats about the interpretation of the signs, they have been misinterpreted and misused both clinically and medicolegally. Behavioral responses to examination provide useful clinical information, but need to be interpreted with care and understanding. Isolated signs should not be overinterpreted. Multiple signs suggest that the patient does not have a straightforward physical problem, but that psychological factors also need to be considered. Some patients may require both physical management of their physical pathology and more careful management of the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of their illness. Behavioral signs should be understood as response affected by fear in the context of recovery from injury and the development of chronic incapacity. They offer only a psychological \"yellow-flag\" and not a complete psychological assessment. Behavioral signs are not on their own a test of credibility or faking.",

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric disorders: post-stroke depression. A review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder after stroke, and also the main factor limiting recovery and rehabilitation in stroke patients, which leaded to poor quality of life. A prevalence of 30% is estimated between 1 to 5 years after stroke. More than half of all cases are neither diagnosed nor treated. Objectives The aim of this paper is to review the latest updates regarding post-stroke depression and progress in its diagnosis and treatment. Methods A systematic review of the scientific and clinical literature on PSD was conducted. The review included databases such as PubMed and Cochrane, covering articles from the past 10 years. The scientific evidence obtained was analyzed and synthesized. Results Currently, the diagnosis of PSD is mainly based on the DSM guidelines and combined with various depression scales. Symptoms usually occur within the first three months after stroke, the patient presents symptoms of a depressive episode such as low mood, anhedonia, loss of appetite, sleep disorders, vegetative symptoms or social withdrawal. Several mechanisms, including biological, behavioural, and social factors, are involved in its pathogenesis. The main predictors are personal history or cognitive impairment, as well as sequelae of the stroke. Left hemispheric strokes are those with the highest risk of early depression, as well as small subcortical vessel pathology. Treatment is mainly pharmacological, with SSRIs. The probability of recovery is between 15 and 57% in the first year, with a recurrence of 38% at two years, up to 100% at 15 years. In addition, there is an increase in mortality, especially in those under 65 years of age. Conclusions There are still many unanswered questions in the treatment of PSD, such as the best time to start treatment or the effects of antidepressants on cognition and motor function, among others. Although great advance has been made by researchers, the mechanism of PSD is not completely clear. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

However, a generally accepted understanding and clear definition of what is constituted by psychological pain do not exist. Morse and colleagues' criteria (definition, characteristics, boundaries, preconditions, outcomes) were used to analyze related concepts (suffering, psychache, emotional pain, and psychic pain) that could contribute to a definition of psychological pain. The analysis indicated that psychological pain may best be defined as a lasting, unsustainable, and unpleasant feeling resulting from negative appraisal of an inability or deficiency of the self. This negative self-appraisal is typically brought on by loss of someone or something, or failure to achieve something that is intimately linked to core psychological needs.",

Acute stress response of the body is associated with activation of various organ systems, resulting in the release of cortisol and catecholamines. Acute stress response subsides on the resolution of the precipitating stimulus. The persistence of the precipitating stimulus results in chronic stress and burn-out. Longitudinal studies have shown that chronic stress can result in both mental and physical health outcomes. The mental health outcomes include depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder etc. The physical health outcomes include effects on multiple organ systems. It is, therefore, essential to identify and rectify the precipitating factors to minimize the impact of stress on the human body. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2024;54(10):e272–e276.]",

      "abstract": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) was described for the first time in the 19th century by Silas Weir Mitchell. After the exclusion of other causes, CRPS is characterised by a typical clinical constellation of pain, sensory, autonomic, motor, or trophic symptoms which can no longer be explained by the initial trauma. These symptoms spread distally and are not limited to innervation territories. If CRPS is not improved in the acute phase and becomes chronic, the visible symptoms change throughout because of the changing pathophysiology; the pain, however, remains. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, although in complex cases further technical examination mainly for exclusion of alternative diagnoses is warranted. In the initial phase, the pathophysiology is dominated by a posttraumatic inflammatory reaction by the activation of the innate and adaptive immune system. In particular, without adequate treatment, central nociceptive sensitization, reorganisation, and implicit learning processes develop, whereas the inflammation moderates. The main symptoms then include movement disorders, alternating skin temperature, sensory loss, hyperalgesia, and body perception disturbances. Psychological factors such as posttraumatic stress or pain-related fear may impact the course and the treatability of CRPS. The treatment should be ideally adjusted to the pathophysiology. Pharmacological treatment maybe particularly effective in acute stages and includes steroids, bisphosphonates, and dimethylsulfoxide cream. Common anti-neuropathic pain drugs can be recommended empirically. Intravenous long-term ketamine administration has shown efficacy in randomised controlled trials, but its repeated application is demanding and has side effects. Important components of the treatment include physio- and occupational therapy including behavioural therapy (eg, graded exposure in vivo and graded motor imaging). If psychosocial comorbidities exist, patients should be appropriately treated and supported. Invasive methods should only be used in specialised centres and in carefully evaluated cases. Considering these fundamentals, CRPS often remains a chronic pain disorder but the devastating cases should become rare.",

      "title": "LIVING WITH A CHRONIC DISEASE, EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TO CHRONIC DISEASE",
      "abstract": "The way the individual is psychologically affected by the disease depends on many factors. Some of them include the nature of the disease, its severity and treatment, other factors that affect the ability of individuals to cope with the disease related to their personality, circumstances in their life before illness and the level of social support that they have. Regardless of these factors, all individuals pass certain stages while trying to adjust and cope with the reality of the chronic condition. In this paper we review the stages of acceptance of the chronic disease and emotional reactions to the chronic disease such as sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, depression and guilt. When a person finds out that it's diagnosed with chronic illness, first reaction may be shock, denial and disbelief that anything is wrong. The persistence of the symptoms is difficult to ignore. The resistance to the actual changes that occur in the body cause a person to be exerting much more than its body can sustain, creating exhaustion and a growing decrease of strength. In response to the uncertainty of the future, a feeling of anxiety and fear of the possible loss of unrealized goals may appear, which leads to sadness, depression and regret. Additional losses occur in the form of a force to abandon previous roles and responsibilities which leads to a feeling of inadequacy and guilt. A person becomes sensitive to the potential burden that now his loved ones can feel, which leads to more shame and eventual dissatisfaction and anger. The loss of the sense of independence has an impact on self-confidence, self-esteem and self-image, a real identity crisis can appear. As a result of the increased sense of dependence, emotions associated with loss of status, power and control occurs, which exceed once healthy and capable functioning of the individual. Very often a stigma is present which is associated with the illness and may also be a result of reactions from others, including friends and family and all that can cause an increased withdrawal and isolation. The individual becomes affected by a sense of abandonment, rejection and loneliness. Bringing together all these possible reactions, guilt and self-punishment occurs, imposed upon themselves because they have the disease in the first place. In addition to trying to cope with this disease on a daily basis, it is not surprising that the profound nature of these emotional consequences can cause a feeling of helplessness and hopelessness. Fortunately, there are ways that a person can learn to move through all the complex reactions and adjustments he is facing, as he will pass through the different stages of the disease.",

Few studies have defined the critical features of these stressful situations, or examined the role of stress-mediating and -moderating variables. Available evidence indicates that the relationship between life stress and relapse is complex, and is likely to depend on factors such as stressor chronicity, frequency, severity and type, and individual patient characteristics such as depression, health locus of control and coping strategy use. Little is known about how these factors, individually or in combination, are related to MS disease activity. Viral infections are also likely to precipitate relapse in MS, and significant life-stress may further enhance this relationship. The nature and strength of these interrelationships have strong clinical implications. MS patients are particularly vulnerable to a deteriorating cycle of stressful life events, illness episodes and disability. Timely multidisciplinary care interventions aimed at both minimizing psychological distress and physical symptoms may halt this downward reciprocal cycle. Little is known of the pathogenesis of these putative stress-induced changes in disease activity, and almost all stressor studies suffer from some biases or limitations.",

Classical psychoanalytic conceptualization of the etiology of TMJ disorders has not been systematically examined, but has been widely accepted and found clinically useful by some therapists. 6. Clinical impressions notwithstanding, there is little evidence to indicate that TMJ disorders are correlated with one specific personality trait. Perhaps more definitive assessments will reveal uniform personality characteristics in subclasses of TMJ patients. 7. Emotional factors (e.g., anxiety, fear, frustration, and anger) play a significant role in the etiology of TMJ disorders, in that they elicit muscular tension and oral habits. Although it would appear unlikely that emotionally induced muscle activity is a \"necessary\" factor, it is probable that it will be found a \"sufficient\" cause for TMJ disorders. 8. Learning principles, should not be considered as an alternative etiological position but should be viewed as a framework upon which any psychological theory of etiology must be based. 9. The presence of chronic pain in TMJ patients may be of as much clinical significance in the prognosis as the physical findings associated with the disorder itself. 10. The potential placebo effect resulting from any treatment, coupled with other nonspecific effects of the doctor's attitudes, remains a powerful tool that can be utilized in treating TMJ disorders. A vital ingredient in the placebo effect is the quality of the doctor-patient relationship. 11. Patient evaluation should not only include a) a search for the immediate organic stimulus or biomechanical disturbance, but also b) an assessment of situational or chronic anxiety and other emotional factors and c) an observation of interpersonal styles of behavior commonly associated with the chronically sick patient. 12. Unilateral etiological views of TMJ disorders and rigid treatment approaches need modification. Treatment involving simultaneous dental and psychological approaches appears to have more promise.",

      "abstract": "Life stress has been found to be associated with onset of depression and with greater severity of depressive symptoms. It is unclear, though, if life stress is related to particular classes or specific symptoms in depression. The association between severe life events and depressive symptoms was tested in 59 individuals diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria with endogenous primary nonpsychotic major depression. As predicted, life stress was associated principally with cognitive-affective symptoms, not somatic symptoms. There also was a consistent association across different assessment methods between severe events and suicidal ideation. Finally, associations held specifically for severe events occurring before onset, not for severe events occurring after onset. Symptom variation in major depression is related specifically to severe stressors before onset and includes primarily cognitive-affective types of symptoms. There is an especially pronounced association of prior severe stress with suicidal ideation. The implications of stress-symptom associations are addressed for enlarging understanding of symptom heterogeneity and subtype distinctions in major depression.",

      "title": "Dimensionality and the category of major depressive episode",
      "abstract": "Major depressive episode (MDE) is a chronic disease typified by episodes that remit and recur. It is a major contributor to the burden of disease. The diagnosis of a disorder is an expert opinion that the disorder is present. The nine symptoms of MDE exist on dimensions of greater or lesser intensity, persistence over time, change in usual state, distress and impairment. It is the clinician's task to judge whether the elicited symptoms warrant the diagnosis. The surprise is that trained clinicians can do this reliably and that diagnostic interviews and questionnaires can emulate this process. The distribution of symptoms in community surveys is exponential, with no obvious discontinuity at the diagnostic threshold. Taxometric and primary care studies confirm this. The number of symptoms predicts severity, comorbidity, family history, disability, help seeking and treatment recommendations. The latent structure of mental disorders places MDE in the distress misery cluster. Measures of well-being, distress, disability and neuroticism correlate with the number of symptoms but the relation is not perfect. The Patient Health Questionnaire is derived from the diagnostic criteria and does not suffer this limitation. The introduction of measures like this would acknowledge dimensionality, would facilitate recognition, guide treatment, and be acceptable to consumers, providers and funders.

Prevalent somatic symptoms such as somatic dysesthesias, pain, memory disorders and disorders of performance often mislead diagnostic search particularly if depressive alterations of mood are less prominent. Therefore history gains special importance beside physical examination. Three main groups are distinguished: --symptomatic (exogenous) depression --neurotic (reactive) depression --so called tardive depression Detection of nosologic connections is difficult but a prerequisite for a successful therapeutic approach.

Evidence suggests that these comorbidities may be explained by a limited capacity of individuals to exert cognitive control on thoughts, emotions, or behaviors. A decrease of this capacity of control could contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain and its associated symptoms. Benefits of the cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of chronic pain may be explained by learning efficient and less costly pain coping strategies in terms of cognitive control capacity.",

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "title": "Adjustment Disorder and Its Clinical Management",
      "abstract": "Adjustment disorder is a condition of subjective emotional distress triggered as a consequence of a meaningful change in life. The diagnosis of adjustment disorder is hindered by the difficult operational definition of stress and of its related concept of “vulnerability,” by the problem of disentangling symptoms of adjustment disorder from those attributable to comorbid anxiety and mood disorders, and by the poor boundaries of the disorder with other stress-related conditions on the one hand and with common adaptation to life events on the other. Despite the high frequency of its diagnosis in clinical settings, there has been relatively little research on the adjustment disorder and, consequently, very few hints about its treatments. Several psychotherapies have been developed to deal with patients diagnosed with adjustment disorder, with inconclusive evidence on their effectiveness. Antidepressants may abate the symptoms and help patients reacquire occupational and social functioning. The medium-term outcome of adjustment disorder is good, with 70 to 80% of those diagnosed with it showing no evidence of psychopathology when reassessed 5 years from the episode. However, when comorbid with a personality disorder or a substance use disorder, the short-term risk of suicide may be increased. The long-term outcome of adjustment disorder seems to be worse in children and adolescents than in adults. In particular, adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder were more likely than adults to have received a diagnosis of a severe mental disorder at the 5-year follow-up, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder.

      "abstract": "Kernaussagen Definition und Diagnostik Die Diagnose Anpassungsstörung gehört zu den im DSM-IV und im ICD-10 eher weniger gut operationalisierten Kategorien. Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality.

      "abstract": "Empirical results from epidemiological studies on pain-depression comorbidity in primary care and population samples have shown that: (a) pain is as strongly associated with anxiety as with depressive disorders; (b) characteristics that most strongly predict depression are diffuseness of pain and the extent to which pain interferes with activities; (c) certain psychological symptoms (low energy, disturbed sleep, worry) are prominent among pain patients, while others (guilt, loneliness) are not; (d) depression and pain dysfunction are evident early in the natural history of pain, but dysfunction and distress are often transient; and (e) among initially dysfunctional pain patients whose dysfunction is chronic, depression levels do not improve but neither do they increase over time with chronicity alone. These results seem consistent with these mechanisms of pain-depression comorbidity; (1) a trait of susceptibility to both dysphoric physical symptoms (including pain) and psychological symptoms (including depression), and a state of somatosensory amplification in which psychological distress amplifies dysphoric physical sensations (including pain); (2) psychological illness and behavioural dysfunction being interrelated features of a maladaptive response to pain evident early in the natural history of the condition, and often resolving during an early recovery phase; (3) pain constituting a significant physical and psychological stressor that may induce or exacerbate psychological distress. Thus, pain and psychological illness should be viewed as having reciprocal psychological and behavioural effects involving both processes of illness expression and adaption, as well as pain having specific effects on emotional state and behavioural function.",

It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

A diagnosis of PMS requires that the symptoms be severe enough to affect a woman's ability to function at home or in the workplace or in her relationships with others. Diagnostic assessment entails a thorough medical and psychiatric history and prospective daily ratings. Disorders such as major depression, anxiety, hypothyroidism, and diabetes must be excluded before a diagnosis of PMS can be considered. Treatment strategies include either eliminating the hormonal cycle associated with ovulation or treating the symptom(s) causing the most distress to the patient. Medical therapies are available for both treatment approaches but should be initiated only after behavioral measures have failed; the physician must also carefully weigh the severity of symptoms against the potential for adverse effects of treatment.",

      "title": "Transcultural Aspects of Somatic Symptoms in the Context of Depressive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptoms are a common presentation of mental disorders or psychological distress worldwide, and may often coexist with depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus accounting for what might be the most frequent psychiatric syndrome in primary care. Indeed, physical symptoms accompanying the clinical presentations of a variety of mental disorders may be considered as universal 'idioms of distress' that may vary across cultures, depending on attitudes and explanations embedded in each one of them. These variations in symptom presentations are the result of various interacting factors that ultimately determine how individuals identify and classify bodily sensations, perceive illness, and seek medical attention. This chapter examines the impact of culture on the experiencing of somatic symptoms, based on an inclusive review of the topic from ethnic, nosological, clinical and social perspectives. Particular attention is paid to the association of somatic symptoms with mood symptoms, since depressive disorders appear to be the most common, costly and disabling psychiatric entities worldwide. The review shows that racial/ethnic variations in somatic symptoms in the context of depression are common, and seem to be related to depression severity. Sociocultural factors, particularly stigma, may influence the unique emphasis placed on somatic symptoms within depression, and may account for some racial/ethnic differences in somatic symptom reporting.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Pain is “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or [is] described in terms of uch dama e” when there is no h sical deran ement 1 The function of ain is to protect the body by making the organism aware of damaging events and to promote healing by causing sensitivity to movement or other stimuli that may delay recovery. However, pain is not always related to tissue damage and does not always serve a protective function. This is the case with neuropathic pain, which is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory parts of the nervous system, and with some other chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and migraine.2 Acute and chronic pain may cause suffering and interfere with daily life, factors that influence the choice of treatment. Acute pain is the most common reason for visiting an emergency department,3 and surgical procedures are often associated with acute postoperative pain.4,5 Chronic pain also causes suffering, as reflected by the finding in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 that chronic low back pain was the leading cause of years lived with disability.6 In addition to the contribution of pain to disability, that study showed that the associated problem of opioid use disorders accounted for 5.8 million additional years lived with disability,6 an observation that underpins attempts to treat pain with drugs other than opioids. Long-term opioid administration has minimal effects on chronic pain and can cause tolerance, drowsiness, and dependence, as well as impaired memory, concentration, and judgment.7 For these reasons, the International Association for the Study of Pain recommends caution in prescribing opioids for chronic pain,8 and there has been an increased emphasis on the use of nonopioid pain management. The choice of treatment for pain depends on many factors, and the heterogeneity and large number of acute and chronic pain conditions preclude a general treatment algorithm. In cooperation with the World Health Organization, the International Association for the Study of Pain has developed a classification of chronic pain for the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases2 (Table 1), and a similar classification has been proposed for acute pain,5 providing the bases for facilitating treatment pathways.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms causing great personal distress and impairing social and occupational function. The societal burden from anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms of all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis on identification of the specific features of particular disorders. Need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, level of associated disability, impact on everyday life, presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatments. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics and patient and doctor preferences. There is much overlap between different anxiety disorders in evidence-based and effective therapies (e.g. prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or course of cognitive behavioural therapy), but there are important differences. It thus helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a discomfort and a kind of fear feeling of which individuals do not know the reasons but feel against the events which they regard dangerous and threatening. The indicator of anxiety in behaviors is a switch from the state of excessive excitement and activeness to sluggishness. Fear, nervousness, excessive anger, disgust, tiredness, muscle aches and psychological complaints are the most common indicators of the anxiety. “State anxiety” is permanent emotional reactions which the individual shows to the permanent states of which the density changes according to the conditions. “The state anxiety” level is high in the conditions which the individual comprehends the stressing state as threatening and it is low in the conditions which the danger is not comprehended as threatening. “State Anxiety” affects the sportsman’s motivation, concentration, coordination, the ability to determine, self-confidence, kondisyonel and coordinative abilities, which may be determinative on his/her performance. “State Anxiety” , which is occurred before or during the events that are called dangerous, is generally based on logical reasons and can be understood by other people. Trait anxiety is the perceiving the situations causing stress as a dangerous or threatening and the increasing and gaining continuity of the frequency and the density of emotional reactions against these threats. Trait anxiety is common and continuous anxiety which does not depend on a certain event or situation.. As the aim in sports competitions is based on probability of winning and losing, desire to have a good performance to be able to win sometimes creates negative impacts, and increasing complex emotions bring about the bad performance. Sports psychologists have consensus that it is necessary for the athletes to have a certain anxiety level for high performance. Lower or higher level affects the performance negatively. High anxiety level for the athletes is generally attained as the athletes come close to the borders of performance capacity. In other words, while coming close to the borders of performance capacity, anxiety density is increasing. If the athletes’ emotions are on the level of enthusiasm, horror or anger, many mental functions particularly thinking and perceiving get weak, and it is not possible to carry out activities consciously. To reach psycho-physic balance condition that a sportsman has, it is necessary to abolish the emotions. On the other hand, it is a big mistake to go on keeping the player on the game and expect a result. The physiological reactions which are shown by the people coming into anxiety process show themselves in the situations as difficulty in breathing, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, angriness, insomnia, anorexia or belly, smoking and using alcohol more, shirking his/her duty, ambivalence, amnesia, impatience, imbalance, having nightmare, gastric, infarction risk. When the individual is obstructed to reach incentive object, the individual blames the thing causing the obstruction. The individual has aggressiveness emotions against these obstructions.

Psychological conditions can occur at any age, and a person’s age is just one of many factors to be considered when assessing, formulating, and treating these complications. The commonest and most salient psychological conditions after stroke are anxiety, depression, fatigue, and emotionalism. Other more subtle presentations include low self-esteem, low confidence, reduced self-efficacy, altered identity, and post-traumatic stress. In approaching psychological conditions, it is important to be mindful that most are not limited to the acute phase. The delivery of psychological care is not necessarily the domain of specialists alone; service models such as stepped care may engage a range of staff in helping with less severe presentations. The ubiquitous nature of psychological conditions requires approaches that enable large numbers to be assessed and treated cost-effectively. Group-based approaches and self-management are particularly important additions to resource-intensive one–to-one therapy.",

      "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a condition characterized by the development of itchy wheals (hives), angioedema, or both, with reoccurring symptoms for more than 6 weeks. CSU is often fluctuating and unpredictable in its course,1 which is a great burden to the patients, especially when no underlying causes are found. Psychosomatic and psychiatric comorbidities are often reported and an association between CSU and stress was proposed, in which psychosocial strain may initiate a vicious cycle of stress-induced worsening of the disease causing a higher psychosocial burden, which in turn amplifies the stress influence on the disease.2-5 At present, systematic studies in support of a stress- and disease-relationship in CSU are largely missing, rendering the stress-contribution to CSU unclear. Comprehensive studies of the association between stress and urticaria are needed to answers to the following questions: Do CSU patients report relevant stress levels? Are stress levels higher when no underlying cause can be identified (CSU‒ CSU+ patients)? Do CSU‒ patients suffer from higher disease activity compared to CSU+ patients? And finally, are stress levels in CSU‒ and CSU+ patients linked to disease activity? To address these knowledge gaps, we studied stress perception and resilience and their association with disease severity, assessed by use of the urticaria activity score (UAS7) in an explorative manner. In addition, selected routinely assessed immune outcomes that have been discussed to play a role in stress effects in urticaria (IgE, basophils, eosinophils) were studied. The exploratory study was approved by ethics committee of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. A total of 303 CSU patients that provided informed written consent were assessed for mental distress, resilience, and immune outcomes (ELISA, complete blood count), and then, for potentially relevant underlying conditions, the results of which were disclosed to the patient after completion of the comprehensive workup of the etiologic tests by a team of experienced dermatologists (EMP, MM, MM). The scales \"worries,\" \"tension,\" \"and \"demands\" of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) were used to assess stress perception, \"joy\" and the Self-efficacy, Optimism and Pessimism (SWOP) questionnaire to assess resilience to stress.6, 7 PSQ \"summary score\" values above 50 are one SD (=17) higher, values below 16 are one SD lower than the mean (=33) in a German reference population,6 and were set as cutoffs for severe, medium and low stress, respectively. Additional data obtained included age, sex, body mass index, previous steroid- and anti-histamine intake. Investigated potentially relevant underlying clinical and laboratory conditions included autoreactivity, chronic viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, intolerance to food components, intolerance to physical provocation and chronic inflammatory diseases including autoimmune disorders and allergies. In 249 CSU patients, potentially relevant underlying conditions were identified (CSU+) as opposed to 54 patients without potentially relevant underlying conditions (CSU‒). Only a minority received oral medication prior to the assessment (antihistamines 20%, steroids 6%) and no medication or demographic differences were found between CSU+ and CSU‒ patients (Table S1). Levels of self-reported stress perception and resilience in CSU patients showed a wide range of mental distress levels, with low, moderate, and high PSQ scores in 21%, 64%, and 15% of patients, respectively. The mean PSQ \"summary score\" in women (32.05 ± 17.04, 72% of all patients) was slightly but not significantly higher than in men (29.82 ± 15.06). Patients younger than 45 years (55% of all patients) had slightly but not significantly higher PSQ \"summary score\" levels (33.12 ± 16.20) than older patients (29.55 ± 16.73). Chronic spontaneous urticaria‒ patients had significantly higher disease activity than CSU+ patients (Figure 1A). In CSU‒ patients, 52.6%, 31.6%, and 15.8% had UAS7 levels indicative of mild, moderate, and severe CSU, respectively, as compared to 64.2%, 25.8%, and 10% in CSU+ patients. CSU‒ patients reported higher PSQ \"worries,\" \"tension,\" and \"demands,\" with statistically increased values for the scale \"tension\" (Figure 1B,C, Table S2). In contrast, stress resilience in CSU‒ and CSU+ patients was similar. No group differences with respect to selected immunological measures such as total serum IgE, blood basophil and eosinophil counts were found (Table S3). Correlation analyses revealed that in CSU‒ patients, UAS7 scores showed a moderate positive correlation with the results of the PSQ-scales \"demands\" (r = .362; P = .028) and a trend for \"tension\" (r = .292; P = .0791) (Table 1). A regression analysis (including the confounders age, gender, and body mass index) confirmed these links in CSU‒ patients (adjusted R2 \"demands\" = 0.195; F(1/35) = 9.746; P = .004, Figure 1D; adjusted R2 \"tension\" = 0.082; F(1/35) = 4.218; P = .048, Figure 1E). The explained variance of 19.5% expresses a medium effect of f2 = 0.24 and of 8.2% a low effect of f2 = 0.09, respectively. By contrast, the common confounders age, gender, and body mass index were not significant predictors of the UAS7 in this group. Our comprehensive analyses of stress in patients with CSU are the first to demonstrate that most CSU patients report stress, but also that mean levels of mental distress are comparable to the general population.8 More importantly, our findings confirm that in CSU‒ perceived stress and disease activity are linked in the absence of demographic group differences and even before CSU‒ patients know that no underlying cause for their urticaria will be found. These observations are relevant and may help to destigmatize CSU patients, who often feel that their doctors and peers do not take their disease-burden seriously and attribute their suffering to the seemingly minor mental problem of having too much stress. In conclusion, our findings suggest a possible causal link between CSU and mental distress and encourage further research to confirm whether the increased levels of stress in the CSU‒ subpopulation are the reason or the result of their high disease levels. Clearly, in some CSU patients, the signs and symptoms of urticaria and stress are linked, which confirms the need to assess both the clinical symptoms and stress, ideally by daily diary-assessments and during patient visits, and also to address both by therapy and research, for example by the implementation of psychological interventions.

Suffering associated with acute pain is greatly influenced by the anxiety of the patient, and it can be managed by helping him form useful defensive attitudes toward the pain he will experience. Chronic pain, in contrast, tends to be linked to personality problems and payoffs in the home and job situation for adopting a sick role. Both pain states may be usefully construed as problems of perceptual distortion. A model for the perception of pain is presented and suggestions for applying psychological considerations in the diagnosis and management of pain states are offered.",

      "abstract": "The majority of first-episode psychoses are preceded by a prodromal phase that is several years on average, frequently leads to some decline in psychosocial functioning and offers the opportunity for early detection within the framework of an indicated prevention. To this, two approaches are currently mainly followed. The ultra-high-risk (UHR) criteria were explicitly developed to predict first-episode psychosis within 12 months, and indeed the majority of conversions in clinical UHR samples seem to occur within the first 12 months of initial assessment. Their main criterion, the attenuated psychotic symptoms criterion, captures symptoms that resemble positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) with the exception that some level of insight is still maintained, and these frequently compromise functioning already. In contrast, the basic symptom criteria try to catch patients at increased risk of psychoses at the earliest possible time, i.e. ideally when only the first subtle disturbances in information processing have developed that are experienced with full insight and do not yet overload the person's coping abilities, and thus have not yet resulted in any functional decline. First results from prospective studies not only support this view, but indicate that the combination of both approaches might be a more favorable way to increase sensitivity and detect risk earlier, as well as to establish a change-sensitive risk stratification approach.",

      "abstract": "Acute stress disorder is a psychiatric diagnosis that may occur in patients within four weeks of a traumatic event. Features include anxiety, intense fear or helplessness, dissociative symptoms, reexperiencing the event, and avoidance behaviors. Persons with this disorder are at increased risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder. Other risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder include current or family history of anxiety or mood disorders, a history of sexual or physical abuse, lower cognitive ability, engaging in excessive safety behaviors, and greater symptom severity one to two weeks after the trauma. Common reactions to trauma include physical, mental, and emotional symptoms. Persistent psychological distress that is severe enough to interfere with psychological or social functioning may warrant further evaluation and intervention. Patients experiencing acute stress disorder may benefit from psychological first aid, which includes ensuring the patient's safety; providing information about the event, stress reactions, and how to cope; offering practical assistance; and helping the patient to connect with social support and other services. Cognitive behavior therapy is effective in reducing symptoms and decreasing the future incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder. Critical Incident Stress Debriefing aims to mitigate emotional distress through sharing emotions about the traumatic event, providing education and tips on coping, and attempting to normalize reactions to trauma. However, this method may actually impede natural recovery by overwhelming victims. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of drugs in the treatment of acute stress disorder. Short-term pharmacologic intervention may be beneficial in relieving specific associated symptoms, such as pain, insomnia, and depression.",

      "abstract": "Breakthrough pain is a transient exacerbation of pain that occurs either spontaneously or in relation to a specific predictable or unpredictable trigger despite relative stable and adequately controlled background pain. Breakthrough pain is a common and distinct component of cancer pain and is typically of rapid onset, severe in intensity, and generally self-limiting with an average duration of 30-60minutes. Despite the self-limiting nature of breakthrough pain, it can place significant physical, psychological, and economic burdens on both patients and their carers. Patients with breakthrough pain are often less satisfied with their analgesic therapy, they have decreased functioning because of their pain, and may also experience social and psychosocial consequences, such as increased levels of anxiety and depression. Successful management of breakthrough pain is best achieved by a thorough assessment which includes determining the severity, pathophysiology, and aetiology of the pain and takes into account both background and breakthrough pains while considering whether the underlying disease, co-morbidities or precipitating events are amenable to interventions. The features of breakthrough pain and the challenges it presents to patients, their carers, and health professionals are illustrated with a case study.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Might a pleasure improve anhedonia and depression",
      "abstract": "Introduction Anhedonia (a reduction of the abil­ ity to feel pleasure) is considered a key symptom in major depression and may influence some of its most imp ortant symptoms, such as apathy, difficulty in concentrating and main­ taining attention, and gloomy mood. Various pleasurable sensations seem to be useful both in anhe donia and in depression. These pleasures are more intense than the usual daily ones, and their greater intensity could mean they can still be felt by a certain number of anhedonic individuals. Hypothesis Feeling a pleasant stimulus enhances the user’s sensitivity to subsequent rewards, so subsequent pleasures can be felt more strongly for a certain time. In this way, a pleasure strong enough to be still felt by some anhe­ donic individuals might reinforce their sensitivity to other rewards, enabling them to regain previously faded or lost pleasures, hence impro­ ving the anhedonia. Evaluation of Hypothesis Anhedonia is a key symptom of major depression and may influence some of its symptoms; hence an improve­ ment in anhedonia, produced by a pleasure strong enough to be felt, might positively influence the life of depressed people. Consequences of Hypothesis Since many symptoms of depression could be influenced by anhedonia, ameliorating anhedonia may alleviate also these symptoms of depression. Conclusion A pleasure, strong enough to be felt, might allow anhedonic and depressed persons to regain, for a certain time, previously lostnormal pleasures, thus enabling them to temporarily lead a more enjoyable life.",

      "abstract": "It is only in recent years that childhood depression has received widespread attention from mental health specialists. Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

      "abstract": "Primary care is an ideal environment in which health professionals can recognise the complex inter-relationship between physical and psychological symptoms. Patients commonly present with a variety of partially understood or poorly differentiated physical, psychological and social problems. A central role for GPs is to offer a degree of clarity about the nature and cause of such problems, and provide guidance on their management.\n\nExperiences of physical symptoms and depression raise complex issues about the distinctions between mind and body. While depression is commonly viewed as a disturbance of emotion, its behavioural aspects, such as social withdrawal or changes in eating behaviours, are equally important.\n\nHowever, these complexities are not always satisfactorily reflected in our clinical practice. Our diagnostic and conceptual frameworks, deriving both from our medical training and from classification systems such as ICD-10 and DSM-IV, are based on relatively narrow, dualistic perspectives. They encourage us to see problems as primarily either physical or psychological and to introduce comorbidity as a means of recognising some degrees of complexity — with the diagnosis of ‘medically unexplained’ symptoms serving as a back-stop to deal with those patients who do not present their symptoms in ways that we can readily formulate.\n\nTwo areas of diagnostic and therapeutic concern are the confusion between depressive and somatic symptoms, in chronic disease, and in particular the neglected relationship between pain and depression.\n\nIn chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for example, somatic symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia and weight loss may be simultaneously attributable to both the medical condition of COPD and to the psychiatric diagnosis of depression.1 This raises substantial risks of diagnostic confusion.

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "abstract": "Burnout has been viewed as a syndrome developing in response to chronically adverse working conditions. Burnout is thought to comprise emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Historically, however, burnout has been difficult to separate from depression. Indeed, the symptoms of burnout coincide with symptoms of depression. Evidence for the discriminant validity of burnout with regard to depression has been weak, both at an empirical and a theoretical level. Emotional exhaustion, the core of burnout, itself reflects a combination of depressed mood and fatigue/loss of energy and correlates very highly with other depressive symptoms. Work-related risk factors for burnout are also predictors of depression. Individual risk factors for depression (e.g., past depressive episodes) are also predictors of burnout. Overall, burnout is likely to reflect a \"classical\" depressive process unfolding in reaction to unresolvable stress.",

Much of the literature relating psychological stress and physiology has ignored how physiometrics—the reliability and validity of physiological parameters and biomarkers—might affect the estimation of relationships between these parameters and measures of stress. Acute physiological reactivity to experimental stress can serve as a meaningful predictor of future health outcomes and disease risk. Biomarkers used in studies of stress and other psychosocial variables have a wide range of variability. Cortisol, for example, does not generalize well from one day to the next, but if multiple days are collected at each time point, stability over weeks to months is low to moderate. Every study of stress physiology should use sufficiently reliable and generalizable measurement to avoid misestimation and both Type I and Type II errors.",

It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

Adolescence is a developmental period when emotions can be extreme when elicited by both positive and negative experiences. The major internalizing disorders are depressive disorders and anxiety disorders; related ones in this domain include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and autism. Treatment effectiveness for teenagers with substance use disorder and a coexisting internalizing disorder is optimized when both domains are addressed. Behavioral-based treatment approaches with concurrent psychotropic medication are part of the treatment plan. One of the most common mental and behavioral disorders among adolescents in the United States is depression. For those suffering from a major depressive disorder, symptoms include a period of at least 2 weeks of a very persistent low mood accompanied with low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, and problems with sleep, energy, and concentration.",

      "title": "Depression in der Rheumatologie",
      "abstract": "Depression is due to a diseased state of a central resonance system controlling our mental and autonomous functions. This regulatory system is essentially involved in communicating with our surroundings. As far as its reactivity is concerned, it can be patterned and programmed with certain behavioural models originating in early childhood. The system is responsible for our feeling tone and can be influenced by both physical disorders and by emotional stress.Depression can result in a fatal spiral depending on the prepatterned tendency to react either more sensitively and vulnerably or more on the aggressive side. Vulnerability is enhanced, the sensitivity to e.g. noise or stress is increased. For example, mothers are apt to be the first persons to complain about the fact that children have become too boisterous, whereas husbands realize that this is symptomatic of a depressive mood.This is followed by a retreat as a kind of protection against enhanced vulnerability, a retreat the relatives fail to understand: ». . . You don't take any interest - you no longer react to what I say; you have ceased to impart stimuli.«After the disturbed approach to aggressivity, the patient shows irritated excitement and enhanced inner tension, inner unrest. This is again interlinked with musculature: the excitement, which has not been sufficiently discharged, leads to muscular tension and eventually to myogeloses and insertion tendopathy.Of course, the human psyche cannot be explained solely by means of chemistry of the brain or by means of amplification systems or any combination of such processes. Hence, depressive and affective disorders cannot be treated on a biochemical basis only. All we can do is to try to understand the subjective side of the patient's experience during his depressive phase, and to help him on the basis of our understanding of this depressive mood. Not only the extent of psychosocial stress and its contribution towards triggering the depression make it mandatory for us to understand the patient's problems; in equal measure, the suffering of the depressed patient who is aware of his condition requires a special approach to his mental disorder. Since depression is made up of physicobiological as well as mental disturbances, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy must always act jointly.With regard to the complex of depression in rheumatology, therefore, attention must be paid to the following interrelations:1. Depression can be produced in many different ways. A depression can be associated with syndromes of pain in the muscular and skeletal system via cerebral nuclearspecific imbalance through the disturbances in nuclear regions regulating muscular tone. Such syndromes appear chiefly as syndromes of the cervical vertebral column and lumbar vertical column and as general »non-specific pain syndromes«.2. Depressive moods may cause manifestation of rheumatic complaints previously latent due to lowering of the pain threshold.3. Conversely, chronic physical diseases or sudden motor impediments (e.g. in acute and chronic rheumatic diseases) may be assumed to produce depression via common afferent structures.4. Masked depression can assume the pattern of a rheumatic pain syndrome and can be treated as such for a long time purely somatically, i.e. non-specifically (Fig. 6).",

      "abstract": "Many GPs find the care of patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) challenging. Therefore, the WONCA Working Party for Primary Mental Health asked for MUS guidance for family doctors worldwide in order to improve the care of patients with MUS globally. This article is a summary of this guidance.\n\nMUS are physical symptoms that have existed for several weeks and for which adequate medical examination or investigation have not revealed any condition that sufficiently explains the symptoms. MUS is a working hypothesis based on the (justified) assumption that somatic or psychiatric pathology have been adequately detected and treated, but that the clinical condition presented by the patients was not adequately resolved. Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS.1 For some patients with physical symptoms, a somatic or psychiatric condition may be present. However, if the physical symptoms are more severe or more persistent, or limit functioning to a greater extent than expected based on the condition in question, they too are referred to as MUS.\n\nMUS can be seen as a continuum ranging from self-limiting symptoms to recurrent and/or persisting symptoms and symptom disorders. The group with recurrent and/or persisting symptoms is especially relevant in primary care as these …",

      "abstract": "Dissociative disorders are heterogeneous group of mental disorders with dissociation as dominant symptoms. Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

During preparation for competitions of various levels, the Olympic Games, world championships, continental championships, city competitions, athletes are \"accompanied\" by mental and emotional tension. Accordingly, when being in a given state of stress, corresponding negative disturbances appear in the performed sports activity. In general, stress is a fairly common and common phenomenon. Minor stresses are inevitable and harmless, but excessive stress creates problems for both individuals and organizations in accomplishing tasks. Psychologists believe that a person suffers more and more often from insults inflicted on him, a sense of his own insecurity, uncertainty about the future. There are two main groups of stress factors that most significantly affect the results of sports activities and are most often encountered: pre-competitive and competitive. Competitive stressors are stressors related directly to the sporting situation the athlete finds themselves in. Essentially, they are the most obvious stressors and are most directly linked to what happens during training or in a game. Organizational stressors can be attributed to, and therefore solved by, the coaching and organizational set up surrounding a team. The athlete needs to be helped to identify actions aimed at improving performance. Success in reaching sports peaks depends on the individual psychological characteristics of the athlete, and certain types of sports make demands and at the same time form personal qualities that are necessary for successful competitive activities. Each athlete is different, and their response to these competitive stressors will vary too. Finding the sweet spot where these stressors are contributing to an engaged, locked-in mindset can be the difference come crunch time. Knowing when a competitive stressor is overwhelming an athlete and having a detrimental affect can be an important preventative measure to avoid further issues down the road.",

Rarely can a definite injury be determined in the acute (or chronic) phase. Crash-related factors have been identified, and several trauma mechanisms possibly causing different injuries have been described. Most whiplash trauma will not cause injury, and the majority of patients (92-95%) will return to work. Litigation is not a major factor. Cognitive impairments are not the same as brain injury. Variables such as pain intensity, restricted motion, neurological symptoms and signs, together with central nervous system symptoms can be used to predict a situation with risk of remaining complaints. Influences of other factors--the same as for other chronic pain conditions--also exist. Persistent/chronic pain is not merely acute pain that persists over time; changes occur at different levels of the pain transmission system. Chronic whiplash-associated disorders are associated with problems concerning social functioning, daily anxieties and satisfaction with different aspects of life. Adequate information, advice and pain medication together with active interventions might be more effective in the acute stage. Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation focusing on cognitive-behavioural changes might be of value.

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "abstract": "Depression can occur in association with virtually all the other psychiatric and physical diagnoses. Physical illness increases the risk of developing severe depressive illness. There are two broadly different mechanisms. The most obvious has a psychological or cognitive mechanism. Thus, the illness may provide the life event or chronic difficulty that triggers a depressive episode in a vulnerable Individual. Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease. Finally major depression, but especially minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms merge with other manifestations of human distress with which patients present to their doctors, Such somatic presentations test the conventional distinction between physical and mental disorder, and are a perennial source of controversy.",

The components of chronic pain can be conceptualised as disability ( somatic components) interacting with distress (affective, cognitive and behavioural components). Studies show that the major factors associated with the development of chronic spinal pain are not somatic, but instead are psychosocial. Precise anatomical ' diagnosis' in chronic musculoskeletal pain is elusive. Recognition of the development of neuropathic pain is possible on clinical grounds. Non- nociceptive sources of distress may arise out of reactions to the experience of pain and can be influenced by mood, by beliefs and by society. Chronicity may be prevented by minimising the cognitive and behavioural effects of inappropriate patient labelling and treatment, by early attention to treating the symptom itself, and by recognition of neuropathic processes and of non-nociceptive sources of distress.

      "title": "Post‐traumatic stress disorder as moderator of other mental health conditions",
      "abstract": "The comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a range of other mental disorders is common. This comorbidity is often attributed to either overlapping symptoms between PTSD and other disorders or to the variety of psychiatric conditions that can arise in the wake of exposure to a traumatic experience. However, this comorbidity may also be due to the fact that PTSD can moderate the onset or severity of other psychiatric symptoms or disorders. This is an important issue, because it has implications for how patients affected by the array of symptoms that can emerge after trauma may be most efficiently managed. Our knowledge of how PTSD can impact other disorders rests on longitudinal studies that have assessed PTSD and other conditions, and have typically conducted cross-lagged or time-series analyses. This approach allows us to determine the extent to which each condition impacts other disorders at later assessments. Convergent evidence indicates that PTSD can precede or exacerbate depression, anxiety disorders, suicidality, substance abuse, eating disorders, and psychosis1. Furthermore, PTSD can precede a range of physical and behavioral indicators, including chronic pain and tobacco use. There is also evidence from network analysis indicating how symptoms of PTSD may impact other psychiatric symptoms. Network analysis conceptualizes psychopathological states as resulting from causal paths between different symptoms – rather than emerging from an underlying disease state2, 3. For example, the PTSD symptom of nightmares may play a causal role in contributing to sleep disturbance, which in turn leads to concentration deficits and irritability. Numerous studies using network analysis have shown that specific PTSD symptoms can influence problems across other conditions, including depression and anx­iety disorders4. In explaining the role of PTSD as a mediator of the relationship between trauma exposure and onset of other psychiatric disorders, there are several mechanisms that can be considered, and these arguably function in an interactive manner. One key potential mechanism is the impact of PTSD on the capacity to down-regulate emotional distress. It is well documented that PTSD involves impaired emotion regulation, and it is possible that this impairment predisposes people to develop new psychiatric disorders or worsens others5. The capacity to regulate emotions in PTSD can be related to the well-documented deficits in executive functioning6. Deficient working memory and attentional capacity can limit the extent to which one can regulate emotions, which can result in greater risk for mental health problems. Moreover, avoidance is a key symptom of PTSD, and this can trigger a cascade of strategies that can be maladaptive. Avoidance can involve situations or thoughts and memories related to the traumatic experience. This tendency can generalize to more pervasive avoidance of social networks, emotional states, and activities that promote good mental health. This can lead to a worsening of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions. Another common form of avoidance for people with PTSD is self-medicating with prescription or non-prescription substances to numb the distress that is experienced along with traumatic memories. This behaviour can not only lead to substance abuse, which has been documented in longitudinal studies of PTSD, but also facilitate other psychiatric problems, because issues may not be addressed in a constructive manner. Avoidance tendencies can also result in not seeking help from mental health services, which can impede early intervention or adequate treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The DSM-5 explicitly recognizes the presence of harmful behaviors in PTSD, including such risk-taking behaviors as dangerous driving, severe alcohol use, and self-harm. These reactions are conceptualized as a result of the extreme arousal and the difficulties in impulse control that can be experienced by people with PTSD7. These behaviors can lead to a range of events and habits triggering repetitive cycles of exposure to trauma. This can compound the sensitization that has been reported in PTSD, in which the condition results in neural sensitivity to threats and stressors in one's environment, such that the person is more reactive to these events. One of the strongest transdiagnostic predictors of risk for mental health problems is represented by maladaptive or catastrophic appraisals about oneself or the environment8. A key feature of PTSD is the tendency to engage in catastrophic appraisals after the traumatic experience, and these appraisals can generalize to many aspects of a person's life, such as one's self-esteem, trust in others, fears of negative evaluations, germs, or self-blame. These cognitive tendencies are major risk factors for an array of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Relatedly, the tendency to ruminate is well documented after trauma, and this habit of repeatedly thinking about negative events is a major risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. In considering these various mechanisms for how PTSD can moderate other psychiatric problems, it is worth noting that many of the risk factors reviewed here may be present prior to trauma exposure, and in fact predispose the person to developing PTSD. These elements can be intensified as PTSD develops, and then contribute to other psychiatric conditions which have a shared vulnerability. In this context, it is especially worth recognizing the emerging evidence on shared genetic vulnerabilities to a range of psychiatric disorders9. In the wake of trauma exposure and PTSD development, gene expression can predispose an individual to develop other psychiatric disorders by means of the shared genetic vulnerability. Overall, this evidence reflects the interactive multifactorial nature of the processes explaining how PTSD can lead to the onset or worsening of other psychiatric conditions. Understanding how PTSD can impact on other psychological problems is an important area of future research, because it has important treatment implications. Targeting PTSD may have downstream benefits for many problems beyond the specific domain of that disorder.",

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review. In this review, we provide an update of recent studies on the age of onset (AOO) of the major mental disorders, with a special focus on the availability and use of services providing prevention and early intervention. Recent findings. The studies reviewed here confirm previous reports on the AOO of the major mental disorders. Although the behaviour disorders and specific anxiety disorders emerge during childhood, most of the high-prevalence disorders (mood, anxiety and substance use) emerge during adolescence and early adulthood, as do the psychotic disorders. Early AOO has been shown to be associated with a longer duration of untreated illness, and poorer clinical and functional outcomes. Summary. Although the onset of most mental disorders usually occurs during the first three decades of life, effective treatment is typically not initiated until a number of years later. There is increasing evidence that intervention during the early stages of disorder may help reduce the severity and/or the persistence of the initial or primary disorder, and prevent secondary disorders. However, additional research is needed on effective interventions in early-stage cases, as well as on the long-term effects of early intervention, and for an appropriate service design for those with emerging mental disorders. This will mean not only the strengthening and re-engineering of existing systems, but is also crucial the construction of new streams of care for young people in transition to adulthood.",

Up to 60% of these patients is also suffering from psychosocial problems. Therefore it is important to define the patient's complaints in terms of a biopsychosocial disorder, to acknowledge the relevance of the psychosocial aspects and to provide an integrated psychosomatic treatment or a psychotherapy if indicated. Most of the research on psychotherapy in FGID to date has focused on the irritable bowel syndrome and different methods of treatments were studied (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and relaxation). Randomised controlled studies have shown that psychotherapy is superior to conventional medical therapy. Hypnotherapy is successful not only for irritable bowel syndrome but also for functional dyspepsia. Predictors of a positive response to psychological treatment generally are: (1) awareness that stress exacerbates their bowel symptoms, (2) at least mild anxiety or depression, (3) the predominant bowel symptom is abdominal pain or diarrhea and not constipation, (4) the abdominal pain waxes and wanes in response to eating, defecation, or stress rather than being constant pain, and 5) the symptoms are of relatively short duration.

At the heart of many of these outcomes is the stress process, which under acute conditions can be considered adaptive and essential for survival. To be sure, stress due to trauma is a normal response, despite the fact that emotional and psychophysiological processes may be at abnormal levels for a period of time. Disordered responses may follow an event which is outside the realm of normal human experience and which involves extreme threat or privation, including natural disasters, humanmade events such as war, fires, airplane crashes, chemical, nuclear, or toxic accidents, and more individual level traumas such as victimization by crime, rape, or automobile accidents. The vast majority of victims of these events experience only transient symptoms and recover readily. However, some victims appear to experience long-lasting stress following some kinds of trauma. Under some conditions, stress appears to persist and may form the basis of PTSD. In such cases, abnormal levels of response persist for abnormally long periods of time. Davidson and Baum (1986) suggested that situations which are not necessarily intense, but which pose lasting threats, may be associated with persistent symptoms of stress, arid that these chronic stress reactions are very similar to posttraumatic stress disorder, and may differ only in the intensity of the symptoms.",

It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously.

We also evaluate the research on the validity and limitations of ASD as a diagnosis, the relationship between peritraumatic dissociation and other symptomatology, the extent to which PTSD is predicted by previous ASD or peritraumatic dissociation, and other important issues such as impairment and risk factors related to ASD. We conclude with our recommendations for changes in DSM-5 criteria and the development of more sophisticated research that considers ASD as but one of two or possibly three common acute posttraumatic syndromes.",

      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but has never become part of the standard nomenclature. This entity is characterized by acute onset, often following the occurrence of an emotionally disturbing event, absence of any characteristic thought disturbance, and affectivity changes in the direction of volatility. Its manifestations can also include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and behavior disorders. Though the acute episode seldom lasts from one to three weeks, it has good prognosis and there is practically no residue after the symptoms disappear. A review about the evolution and the actual interest and adequacy of this clinical entity. The very existence of hysterical psychosis as a diagnostic entity has been questioned as part of the general difficulty in defining both hysteria and psychosis. A non-systematic review of PubMed articles. The hysterical psychosis occurs in patients with a hysterical personality / histrionic, with more colorful psychotic symptoms, which are somehow characteristic. This seems to condition the definition of a well defined nosological entity, as long as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. It still seems questionable whether the concept of hysterical psychosis should be kept as an entity with well-defined etiologic determinants, however in clinical terms this approach may have advantages.",

      "abstract": "The concept of a serotonin (5-HT)-related, anxiety and/or aggression-driven, stressor-precipitated depression is formulated and discussed. The serotonergic disturbances found in some depressed individuals, particularly those with lowered CSF 5-HIAA, are linked to the anxiety and aggression components of the depressive syndrome. In this type of depression, called 5-HT-related depression, dysregulation of anxiety and/or aggression is hypothesized to be primordial and mood-lowering is a derivative phenomenon. In other words, this is a group of anxiety/aggression-driven depressions. The author submits that the serotonergic impairment in certain types of depression is a trait phenomenon, i.e. it persists during remission. This disturbance makes the individual susceptible to perturbation of anxiety and aggression regulation. Anxiety and (overt or suppressed) anger are core constituents of the stress syndrome. Thus the serotonergic disturbance will induce a heightend sensitivity to stressful events, i.e. the latter will induce stress phenomena, including anxiety and anger, more readily than normal. The latter psychological features induce lowering of mood, and thus 'drive' the patient into a full-blown depression. Furthermore, it is predicted that anxiolytics and serenics (i.e. anti-aggressive drugs) that act via normalization of serotonergic circuits will exert an antidepressant effect in 5-HT related depression, in addition to their therapeutic actions in anxiety disorders and states of increased aggressiveness, respectively. The exact nature of the serotonergic impairment in 5-HT-related depression has yet to be elucidated.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a maladaptive, pathological response to a traumatic event which is currently underdiagnosed and undertreated. This results in part from a lack of awareness regarding the prevalence of the disorder. It has been estimated that at least one third of the general population will be exposed to severe trauma throughout their lifetime, out of which approximately 10 % to 20 % develop PTSD. A prevalence of 3 % to 6 % of PTSD in the general population, found in several studies, corresponds well with these figures. Both the type of trauma and the personal characteristics of the individual involved are associated with the probability of developing PTSD. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed (DSM-IV) gives four diagnostic criteria: (i) exposure and emotional response to a traumatic event; (ii) reexperiencing; (iii) avoidance; and (iv) increased physiological arousal, along with severe impairment in occupational, social, and interpersonal functioning. The rate of comorbidity with other mental disorders is high, particularly for major depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. Different types of psychological intervention, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and a host of pharmacological interventions, have been tried. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are currently the most widely researched agents with consistent, though modest, therapeutic effects. Other compounds, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have also been found to be effective, although their use is limited due to side effects. PTSD is a psychobiological phenomenon in response to psychological trauma, which represents maladaptive neurobiological deregulation and psychological dysfunction, and awaits further recognition and research.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mental health problems often involve clusters of symptoms that include subjective (conscious) experiences as well as behavioral and/or physiological responses. Because the bodily responses are readily measured objectively, these have come to be emphasized when developing treatments and assessing their effectiveness. On the other hand, the subjective experience of the patient reported during a clinical interview is often viewed as a weak correlate of psychopathology. To the extent that subjective symptoms are related to the underlying problem, it is often assumed that they will be taken care of if the more objective behavioral and physiological symptoms are properly treated. Decades of research on anxiety disorders, however, show that behavioral and physiological symptoms do not correlate as strongly with subjective experiences as is typically assumed. Further, the treatments developed using more objective symptoms as a marker of psychopathology have mostly been disappointing in effectiveness. Given that “mental” disorders are named for, and defined by, their subjective mental qualities, it is perhaps not surprising, in retrospect, that treatments that have sidelined mental qualities have not been especially effective. These negative attitudes about subjective experience took root in psychiatry and allied fields decades ago when there were few avenues for scientifically studying subjective experience. Today, however, cognitive neuroscience research on consciousness is thriving, and offers a viable and novel scientific approach that could help achieve a deeper understanding of mental disorders and their treatment.",

      "title": "Anxiety and Separation Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are the emotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identified as threatening or scary. Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and they change throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinking manifestations of fear and anxiety.Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fear response is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs when there is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stress response in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk of both physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present to their primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reporting anxiety. Parents also may report significant changes in behavior, with increased opposition and tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety.Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents, affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be as early as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantial impairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, but most adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause family distress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreated anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includes decreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationship outcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medical illnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this finding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons children develop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physiologic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute. Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood, (3) but many children have no identifiable predisposing factors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individuals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depression and anxiety have a significant influence on attachment, affecting the early environment and brain development of children. Maternal depression and anxiety can influence appropriate emotion regulation and stress responses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatric illnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psychosocial stressors, including school issues, social difficulties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contribute to anxiety disorders.Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to the survival of human beings, involving fright/flight neurobiology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensory input (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus), and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often referred to as components of the limbic system. This system is activated under stress and danger and prepares the body physiologically by activating the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate this response in the brain and to modify fear responses.In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overresponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriate response modulation. The release of stress hormones and adrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (given the situation) without appropriate regulation causes the feelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg, stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias, chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying, trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassurance all are common manifestations of anxiety. The avoidance and reliance on others to help manage fears may help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can become extreme and interfere with functioning at home, school, and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time.Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specific situations or environments and for others can be more generalized. It is important to distinguish between appropriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usually lasting for many months), interferes substantially with functioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude of the stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adaptive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change or transition (eg, starting school) and are expected responses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usually require intervention by a clinician; stress usually is of short duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely to resolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated by social support or environmental modification alone.Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia are the most common childhood anxiety disorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Several anxiety disorder screening tools have been well validated for use in children and adolescents. The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent and self-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders in youth. These three scales are helpful for identifying youth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoring response to treatment. (6)Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anxiety is a normal stage of early development in preschoolers and during the initial few months of first attending school. It is considered a disorder if it continues past these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional developmental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety disorder fear something bad will happen to them or someone they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they are apart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sight from the parent or caregiver or to have substantial distress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipation of separation. By definition, the duration of the anxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms can manifest as physical complaints on school mornings that usually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behavior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if the feared situation (eg, school) is avoided.Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fall asleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or they sleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affected child demands substantial attention and time, which can lead to less parental time for other children in the family. Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which can result in a parent-child dyad that can exclude other members of the family to manage the child's anxiety. The child becomes dependent on the mother for reassurance and management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losing confidence in his or her ability to manage situations independently.Parents of children who have separation anxiety describe loss of their adult relationships and occupational consequences because at least one parent is home with the child who has not gone to school. Children who have separation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportunities with friends because they do not want to be away from their home and parents. This disorder can cause substantial distress and dysfunction for the child and family and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One of the important functional impairments commonly associated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal. (7)School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or high distress associated with going to school. Although it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can be a symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most commonly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is a complex problem that requires genuine understanding of individual and family factors to develop a successful treatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder is getting the child back into the school environment as soon as possible.It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy. Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report other symptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents. They are not at school, but the reason is not that they need to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear and anxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skipping school, lack of concern or embarrassment about not attending school, refusal to do any school work, and frequently hiding school absences from parents.Specific phobia is the most common type of anxiety disorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of the specific feared situation and less often presents for treatment. Many people have fears, with common ones including heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles. A specific phobia is fear of an object or situation that is not developmentally expected and is out of proportion to the actual danger and manifests as an anxiety response that is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or intense anxiety and panic). The specific fear must be present for at least 6 months and cause the child substantial distress or impairment in functioning to be considered a true phobia. Although many specific phobias do not come to medical attention, fear of needles in a child requiring vaccination and fear of choking with restriction of oral intake are two examples of situations requiring treatment due to associated health risks. Specific phobias sometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such as becoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog). Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition, increased stress in the environment, and modeling behaviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear response to a situation).Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of the increased importance of peers and social context in adolescent development. Youth who suffer from social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that is extremely distressing and can lead to avoidance and substantial deterioration in overall function. Youth who have social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelming fear of drawing attention to themselves or saying something stupid or embarrassing around others, especially peers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask questions in class, not being able to talk in front of others, avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disorder can result in isolation to the point of rarely leaving home, not having contact with friends, and not attending school.Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in childhood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers around everyday events and responsibilities in the child's life, such as school, friends, health, future, and finances, but the distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or unhelpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children may report feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscle aches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating due to the intensity and chronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affected individuals may have academic performance anxiety that interferes with starting and completing assignments and taking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will not be good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop to prevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessive reassurance from others that nothing bad will happen, leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, and avoidance of everyday activities.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusive thoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxiety associated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, cause substantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (consuming more than 1 hour per day). The most common obsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning, washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does not always involve observed compulsions, and the individual can suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, of violent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremely distressing. Children who have OCD generally have poor insight into their illness and may not recognize the obsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may have trouble going to school, find they are unable to concentrate in class, have difficulty getting out of the house or getting dressed, and have decreased food intake related to obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly are involved in OCD routines and compulsions with children and teens, and the illness can have a substantial negative impact on family functioning.Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent years but can occur in children. Although not the most common anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitating rapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) most commonly present initially to an emergency department or urgent care center because the physical symptoms are acute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heart attack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panic attacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stress situation when the patient is presented with a feared stimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur \"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning. Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxiety about having another attack, particularly in a place where others might see them or where escape or help might not be possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation they associate with having a panic attack as well as places where they fear that if they did have an attack they would not be able to manage it or get help. Teens who have panic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, refuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stop going to school (or have extreme distress with school attendance).Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents is one of the best-researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includes both specific and nonspecific treatment approaches. Specific approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders and include structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Nonspecific treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, including sleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predictable routine, and social supports.Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as first-line treatment for children who have anxiety disorders when this therapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs and books are available, and the skills often are taught to both parents and child to support the implementation of the strategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxious behaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavior skills training to help individuals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxious children think catastrophically or overexaggerate the negative outcomes of situations and generate avoidant solutions, leading to significant distress and avoidance behaviors.The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety, developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Behavioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress management techniques as well as gradual exposure to the feared situation to modify the anxiety response through systematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3). Many children experience improvement in their anxiety with CBT alone and do not require medication. In some cases, children and teens are unable to learn and use CBT strategies to manage their anxiety without pharmacologic treatment.Medications help decrease overall anxiety symptoms and panic response and should be considered if the anxiety is moderate to severe. The best evidence, supported by both meta-analyses (10) and a Cochrane review, (11) for pharmacologic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9) Although some SSRIs have been approved for treating children who have depression (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and OCD (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), SSRIs do not have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, considerable evidence supports their efficacy. CBT in combination with an SSRI is recommended for moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders. (9)(12) Randomized, controlled trials of SSRI medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) show effectiveness in treating children and adolescents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11)Evidence is insufficient to recommend non-SSRI antidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence supports the efficacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD, but the adverse effect profile does not support its use as first-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have been used for acute management of anxiety, but there is no evidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxiety disorders in children. (9)(11)The risk/benefit ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverse effects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA black box warning for all antidepressants (the rare but increased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideation and behaviors while taking antidepressant medications). Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual increases, as tolerated, according to symptom response and adverse effects, remembering that the medications take several weeks to start working and improvement continues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not as common in childhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child decrease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learning and using anxiety management strategies. Given the adverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in children and the limited long-term safety data of these medications in the developing brain, medication intervention should be combined with CBT and healthy living strategies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off the medication within 1 year if he or she is doing well.Anxiety has the best chance of improving when both youth and family are educated about anxiety disorders and when there is support of the treatment plan. Numerous randomized, controlled trials support CBT and SSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is widely accepted as a leading feature of that illness designated by the number 301.1 in the International Classification of Diseases. The name given varies—“endogenous depression”, “manic-depressive psychosis/depressive type”, “melancholia” or “depressive illness”. The present generation of laymen (not to say some psychiatrists) use the word “depression” so freely in order to describe an unpleasant, unhappy mood, whether lasting or transient, that one may prefer the term melancholia, or at least “depressive illness”, to signify that condition which justifies the number 301.1. The adjective “endogenous” implies for many that environmental stress plays little or no part in the onset of the illness; we cannot accept that this is always so. The term “reactive” is used in several ways, generally to indicate that the state of unhappiness arises out of some external circumstance and that it would end when circumstances improved or the individual accepted the realities of practical life. The patients used in the present study were suffering from an illness of a kind which we believe may sometimes develop in the absence of severe environmental stress, while in others it may be clearly provoked by circumstances, but the illness, as it develops, may take on a form which becomes largely independent of the environmental circumstances and may continue even when the provoking factors are past; it has become an autonomous melancholia. It will be apparent that by autonomous melancholia we mean an illness shown by clinical experience to respond especially well to electroplexy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acute stress disorder (ASD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by exposure to a traumatic event followed by symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-arousal, peritraumatic dissociation, and impairment in functioning. ASD's time-limited duration (two days to one month) makes it distinct from but related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed after one month. ASD's brief duration has contributed to a dearth of large-scale, population-based studies. Smaller studies have sought to determine rates of ASD after specific events in select populations; others have focused on ASD's role in predicting PTSD. Much can be learned from existing epidemiological studies. ASD's prevalence varies from 3% in a population of accident victims to 59% in female sexual assault victims. Female gender is a key risk factor; marital status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status have also been associated with ASD in some studies. Comorbidities include depressive and anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.",

      "abstract": "Pain is a complex, distressing sensory and emotional experience directly associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Short-term pain serves a protective signaling function; however, under prolonged action of pathogenic factors and dysfunction of the nociceptive system, acute pain responses can transform into a pathological state. This state is characterized by a persistent pain syndrome lasting beyond normal healing time (usually more than 3–6 months), leading to the development of Chronic Pain Syndrome (CPS) and Chronic Post-Traumatic Pain (CPTP). These phenomena entail complex negative consequences: persistent physiological shifts, significant functional limitations, neurological disorders, and various mental disorders. Chronic Pain Syndrome has a profoundly negative impact on all aspects of patients’ quality of life. A critically important aspect is its ability to significantly hinder the rehabilitation process. The present article details the clinical phenomena of CPS and CPTP, analyzes their specific impact on the psychoemotional status and, consequently, on patients’ rehabilitation potential. Scientific data is presented demonstrating how various negative factors of the pain syndrome directly impede the implementation of therapeutic measures, reduce treatment adherence, and diminish the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs in patients who have suffered various injuries. The article also describes the influence of attachment style on patients’ individual experience of pain and introduces the hypothesis that rehabilitation of such patients might be possible using psychological techniques aimed at strengthening self-identity of self. The article emphasizes the necessity of a comprehensive treatment approach integrating pain management and psychological intervention.",

      "title": "Acute stress reactions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Exceptionally stressful life events can cause severe psychological symptoms, including anxiety, feelings of derealization and depersonalization, and hyperarousal. In one of the first studies to comprehensively document acute reactions to extreme stress, Lindemann observed that the symptoms reported by survivors of the Coconut Grove Fire included avoidance, re-experiencing scenes from the fire, reports of derealization, and the experience of anxiety when exposed to reminders of the event. Similarly, acute responses reported by soldiers who fought in the First and Second World Wars included re-experiencing symptoms and dissociative responses such as numbing, amnesia, and depersonalization. The International Classification of Diseases has recognized acute stress reactions since 1948 (ICD-6). In the most recent edition (ICD-10), early reactions to exceptionally stressful life events are diagnosed as acute stress reaction, one of the diagnoses in the section headed ‘reactions to severe stress, and adjustment disorders’. The diagnoses of acute stress reactions in ICD-10 and of acute stress disorder in DSM-IV have similarities in that they are caused by extreme stress and have some overlap in symptom patterns. They can be considered as two separate points on a continuum from transient to more enduring symptoms. However, there are also differences in the underlying concepts, as we will discuss in this chapter.",

It is related to decrements in physical health, indicated by presence of symptoms and illnesses, and use of medical services. Furthermore, bereaved individuals report diverse psychological reactions. For a few people, mental disorders or complications in the grieving process ensue. We summarise research on risk factors that increase vulnerability of some bereaved individuals. Diverse factors (circumstances of death, intrapersonal and interpersonal variables, ways of coping) are likely to co-determine excesses in ill-health. We also assess the eff ectiveness of psychological intervention programmes. Intervention should be targeted at high-risk people and those with complicated grief or bereavement-related depression and stress disorders.",

Gender is a strong predictor of post-traumatic anxiety and de­pres­­sive disorders. A second robust predictor of disaster men­tal health outcomes in individuals is represented by pre­exis­ting psychiatric disorders.

Our case is a 22-year-old female born of a consanguineous marriage, with the appearance of CDD symptoms in her fifth year of age following normal mental and physical development during her initial four years of life. Without any precipitating factor, she gradually lost her language abilities, social relational skills, affectionate behavior, adaptive capacities, peer play and meaningful interest in her surrounding, friends and family members over a period of 4 years, reaching a plateau in her ninth year of age. The unique special clinical symptom in this case is a seasonal total mutism, which after the beginning of her CDD symptoms is revealing every year covering the spring. As no additional physical or psychological change accompanies her total seasonal speech loss, it cannot be attributed to any mental condition known as having a seasonal pattern. Because in the literature CDD is presented mostly as case reports with lacking of advanced research data, describing any new case is recommended to improve the knowledge about this rare condition, especially if it displays some new unusual signs, not reported till now.",

      "abstract": "Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se , they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.",

      "abstract": "The term \"illness\" implies a medical disease model, namely that symptoms or syndromes indicate an underlying organic disease - in the case of psychiatry a disorder of the brain. But no brain markers could be identified until today, which would indicate a psychiatric illness or in particular a certain psychiatric illness. Furthermore organic causes of a mental disorder are an exclusion criterion for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. For all these reasons all international classifications systems use the term \"disorder\" instead of \"illness\". Beyond the question if mental disorders are disorders of the brain one might challenge the concept of psychiatric diagnoses at all. Most diagnostic thresholds are arbitrary or imposed on pragmatic grounds. For a categorical diagnosis to be scientifically valid, clear symptom boundaries should separate it from other conditions. But this is rarely the case concerning psychiatric diagnoses. In many respects a dimensional approach would be much more appropriate than a categorical view. A dimensional approach would reflect the fact that mental problems are part of the human condition, which turn into psychiatric disorders when the affected individual cannot perform his or her social roles any longer. The personal, social and environmental factors that determine mental health and mental illness may be clustered conceptually around themes like the development and maintenance of healthy communities and each person's ability to deal with the social world and manage his or her life. All this would be much more helpful than the conceptualisation of mental disorders as brain diseases.",

      "abstract": "Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman affected by abnormal, excessive and involuntary reactions to harmless and unexpected sensory stimuli, compatible with the diagnosis of hyperekplexia. It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis and, even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father’s side manifested the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50 perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it therapies were resorted which, however, involve cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic test has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to the condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well known and presenting symptoms which are easily confused with other more common diseases, in the absence of clinical-diagnostic tools at the present time.",

It consists of two opposite states, manic state and depressive state. Typical manic symptoms include a pathologic delightful mood, flight of ideas, heightened level of activity and sexual interest. Grandiosity, rapid and pressured speech, increased energy and decreased need for sleep are also frequently seen. On the other hand, depressive symptoms are characterized by prolonged depressive mood, inhibition of thought, lowered level of activity, depressive ideas or delusions and various somatic dysfunctions such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance. Mood disorders are often seen in association with organic brain diseases, collagen diseases such as SLE, some endocrinological diseases and medication. Diagnosis of manic or depressive states is usually carried out by careful psychiatric interviews. No specific somatic symptoms or signs have been identified for manic-depressive illness.

Delusional thinking may occur in severe cases. Behaviourally, depression reflects helplessness or appeasement that arise from feelings of inferiority, entrapment, or defeat. Non-verbal behaviour in depression resembles ancient strategies of vertebrates to signal submission. At the cognitive level, people with depression often engage in ruminating thoughts, often involving self-derogation or worthlessness. Depression may occur in situations when one’s social status is threatened or an actual fall in rank has taken place. This is often accompanied by a reduction of serotonin availability. Genes conferring risk for depression when coupled with adverse early experiences may even protect against depression when associated with supportive parenting, suggesting genetic plasticity. Aside from ethological considerations, depression may also be linked to a dysfunction of the immune system.",

      "title": "Depression and Suicide",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Most youth occasionally experience the blues, feel sad, or become irritable. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the possibility of a depressive disorder when a depressed or irritable mood is more than temporary, occurs in conjunction with other symptoms, or interferes with daily functioning. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is manifested by a depressed or irritable mood or diminished interest or pleasure that lasts for at least 2 weeks. This is accompanied by changes in cognitive and physical functioning. Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a less severe type of depression that involves chronic symptoms and lasts for at least 1 year. These specific types of depressive disorders are the focus of this article.Depressive disorders can be identified in children of all ages, but they become increasingly prevalent during adolescence. In fact, the peak ages of depressive symptom onset in lifespan studies are 15 to 19 years and 25 to 29 years. The sharpest rise in prevalence occurs among girls during adolescence and early adulthood. Approximately 2% of school-age children and 4% to 6% of adolescents struggle with MDD at any one point in time. Lifetime prevalence rates by late adolescence range between 20% and 25%.Prior to puberty, there is about a 1:1 gender ratio for depressive disorders. After puberty, this shifts to a 2:1 ratio of females to males, which continues throughout adulthood. A combination of hormonal and social changes during puberty may explain the differing rates of depression among males and females.Depression has a complex genetic and environmental basis. Adoption, twin, and family studies all point to the impact of genetic factors, which seem to establish a young person's biologic vulnerability for depression. The onset of a depressive episode, however, often is precipitated by difficult life events or stressful experiences such as a parental divorce, school change, or relationship breakup. Other environmental risk factors include maltreatment (sexual abuse, physical abuse, or neglect). The pathways to depression are complex and variable. Some depressive disorders are more biologic; others are more situational.The symptoms of MDD and DD, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), include changes in physical, cognitive, and emotional domains (Tables 1 and 2).In 1996, the World Health Organization ranked depression among the most disabling of all diseases in the world, leading all other disorders in \"years lived with disabilities.\" The reasons for this are apparent when one considers the course of depressive illness. Approximately 70% of youth who have MDD experience another depressive episode within 5 years, and youth who have depressive disorders have a fourfold risk of an adult depressive disorder. Approximately 50% of children and adolescents who have MDD can be expected to have adult recurrences. Early onset and recurrences also have been described as a cause of treatment-resistant depression in later life, leading to multiple episodes that last longer, become more severe, and become more difficult to treat. These tend to be associated with more hospitalizations, job absenteeism, and impaired work performance.Depressive disorders in youth are associated with impaired functioning in several areas of daily living. These include strained family and peer relationships, school attendance difficulties, and academic performance problems. Affected youth often experience suicidal thoughts and are at increased risk for attempted and completed suicide.Early-onset bipolar disorder (BD) often presents as depressive symptoms, which can make it difficult to distinguish between bipolar and unipolar depression. BD is characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression. The inflated self-esteem, excess energy, and poor judgment that characterize a manic phase often result in dangerous activity and substantial social problems. Rapid cycling and mixed symptom states occur in subtypes of BD. Approximately 20% to 40% of children who have MDD eventually develop BD. Some clues to the risk for developing a manic or hypomanic episode include psychosis, psychomotor retardation, or a family history of BD.Another potential diagnostic dilemma occurs when a child or adolescent is abusing alcohol or drugs. Youth are not always forthcoming about such abuse, which may be associated with declining school performance, withdrawal from usual social activities, sleep disturbance, and negative moods. Careful questioning of the youth and parent/guardian is necessary to identify a substance use disorder in youth presenting with depressive symptoms. It can be equally challenging to identify a depressive disorder in youth initially identified for services because of problems related to alcohol or substance abuse.Most children and adolescents who are depressed also have a history of some other psychiatric or alcohol/drug use disorder. For example, 25% to 75% of depressed youth have one or more anxiety disorders, such as separation anxiety disorder or social phobia. Disruptive behavior disorders, such as attention-deficit disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, are also common, and substance abuse or dependence characterizes a significant minority of youth who are depressed. A gender difference exists in patterns of comorbidity. Girls more commonly have comorbid anxiety conditions; boys are more likely to have comorbid conduct disorders or substance use disorders.Children and adolescents rarely seek professional treatment. Thus, parents, teachers, pediatricians, and others who have regular contact with youth play critical roles in recognizing youth who are depressed. Few youth use the word \"depressed\"; even fewer report to someone that they may be experiencing a clinical depression. Therefore, it is helpful to ask youth about experiences of feeling down, \"bad,\" miserable, bored, or irritated. Signs of clinical depression that often initially are visible to others include withdrawal from activities, decline in school performance, change in sleep patterns, and sadness or irritability.The United States Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended the use of two questions in screening for depression among adults: \"Over the past 2 weeks, have you ever felt down, depressed, or hopeless?\" and \"Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?\" The Task Force concluded that evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of routine screening of children and adolescents, but these two questions may help clinicians detect primary symptoms of depression. More comprehensive screening instruments and diagnostic tools or a referral to a mental health professional should be considered if indicated. The Reynolds Adolescent Depression Inventory (RADS) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) are screening tools used in some school and mental health clinics.Clinical interviews are the cornerstone of a comprehensive assessment and should include, at a minimum, interviews with the youth as well as the parent or guardian. In addition to gathering a complete history of presenting problems (onset, chronicity, severity, prior history of symptoms, and treatment), a full psychiatric interview is conducted to obtain information about possible comorbid conditions. For example, it is critical to ascertain whether psychotic features, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, or substance abuse problems are present. Information also is gathered about the youth's medical, developmental, social, and educational histories as well as the family psychiatric history.Important sources of information may include school academic and attendance records; teacher reports; and appropriate biomedical, psychological, or other test findings. Standardized self-report questionnaires may permit youths to answer questions about current symptoms without directly verbalizing the extent of their emotional distress to an adult. This approach sometimes can facilitate honest reporting of the number and severity of depressive symptoms. If noted in a self-report questionnaire, critical items always should be followed up with direct inquiry by the clinician (eg, if a youth reports suicidal ideation).The initial goals of treatment are to ensure the youth's safety and develop an effective therapeutic alliance with the youth and parents. This alliance will facilitate ongoing communication and continuation of care. Consultation with teachers and other caregivers also is important. A focus on patient and family education and a collaborative approach to treatment planning can enhance the youth's adherence to treatment recommendations.Psychoeducation is a key component of the treatment. Beyond this, perspectives on the first line of treatment vary. The choice of whether to begin with psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic interventions or a combination depends on depression severity and chronicity, prior history of depressive episodes, likelihood of adherence, previous response to treatment, patient and family motivation for treatment, and availability of resources. Because of the psychological, environmental, and social problems associated with depression and its treatment, pharmacotherapy usually is not sufficient as the sole treatment. Attention to parental mental health and family stress as well as to strategies for helping parents manage the youth's irritability, isolation, or other problems should be included in psychotherapeutic interventions. These systemic concerns affect treatment adherence and ultimate outcomes.Psychoeducation addresses the signs and symptoms of depression; the importance of psychotherapy and psychiatric medication; and common misconceptions about the illness, therapy, or medications. It also is helpful to address the impact that depression has on school, social, and family functioning and the ways in which parents and teachers may aid in recovery. Parent and family education may increase adherence and reduce self-blame. Education of parents can help them identify their own mood disorders and potential treatment needs as well. Education also can reduce blame for symptoms such as irritability and anhedonia that may affect others.Controlled studies have documented the short-term effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for depressed youth. Both generally are time-limited therapies that involve collaboration or guided discovery between the therapist and adolescent. CBT focuses on self-understanding of negative mood states and on the identification and modification of negative, distorted thought patterns. It also emphasizes problem-solving skills, communication skills, and the development of more adaptive behavior patterns. IPT strives to improve the youth's interpersonal functioning by improving self-understanding, problem-solving, communication, and coping in the realm of relationships. It focuses on a chosen interpersonal problem such as grief, a difficult role transition, an interpersonal conflict or role dispute, social skill deficits, or issues in step-parent families. Although randomized, controlled clinical trials have not been conducted for psychodynamic therapy with depressed youth, this approach may be useful. Family therapy is an important supplement to any of these approaches if difficulties in family communication and support are identified. Goals of family therapy may include improving family affective communication, increasing adaptive behaviors, and changing both interpersonal and family functioning.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the antidepressants of choice for youth who require pharmacotherapy (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 1998). The efficacy of the SSRI fluoxetine in reducing depressive symptom severity in children and adolescents has been demonstrated in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Paroxetine also has demonstrated efficacy compared with imipramine and placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison. Other antidepressant medications are not well studied. Dosing guidelines recommend starting with 10 mg fluoxetine and increasing to 20 mg. The maximum dose is 40 mg to 80 mg. When treating a child younger than 8 years of age, clinicians may want to start with 4 to 8 mg elixir of fluoxetine. However, the efficacy and safety data have been demonstrated only down to age 8 years. If there are problems with insomnia, appetite loss, or restlessness, paroxetine is a more sedating SSRI, and dosing guidelines are identical to those for fluoxetine. SSRIs should be discontinued if symptoms of mania appear. However, youth may benefit from treatment with an SSRI for an extended period before BD develops.An adequate trial of SSRIs is at least 4 to 6 weeks. If no or only minimal improvement is observed, a dose increase should be considered and medication continued for at least 4 to 6 additional weeks. If no improvement has been observed, alternative strategies should be considered, including a referral to a psychiatrist in cases of treatment-resistant depression. Additionally, if the pediatrician is not comfortable in the prescriber role, a psychiatric consultation or referral to a physician experienced in the use of medication is recommended. Frequent medication adjustments are ill-advised, and tapering of medications that have shorter half-lives (eg, paroxetine) is recommended. Obtaining serum levels rarely is necessary unless concerns arise about toxicity or compliance. Studies among adults suggest that the same doses used to treat MDD are efficacious for DD.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are not considered a first-line treatment for children and adolescents who are depressed, but they may be helpful in treating youth who have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, and narcolepsy as well as for augmentation purposes.In contrast to TCAs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs have a relatively safe adverse effects profile, are easily used (once daily), are suitable for long-term maintenance, and have a low lethality after overdose. Additional information on adverse effects, medication interactions, and the treatment of comorbid conditions is available in reviews of practice recommendations published by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.ECT can be a useful adjunct for individuals whose depression is severe or life-threatening, who have not responded to other treatments, who cannot take antidepressant medications, and who may have psychotic depression. The decision to use ECT must be made carefully and usually requires the recommendation of more than one psychiatrist as well as a substantial discussion with the child's parent or guardian.Unless there are significant adverse effects, medication should be continued for 6 to 12 months if it is believed to help in the remission of depressive symptoms. The pharmacotherapy should be monitored monthly during this continuation phase. Psychotherapy is helpful during this phase to bolster coping skills and to address antecedents, stressors, and interpersonal conflicts that may have contributed to the onset of depression. Medication adherence also may be improved by psychotherapy.Once the patient's symptoms have remitted for 6 to 12 months, the maintenance phase of treatment may last from 1 year to indefinitely. The goals are to facilitate healthy development and to prevent relapse or recurrence. These may be accomplished through monthly or quarterly visits, depending on the severity and chronicity of the present episode, frequency of previous episodes, comorbid disorders, the patient's motivation, and contextual factors (eg, support systems, family stress, and psychopathology).The presence of comorbid conditions often predicts a poorer response to psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatments. These conditions, such as anxiety, disruptive behavior, and substance use disorders, often persist after remission of the depressive symptoms and require targeted treatments. Because of time, cost, or the incompatibility of treatments, addressing all conditions simultaneously may be impossible. Hence, the clinician often must prioritize treatment goals and the sequence of interventions.A depressive disorder may be \"treatment-resistant\" because of an inadequate dosage or duration of medication trial, inadequate duration or \"fit\" with a particular psychotherapy, poor treatment adherence, complicating comorbidity, undetected BD, chronic or severe life events, misdiagnosis, or mistreatment. Psychopharmacologic strategies to address treatment-resistant depression should be applied systematically in conjunction with family education and support and include optimization, switching, augmentation, or combination. Consultation with a psychiatrist always is advised with treatment-resistant cases.If BD is present or is a possibility, a mood-stabilizing agent (eg, lithium carbonate, valproate, or carbamazepine) may be warranted, especially because antidepressants may induce mania in youths at risk for BD. Approximately 30% to 50% of adults experience modest antidepressant effects with mood stabilizers alone. Antidepressants may be useful adjuncts in such treatments. Psychotic depression may require a combination of antidepressants with antipsychotics or ECT. Neuroleptics should be tapered after psychotic symptoms remit due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotic medications may be preferred. However, the long-term effects of these medications have not been studied in youth.Suicide is the third leading cause of death among children and adolescents (National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, 2000). The suicide rate for ages 15 to 24 years is 11.1 per 100,000, which is much higher than the rate for youth between the ages of 5 and 14 years (0.8 per 100,000). The suicide rate for males in the 15- to 19-year age group is markedly higher than that for females (Table 3). Rates differ by racial and ethnic group. African-American youth have lower suicide rates than Caucasian youth, with the lowest adolescent suicide rate being that of African-American females. The highest suicide rate is that of Native American males.Although many youth who report suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide do not become suicide victims, these categories overlap substantially. For instance, having frequent thoughts of suicide is the best predictor of suicide attempts, and most youth who attempt suicide report a history of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, greater severity of reported suicidal thoughts increases the likelihood of a suicide attempt within the next year. Approximately 35% to 45% of adolescents who complete suicide have a positive history of suicide attempt. The prevalences of both self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are higher for adolescent females than for adolescent males (Table 3).Risk factors for completed suicide and suicidal behavior are similar in most respects. There are a few exceptions, however, such as the more specific relationship between availability of firearms and completed suicide. In this section, we review the primary risk factors for completed suicide (Table 4).A history of prior suicidal behavior is the strongest predictor of future suicidal behavior. Nonlethal suicidal gestures or self-inflicted harm, which sometimes are thought to be manipulative or attention-seeking, should not be taken lightly. Youth often can be poor judges of lethality, and what is believed to be a gesture actually may be accompanied by significant suicidal intent. It also may result in substantial physical harm or even suicide because of an error in knowledge or judgment (eg, potential lethality of acetaminophen overdose).Approximately 80% of youth who attempt suicide and 90% of youth suicide victims have histories of identifiable psychiatric or mental disorders. The most common types of psychopathology in these youth are depressive disorders, alcohol or substance abuse, conduct disorder or patterns of aggressive behavior, and anxiety disorders. Increased suicide risk is associated with conditions that often are refractory to treatment or present management problems. These include BD, a chronic depressive disorder comorbid with alcohol or substance abuse, and psychotic presentations.Depressive disorders are linked with increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides (Table 5). In fact, suicidal ideation and behavior are common and often unrelenting problems among youth who have depressive disorders. Eighty-five percent of depressed youth report significant suicidal ideation, and 32% of depressed youth report one or more suicide attempts prior to adulthood. Retrospective studies have found that about 50% of adolescent suicides involve the consumption of alcohol, which increases impulsivity, impaired judgment, and mood changes.Environmental or family stress, especially a history of neglect or physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, are considered significant risk factors for suicidal behavior. Interpersonal conflict and loss (eg, fights, break-ups, deaths) also are risk factors. Additionally, hopelessness, impulsivity, aggressive behavior, and agitation are psychological characteristics associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior.Gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents are at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Recent general population surveys indicate that approximately 42% of these youth experience suicidal ideation, and 28% have made one or more suicide attempts during the past year. Many of the risk factors in these youth are the same as those for heterosexual youth. Problems such as comorbid substance abuse and depression, however, are more common among youth who have a homosexual orientation. In addition, risk factors such as stigmatization and discrimination are specific to those who face negative attitudes within society.The risk for depression, anxiety, and suicide increases when a youth knows someone who commits suicide. In these situations, intervention aimed at promoting grief and mourning and decreasing guilt, trauma, and social isolation as well as providing psychoeducational counseling aimed at decreasing identification with the suicidal behavior are recommended. Media coverage of suicide may spark suicide contagion. Clinicians are encouraged to advise reporters whenever possible to reduce excessive coverage and to advise parents and educators to discourage exposure of youth to such coverage.Firearms are found more commonly in the homes of suicide victims than in the homes of other youth, including those of psychiatrically hospitalized suicidal youth. The importance of restricting suicidal youth's access to firearms is highlighted by documented associations between more restrictive gun control laws and decreases in suicide rates. Similarly, potentially lethal drugs (such as prescription or over-the-counter sedative drugs) either should be removed from the homes of potentially suicidal youth or monitored closely by parents and guardians.Evidence suggests that if asked directly, adolescents will reveal suicidal preoccupations and previous suicidal behavior. Direct questions should address whether children or adolescents wish they were not alive, if they ever have thought about or tried to hurt themselves intentionally, if they ever have thought about or tried to kill themselves, and if they have or had such a plan in mind. It is important to understand that asking an adolescent about suicidal thoughts or behaviors will not \"put such ideas into his or her head\" or increase the risk for suicidal behavior. Follow-up inquiry regarding the intensity, chronicity, specificity, and recency of such thoughts is advised. Standardized self-report questionnaires, such as the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, may permit the youth to answer without direct verbalization, which can facilitate honesty. If endorsed, critical items related to intent or planning and items suggesting significant suicidality (in terms of chronicity, severity, or frequency) always should be followed up with direct inquiry. Other sources of information include reports from parents, teachers, or others who may have heard suicidal statements or witnessed behaviors such as giving away prized possessions. As with the assessment of depressive disorders, a comprehensive evaluation that incorporates input from the youth and parent or guardian is essential.A psychiatric inpatient or partial hospitalization program may be necessary for patients found to be at elevated suicide risk. Hospital stays generally are brief and emphasize safety, stabilization, evaluation, and aftercare recommendations. Suicide attempts (or plans) that have significant lethality and that include efforts taken to avoid detection indicate serious intent as well as knowledge and planning and should be taken extremely seriously. Furthermore, attention to safety requires consideration of the child's home environment. Parents and caregivers should be advised to remove lethal agents, especially firearms and toxic medications, from the home. Self-injurious behaviors by young children should not be disregarded as accidental. For example, when a 6-year-old child ingests poisonous materials, it may not be accidental. Such behavior should be assessed carefully for associated mood or other disturbance.Verbal or written \"no suicide\" contracts are used in many settings. The patient is asked to agree not to attempt suicide. Furthermore, the patient is asked to agree to contact the clinician, parent, or other responsible adult if he or she feels a suicidal urge or experiences suicidal intent. Perspectives on these contracts have evolved over the past decade, with an increasing emphasis on using the contract as an assessment tool. The contract process may reveal current suicidal intent. It also provides information about the patient's ability to identify, and willingness to turn to, helpful adults. It is useful to review what positive coping steps the youth and parent would take in the event of a suicidal crisis. This offers an opportunity for problem-solving and can counter the tendency of some youth and families to minimize or deny the risk of suicidal behavior. It should be noted, however, that research does not support the conclusion that such contracts prevent suicide; they are not substitutes for comprehensive case management.When caring for a potentially suicidal youth, suicide risk factors, including suicidal thoughts, urges, and behaviors, are monitored at each session. Rules of thumb when working with suicidal youth include: 1) confirming next appointment times at each session, 2) following up on \"no-shows,\" and 3) providing information to the youth and parent or guardian about easily accessible 24-hour emergency services. Comprehensive case management includes psychoeducation and regular patient monitoring with guidelines for responding to crises/changes in functioning.The population of suicidal youth is heterogeneous in terms of primary psychiatric disorder(s), comorbid conditions, personality traits, the presence of complicating psychosocial issues, developmental level, and demographic characteristics. Therefore, the treatment should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of psychopathology and, more generally, suicide risk and protective factors.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of peripartum depression are the same as those of major depressive disorder, and include depressed mood, insomnia, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, guilt, worthlessness, fatigue, impaired concentration, change in appetite, and change in motor activity. Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

It has been shown to predict the course of neurotic depression [6], major depressive disorder [9], and bipolar disorder [1 1], and treatment dropout among patients with anorexia nervosa [12].

      "abstract": "Stress is the body's response to any changes that might place it under mental, emotional, or physical strain and could either demand attention or prompt action. A stress reaction can be brought on by both internal and external factors. The conditions, demands, issues, and expectations you deal with every day are all regarded as external influences, as are your physical surroundings, your job, your contacts with others, your family, and all other related factors. The ability of your body to respond to and handle external stimuli depends on internal factors. Your ability to handle stress is influenced internally by your food habits, level of general health and fitness, mental health, and the amount of sleep and rest you get. Such demanding conditions could affect how certain stress hormone levels are regulated. Biomarkers such as mGlu2/3, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), serum alpha-amylase, amygdala reactivity, neuropeptide Y (NPY), heat shock proteins, cortisol, and catecholamines are used to assess the hormone imbalance. Disease prevention, early detection, and therapy are all possible uses for biomarkers. In this review, we looked at a wide range of stress-related biomarkers that might cause different psychiatric illnesses and how those conditions can, over time, alter a person's lifestyle.",

Even the very word anxiety varies from one language to another [1]. In the scientific literature, anxiety is understood to refer to an emotional state and a personality trait (in Russian, the term trevozhnost ' is used for this), a set of autonomic and endocrine responses, and the affective component of a stress reaction. Normal anxiety is a natural, adaptive response to a potentially threatening situation; but psychiatrists basically are confronted with pathological anxiety. This concept is also inadequately defined: an anxiety that is too intense or prolonged to fit the event causing it is usually called pathological. There is no doubt that anxiety occurring spontaneously, without an actual stress situation, is pathological. Hormonal disorders, e.g., pheochromocytoma or hyperthyroidism, are relatively rare causes of such anxiety. However, in most cases",

      "title": "Guidelines for treating depressive illness with antidepressants: A statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common illness which affects some 3% of the population per year. At least 25% of those with marked depression do not consult their general practitioner and in half of those who do the illness is not detected. Depression is easy to recognize when four or five of the core symptoms have been present for 2 weeks which often coincides with some occupational and social impairment. The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame and suicidal thoughts. A diagnosis of depression is made when five of these core symptoms, one of which should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, have been present for 2 weeks. Four core symptoms are probably sufficient. Response to antidepressants is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or very mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to antidepressants is more uncertain. Antidepressants are effective, they are not addictive and do not lose efficacy with prolonged use. The newer antidepressants have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, they are better tolerated and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. They are less cardiotoxic and are safer in overdose. Antidepressants should be used at full therapeutic doses. Treatment failure is often due to too low a dose being used in general practice. It may be difficult to reach the right dose with the older tricyclics because of side effects. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 months after the patient is apparently well. Stopping the treatment before this is ill-advised as the partially treated depression frequently returns. Most depression is recurrent. Long-term antidepressant treatment is effective in reducing the risk of new episodes of depression and should be continued to keep the patient well.",

The purpose of this study was to describe the symptom burden in the first 3 weeks postconcussion and estimate the strength of relationship between symptomatology and days postconcussion. Headache was the most commonly endorsed symptom during weeks 1 (71.1%), 2 (37.6%), and 3 (32.6%). Severity scores were negatively correlated with days postconcussion, p < .01. While headache is commonly reported following a concussion, and decreases with time, it was still endorsed 3 weeks postinjury.

      "abstract": "Physical illness is a frequent event in everyone's life and in most cases has no particular effect on the psychological structure of the individual. However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "title": "Neurobiology of emotional trauma",
      "abstract": "An emotional trauma may induce a cascade of neurobiological events that have long-lasting consequences even altered gene expression. Early abuse and neglect can deregulate the child's developing neurobiological system by reducing its resistance to stressful events, leading to later problems of emotional regulation. Children who have been subjected to physical or emotional abuse tend to pay more attention to signs that contain anger and are hypersensitive to threat. Scar hypothesis and the theories of behavioural sensitization or electrophysiological kindling suggest that emotional traumas may leave traces that persist even after remission of depression, and render individuals vulnerable to the onset of new episodes, even under the influence of only moderate psychosocial stress. Unfavorable early social experiences, such as emotional abuse or institutionalization can affect the structure and function of the prefrontal cortex. Exposure to repeated emotional stressors, even in the absence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses, has been shown to produce increased synapse formation and dendritic growth in basolateral amygdala, dendritic retraction in the hippocampus, and anxiety-like behavior against specific triggers, such as phobia of open spaces. During the narration of an emotionally traumatic event, there is activation of the limbic system, the right amygdale, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, there is an activation of the anterior insula, which records the physical impact of negative emotions, and the anterior and medial temporal cortex, which are involved in negative emotions. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD patients have found hypoactivity in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate and thalamic areas, indicating the effects of PTSD on executive function, attention and cognitive, memorial, and affective and somatosensory integration. One of the most replicated findings in studies involving PTSD patients is the decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found a negative correlation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation. A recent meta-analysis revealed structural brain abnormalities associated with PTSD and emotional trauma and suggested that global brain volume reductions can distinguish PTSD from major depression. Neuroimaging studies of successful eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment have consistently shown that patients exhibited increased frontal lobe activation. Moving beyond diagnostic boundaries, focusing on the causal interplay between specific traumatic processes and using standardized measures, are useful directions for future research in memory, emotion and emotional trauma.",

      "title": "A narrative review of risk factors and predictors for poor outcome and prolonged recovery after a mild traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are often caused by a blow to the head or a sudden jolt resulting in a wide range of physical, cognitive, and emotional temporary symptoms. Mild TBI diagnosis can be challenging and most commonly followed by post-concussion syndrome (PCS). When the symptoms are present for more than 3 months, prolonged post-concussive syndrome (PPCS) can be suspected. This review aims to identify and summarize the current status of the knowledge regarding the risk factors and predictors of the recovery from PCS and PPCS. A comprehensive search of the main scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) was performed using keywords, such as: 'prolonged post-concussion syndrome', combined with 'risk factors', 'predictors', and 'outcomes'. Multiple studies reported more than one risk factor for PPCS development following mTBIs that were generally the results of sports-related concussions and car accidents. The most prevalent risk factor associated with PPCS was the female sex. Social factors/personality traits, anxiety, mental health disorders, or other health conditions from their past medical history, the occurrence of headache/migraines during TBI recovery, somatization, physical activity, and litigation were also reported to contribute to PPCS risk. An exhaustive approach is required to mitigate the risk of PPCS and to ensure optimal recovery after concussive events. However, larger prospective cohort studies evaluating patients that were examined and treated with standardized protocols could be needed to further validate these associations and mandate the highest risk factors for delayed recovery.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt. Ebenso werden die Herausforderungen für die medizinische Versorgung skizziert und Hinweise für den Umgang im klinischen Alltag gegeben.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum is not a specific entity. There is neither a very specific psychopathology nor evidence for a specific aetiology. The prevalence of severe is not significantly enhanced in the year as compared to women of the same age group without delivery who have quite a high prevalence of anyway. Incidence of milder might slightly be enhanced in the first weeks. Giving birth and adapting to the new mother role seem to be stressors contributing to the outbreak of in vulnerable, predisposed women or to enhance pre-existing depression. Biological, especially hormonal, as well as psychosocial factors can be relevant stressors in this situation. Although this is not a specific entity, the diagnostic term or specifier postpartum depression might still be justified, as in early motherhood shows many important specifities. Diagnosis is especially difficult, as women, due to shame, stigma and many fears, do not seek help and doctors, due to misinterpretation of symptoms, often do not recognise the severity of the situation. Untreated, these disorders can have especially severe consequences, not only for the mother, but also for the child and the whole family. These disorders therefore need our special attention and special treatment. This means modifications of our pharmacological, non-pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment methods. Therapy - although in principle the same as that of other depressive disorders - has to put a special emphasis on the needs of the period. Education about the fact that this is a disease and not due to failure as a mother is of utmost importance to relieve the patients from feelings of guilt. Counselling and practical advice for the mother and her family is often needed as well as the help of a midwife, a family nurse, a social worker and/or other health care professionals. A good mother-infant bonding should be a main concern from the start. This means that the mother should not be separated from her infant for longer periods of time. However, she needs a lot of help in order to allow for relaxed contacts with the infant. Pharmacological treatment is often complicated by the patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation as regards the potential side effects and/or long-term consequences for the infant. On the other hand, the risks of ongoing severe are generally regarded as higher than the potential risks of medication. Thus, if a mother insists on breast-feeding, she has to be educated about side effects and the baby has to be carefully monitored. Several studies have in the meantime also shown positive effects of oestrogen substitution and non-pharmacological treatments such as bright-light therapy. Psychotherapy should be initiated as soon as possible and be very supportive in the beginning. Specific manualised forms of psychotherapy for women with have also shown very promising results. In the future, more emphasis should be laid on prophylaxis, specific education and the broad implementation of low-threshold services. Under all circumstances, special attention must be given to the mother-child-relationship, on the one hand to reduce feelings of guilt in the mother and thereby to enhance the process of healing, on the other hand to prevent traumatisation of the infant and to avoid deleterious long-term consequences.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a multifaceted disorder characterized by multiple motor and at least one vocal tics that start in childhood, persist for at least 1 year, and cannot be attributed to another medical condition or exposure to medications/drugs. Clinical diagnostic criteria are available, and identification of tics is typically straightforward based on characteristic appearance and features. Diagnostic uncertainty can rarely arise in cases of mild tics, atypical features, certain psychiatric comorbidities, and other non-tic movement disorders. Comorbid psychopathology, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive behaviors/obsessive-compulsive disorder, affects the majority of patients and is correlated with disease severity and the presence of additional psychiatric behaviors. The severity of tics often improves after adolescence, whereas psychiatric symptoms typically persist. The subset of patients in whom tics persist into adulthood experience higher rates of anxiety, and lower self-esteem, socioeconomic status, and quality of life; the relative contribution of motor tics and psychopathology is not fully understood. This article summarizes the clinical features of Tourette syndrome, including major diagnostic criteria, unique features of tics, and key aspects that differentiate tics from common mimics and chameleons. Comorbid psychiatric conditions and their impact on phenotype and quality of life are described. Finally, current understanding of the natural history is summarized, including limited research in adults with Tourette syndrome.",

A review of studies on stress and/or coping strategies in SLE since 1990 is presented. Many studies have investigated the place of major and minor stress and coping strategies in SLE morbidity (disease activity, organ damage, and physical and mental components of quality of life). Stress as a causal factor is not proved, but it seems to act as an exacerbating factor in disease activity and to have an impact on the quality of life. Coping strategies are more consistently associated with quality of life than with disease activity. Organ damage appears to be less associated with psychosocial factors than disease activity or quality of life. Despite the limitations of these studies, therapeutic interventions should be proposed to reduce psychological distress, to improve the quality of life and possibly to moderate the evolution of the disease.",

It ends with the outbreak of an episode meeting the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. This phase is considered a key period in the prognosis of the disease because it provides access to early diagnosis. Identify the symptoms of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia and point out the duration of their development in a sample of Tunisian patients. Detect the specifities of prodromal phase in Tunisia. 15 schizophrenia patients with illness duration of less than 3 years were included. All patients were in clinical remission from at least 3 months (PANNS and BPRS). Exclusion criteria were any history of other psychiatric or neurological disorders and alcohol or drug abuse. Prodromal symptoms were assessed with the scale of prodromal symptoms (SOPS) developed by Mc Glashan. It is a heteroquestionnaire for patients and their parents. The mean duration of prodromal phase was about 2 years with extremes ranging from 6 months to 4 years. The most severe prodromal symptoms were suspiciousness/ persecutory ideas, social isolation, dysphoric mood and impaired tolerance to normal stress The most frequent prodromal symptoms were impaired tolerance to normal stress, dysphoric mood, sleep disturbance, social isolation and suspiciousness/ persecutory ideas. We have not found any difference between male and female. The prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia found in the Tunisian socio cultural context are similar to those found in other countries.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Factors Associated with Substance-Related Disorders; Three Stratified Dimensions",
      "abstract": "There are three major dimensional aspects with regard to associations between substance-related disorders (SRD) and psychosocial factors. They are religious/spiritual, job-related, and symptomatic (clinical) factors, each of which strongly affects or modifies the quality of life among SRD patients. Those factors construct a stratum in which each factor correlates with the other. The most fundamental factors are religious/spiritual, and based on their sense of value and morality, legal regulations on relevant substances are enforced. Such legal regulations directly stipulate job environments, in other words, social restriction as the second dimension of psychosocial factors among SRD patients. That is, illicit drug use results in dismissals and difficulty in obtaining new jobs. Since unemployment status is strongly associated with SRD, a vicious cycle is formed between SRD and unemployment. Catastrophic events such as suicide often occur as a result of such negative spiral. Due to these social factors related to substances, somatic symptoms, the final signs directly connected to medical treatments and revealed by SRD patients, might be seriously biased. Such somatic symptoms can be regarded as the third dimension of psychosocial factors surrounding SRD. Negative emotions such as stigmas, prejudices, or feelings of shame concerning one’s mental disorder (including SRD) might prevent patients from showing apparent mental symptoms associated with SRD. Because negative emotions possibly arise on the basis of cultural backgrounds, it is important to take into account the effects of such factors when evaluating and studying the associations between somatic symptoms and SRD. The most important issue for the rectification of health inequality among SRD patients is to sweep away discriminations and prejudices against SRD, but this is difficult since such negative emotions are likely to take root in a religious/spiritual context.",

Evolutionary psychology indicates that distress arising in these contexts stems from psychological mechanisms that are responding appropriately to stressful circumstances. A diagnosis of mental disorder, in contrast, indicates that these mechanisms are not functioning as they are designed to function. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, however, has come to treat both the natural results of the stress process and individual pathology as mental disorders. A number of social groups benefit from and promote the conflation of normal emotions with dysfunctions. The result has been to overestimate the number of people who are considered to be disordered, to focus social policy on the supposedly unmet need for treatment, and to enlarge the social space of pathology in the general culture.",

It talks about clinical features of major depressive disorder (MDD), its subtypes, stress, learned helplessness and the causes and treatments for depression. Current management of MDD involves the use of antidepressant drugs together with psychological treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy.

      "title": "Los factores psicosociales como predictores pronósticos de difícil retorno laboral tras incapacidad",
      "abstract": "espanolSe esta incapacitado laboralmente, por estar enfermo y presentar limitaciones funcionales que afectan a la capacidad laboral y que impiden trabajar. Los factores psicosociales son determinantes en la salud de la poblacion y por tanto determinantes en la enfermedad y el enfermar de la poblacion trabajadora. Los factores psicosociales son factores precipitantes en el inicio de la incapacidad, son factores de mantenimiento de la incapacidad ligados a la cronificacion de los procesos de incapacidad, condicionan la mala respuesta y la adherencia terapeutica, suponen barreras al retorno laboral, y pueden ser causa de presentismo laboral (estar presente en el trabajo, en malas condiciones por temor a perder el empleo). Los factores psicosociales son predictores del retorno al trabajo. Puesto que se trata de factores previos a la declaracion de la incapacidad conviene conocerlos para prevenir la aparicion de la incapacidad y su mantenimiento que determina un no retorno laboral o su postergacion, tanto en la incapacidad temporal como permanente. Los factores psicosociales no causan la incapacidad pero pueden precipitarla, mantenerla o modificarla, terminando por condicionar la capacidad/incapacidad laboral. En un estudio de seguimiento de procesos de baja que alcanzaron los 365 dias, los factores psicosociales estaban presentes en un 23% de forma significativa. Material y metodo: se revisaron hasta mayo de 2017 las siguientes bases de datos bibliograficas: SciELO, PUBMED, asi como estudio de factores psicosociales en presentes en procesos de baja que llegaron a 365 dias. Conclusiones: Los factores psicosociales estan en el inicio de la baja como detonante impeditivo laboral de situaciones basales previas. Estan en la cronificacion del proceso una vez que la incapacidad se ha producido, estan en la percepcion del paciente de persistencia sintomatologica y de escasa respuesta al tratamiento, conllevan una percepcion de mala evolucion de su proceso de incapacidad, potencian lo disfuncional discapacitante y dificultan el retorno laboral. Si permanecen no resueltos y se produce el retorno al trabajo seran causan de bajo rendimiento laboral, pudiendo ser determinante de “ineptitud sobrevenida” y despido. Por todo ello, es capital la identificacion temprana y la prevencion de estos factores psicosociales para aminorar el absentismo por incapacidad. Las siguientes medidas reduciran el impacto de los factores psicologicos en la incapacidad temporal: actuar sobre las respuestas emocionales inadecuadas mediante atencion psicologica. Atencion temprana de los procesos osteomusculares y psiquicos. Evitar listas de espera para pruebas diagnosticas y para tratamientos. Consideracion preventiva de las decisiones de alta medica. Incorporacion parcial al trabajo (altas parciales) tras incapacidad. Facilitar la adaptacion laboral ante la “actitud sobrevenida” del trabajador reincorporado. Evitar controversias entre alta medica y no apto, con concordancia decisoria. Horarios flexibles o reduccion horaria que favorezcan la conciliacion familiar. Prestaciones sociales para la atencion a familiares con dependencia o gravemente enfermos. Mayor deteccion y proteccion de los factores psicosociales en el trabajo. Mejoras en la organizacion, condiciones y clima laboral, que fomenten la satisfaccion laboral. EnglishOne may be incapacitated for work for being ill and presenting functional limitations that affect the work capacity preventing him/her from work. Psychosocial factors are decisive in the health of the population and therefore decisive in both the disease itself and in the fact of working population getting sick. These psychosocial factors are precipitating factors at the onset of disability.They are factors that keep the incapacity active which linked to the chronification of the incapacity processes they condition the poor response and the therapeutic adherence. They imply barriers to return to work, and may cause presenteeism (being present at work in poor conditions for fear of losing employment). Psychosocial factors are predictors of returning to work. Since they are initial factors to the declaration of the incapacity it is necessary to know them well to prevent the appearance and maintenance that determine a non-return labor or its postponement, either in the temporary or permanent incapacity. Psychosocial factors do not cause disability but can precipitate it, maintain it or modify it, ending up by conditioning the capacity / incapacity for work. Psychosocial factors were present in a significant 23% in a follow-up study of medical leave processes that reached up to 365 days. Material and method: the following bibliographic databases were searched up to May 2017: SciELO, PUBMED, as well as the psychosocial factors study appeared in low processes up to 365 days. Conclusions: The psychosocial factors are at the beginning of the sick leave as a preventive labor trigger of previous baseline situations. They are in the chronification process once the disability has occurred; they are in the patient’s perception of symptom persistence and poor response to treatment; they imply a perception of poor evolution of their incapacitation process, enhance the dysfunctional disabling and hinder the return to work. Unresolved and still returning to work will be cause of low work performance, being able to be determinant of “ineptitude overdue” and dismissed. For theses reasons it is important to early identify and prevent these psychosocial factors in order to reduce absenteeism due to disability. The following measures will reduce the impact of psychological factors on temporary disability: acting on inadequate emotional responses through psychological care; taking an early attention to musculoskeletal and psychic processes; avoiding the waiting lists for the diagnostic tests and treatments; having a preventive consideration of return-to-work decisions; taking a partial incorporation to work (high partial fit notecertified sickness episodes) after incapacity; facilitating the work adaptation to the “overcoming attitude” of the returned worker; avoiding disputes reaching decisive agreements between medically discharged and unfit; providing flexible hours or reduced hours that favor family reconciliation; receiving social care benefits for the dependents or acutely ill family members’ attention; having a greater detection and protection of psychosocial factors at work and improving the organization, conditions and working climate promoting the satisfaction labor.",

      "title": "Avaliação dos fatores psicossociais, estratégias de \"coping\" e síndrome de \"Burnout\" na residência médica",
      "abstract": "Introduction:The medical residency has been receiving attention in specialized literature as a period during which newly-graduated physicians are subjected to excessive workload (with a minimum weekly journey of 60 hours); low confidence both in their qualifications and practical training; and adverse interpersonal relations and rigid hierarchy involving their senior colleagues, professors and other professionals in their workplace.This situation exposes the junior physicians to psychosocial factors which, according to subjective perception and individual ways of coping, could lead to stress and psychic suffering, with negative repercussions upon the heath of those doctors and, consequently, of patients receiving care.In this period, residents face adverse situations more intensely than ever before during their training, which often hamper the seeking of personal satisfaction and professional fulfillment.On the other hand, it is known that coping mechanisms-i.e,strategies employed to keep mental health when confronted with different stressorscan evolve and adapt according to personal or collective experiences.When coping is not effective, impaired mental health may manifest as mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety; and as symptoms of chronic work-related stress disorders, the so-called Burnout Syndrome.Objetives: The present study aims at identifying the psychosocial factors in the medical residency; the ways of coping employed by residents; and, as a measure of a negative outcome, the Burnout syndrome among medical residents of a public medical college. Subjects and Method: Cross-section research with regularly enrolled medical residents in a university hospital in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, conducted between August and December, 2016.Residents were invited to fill out a series of selfresponse questionnaires, including a biosocial survey and validated instruments to identify ways of coping (Ways of Coping Questionnaire by Folkman and Lazarus) and Burnout syndrome (Maslach Burnout Inventory).Results: 33 (18.7%) of the medical residents completed the survey.It revealed excessive working hours as the psychosocial factor most frequently pointed out as stressogenic, being \"Solving Problems\" and \"Escape-avoidance\" the most used ways of coping.The registered prevalence of Burnout was 9.4% amongst the surveyed residents. Conclusion:Because of the central role of the medical training and career in the develpoment of physicians' identity, Medical Residents are particularly vulnerable to mental suffering derived from adverse conditions in the workplace.This study hopes to shed light on the subject in Brazil.More research is needed in Brazilian institutions to accurately define psychosocial factors impacting its medical residents' health and well-being, as well to draw strategies to reduce emotional suffering in these health professionals.",

They may be diagnosed in either the presence or absence of individual mental disorders. In some cases, relational problems may interact with genetic vulnerabilities in contributing to the development of psychopathology. Four major constructs have been investigated that describe nodal areas of relational difficulty in the family and marital environment: structure, communication, expression of affect, and problem solving. Relational problems are best observed and treated directly in a family format in which the conflicted family members are present with the therapist. Genetics, neuroimaging, and family studies are important vehicles for deciphering how interpersonal relationships affect the etiology of both physical and mental disorders.",

Using data from a longitudinal community pregnancy cohort (All Our Families; AOF), the present study examined the associations between early developmental risk factors, including early childhood pain experiences and mental health symptoms, and the onset of pediatric chronic pain at ages 8 and 11 years.",

      "title": "Psychiatric causes of behavioural change in adults less than 65 years old",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mr. Leow, aged 64 years, presents to the polyclinic with a memo from his nursing home stating 3 months of behavioural change. He was observed to have been cleaning his environment excessively, inexplicably even climbing onto the roof in the middle of the night to clean. His restlessness and the ruckus made by him disturb the other residents of the nursing home, and his nurses are finding it difficult to supervise him.WHAT IS ALTERED BEHAVIOUR? Altered mental state is a broad presenting complaint used to describe abnormal consciousness, cognition or behaviour.[1] In the older population, delirium, specifically a fluctuation in orientation and attention in an ill elderly person, is a main consideration. In the slightly younger adult population of less than 65 years of age, altered mentation can vary greatly in presentation, severity and underlying cause. Acute behavioural change is a subset of altered mental state and does not involve diminished consciousness or awareness.[1] There is no fixed definition. Instead, behavioural changes are usually reported deviations from the patient's baseline and behaviour generally accepted as appropriate according to cultural norms. These can be in the form of psychomotor agitation, changes in personality, bizarre actions, heightened or decreased energy and others.[2] Most represent either an organic or psychiatric condition, but all warrant expedient and thorough medical evaluation. There are wide-ranging organic and psychiatric aetiologies causing behavioural changes in adults (Appendix). For the purpose of this article, we will focus on common psychiatric conditions causing altered behaviour. HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? Patients with severe and acute changes in behaviour and mental states present more commonly to the emergency department or psychiatric services than primary care clinics.[2] Primary care physicians may encounter patients with subacute presentations or behaviour that is less disruptive to daily life. There is no data documenting the prevalence of behavioural changes presenting to the primary care clinic. There is, however, high prevalence but underrecognition of mental disorders presenting to primary care,[345] resulting in delayed diagnoses and a significant duration of possible untreated psychiatric disorder.[6] This is juxtaposed to the fact that primary care clinics remain the preferred setting patients with mental disorders first seek help from,[357] making it all the more necessary for family physicians to differentiate psychiatric conditions from organic causes. WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? History and examination As much as possible, corroborative history should be obtained.[8] Physicians often pick up valuable clues from patients' or, in this case, caregivers' observed accounts of the presenting complaint. In an otherwise broad and ill-defined presentation, contextual clues from the caregiver's accounts help to narrow differentials. A reliable third party's observations will also facilitate objective comparison between the patient's baseline and the current pathological behaviour.[9] Helpful questions include the following: What was the behavioural change observed? Was the onset sudden or gradual? Are there intermittent or fluctuating symptoms? Was there a precipitating event? What perpetuates the behaviour and what alleviates it? What has the progress been since? What was the patient's baseline mental state, behaviour, personality, cognition and function like? Severity can be assessed by the degree of disruption to the individual's function, in terms of activities of daily living, occupation and interpersonal relationships. Risk of self-harm and/or harm to others needs to be assessed to decide the need for emergent hospital or psychiatric facility admission. See Box 1 for the suggested criteria for referral to the emergency department.Box 1: Criteria for referral to emergency department.For all patients, a set of vital signs should be recorded and neurological and mental state examinations performed. Where there is suspicion, examination of appropriate systems based on pertinent history should be carried out, for instance, examination for bruising, cataracts, abdominal striae and supraclavicular fat pads for Cushing's syndrome in patients with history of exogenous steroid ingestion (see Appendix for the list of organic causes). Although not diagnostic by individual components and many organic conditions may result in similar mental status presentations, the mental state examination (MSE) offers invaluable clues to diagnosis[210] and completes the evaluation. See Figure 1 for the suggested algorithm for evaluation in a clinic. Primary care physicians ought to be familiar with the components of the MSE. For instance, a blunted affect, evidence of self-neglect, hallucinations or paranoia support diagnosis of psychosis, whether primary or secondary to organic causes.[11] Inattention may be present in substance abuse, mood disorders or schizophrenia. Observations of speech and behaviour are helpful – disorganised speech or paucity of speech occurs in psychotic conditions or depression, word-finding difficulty in dementia and pressured speech in mania or thyrotoxicosis.[10]Figure 1: Suggested algorithm for evaluation in clinic. ANA=anti-nuclear antibody, ED=emergency department, ESR=erythrocyte sedimentation rate, FBC=full blood count, HIV=human immunodeficiency virus, LFT=liver function test, TFT=thyroid function test, UFEME=urine full examination and microscopic examinationApproach Due to time constraints in the clinic setting, a concise and clear approach to evaluating the patient with behavioural changes is necessary. Clinicians may follow the algorithm below to decide on disposition. Patients who are clinically stable with manageable behaviour and who do not urgently require inpatient investigations can continue to be evaluated in the clinic. Basic blood tests ought to be performed before attempting to attribute the behavioural disturbance to psychiatric origins.[5912] Where there is clinical suspicion, tests for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, or antinuclear antibody and erythrocyte sedimentation rate for systemic lupus erythematosus can be performed.[8] WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? One should bear in mind that oftentimes, longitudinal follow-up and observation of the patient's progress over time is necessary for the diagnosis to be reached. Revisitation of the patient's presentation and further corroborative history may be needed to revise diagnoses as patient's symptomology evolves. When diagnoses are not clear-cut or when the initial treatment is ineffective, specialist consult should be sought. Psychiatric differentials See Table 1 for various psychiatric differentials and their featuresTable 1: Psychiatric differential diagnoses to changes in behaviour in adults less than 65 years old.Late-onset schizophrenia Although generally diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood, there is a significant proportion of patients, estimated to be 23.5% from one study,[3] whose symptoms of psychosis only present later in life, after 40 years of age. Patients with late-onset (defined as onset after 40 years of age) or very late-onset (defined as onset after 65 years of age) schizophrenia differ from their younger counterparts in that they have more positive than negative symptoms. Among positive symptoms, the prevalence of complex visual, tactile and olfactory hallucinations, paranoid, persecutory and partition delusions is higher than that of thought disorders and disorganisation.[11] These patients also tend to be female and have better premorbid function and prognosis.[1112] In primary care, there are often a myriad of non-specific prodromal symptoms that result in frequent primary care attendances many years before the diagnosis of psychosis is made, suggesting that there is room for earlier identification of at-risk individuals. These range from a variety of somatic complaints, mood-related symptoms and changes in behaviour, such as impaired personal grooming, social withdrawal and odd behaviour, to the more obvious changes in perception.[6] Psychotic symptoms are commonly associated with depression, anxiety, substance abuse[8] and other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, autoimmune conditions and chronic lung disease.[6] Very late-onset psychosis is further associated with sensory deficits such as vision or conductive hearing loss.[311] These comorbidities ought to be explored and treated where possible. Undiagnosed bipolar disorder Bipolar disorders are frequently missed or misdiagnosed as depression in primary care.[413] Depressive episodes are frequently the first presentation of bipolar disorder, with episodes of extroversion and increased energy unrecognised as manifestations of mania or hypomania. Certain behavioural changes can be subtle, such as frequent changes in jobs, legal trouble in the past or recurrent depression not responding to antidepressants.[13] With increasing prevalence of depression being managed in primary care[4] and the use of antidepressants as monotherapy being contraindicated in mania, every patient suspected to have depression should be screened for bipolar disorder. Frontotemporal dementia Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is another condition underrecognised in primary care, often resulting in significant delays in diagnosis. There are three variants of FTD: behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), semantic dementia and progressive non-affluent aphasia. Although distinct, all three conditions overlap in inappropriate behaviour, emotional blunting, loss of insight and relatively preserved memory and visuospatial ability. Behavioural changes in bvFTD occur insidiously over months with decline in social conduct, apathy, disinhibition and poor impulse control manifesting as unwanted sexual advances, hoarding, roaming and hyperorality.[14] As with other major neurocognitive disorders, there must be a deterioration in baseline function, whether interpersonal, occupational or daily function, for FTD to be diagnosed. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease, anti-cholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated in the treatment of bvFTD due to preserved cholinergic function[1415] and may, in fact, worsen the behaviour. N-methyl-d-aspartic acid antagonists show limited efficacy. Instead, treatment is usually targeted at relief of symptoms and management of behaviour. Take-Home Messages Patients with psychiatric conditions frequently present to primary care, either for prodromal symptoms long before their symptoms manifest or when their behavioural change becomes noticeable by caregivers. A high index of suspicion and thorough evaluation are needed to avoid missing the diagnosis. Corroborative history from a caregiver or family member is crucial in establishing the nature of the complaint, as it provides a reliable picture of the patient's baseline behaviour. Organic conditions, including drug causes, ought to be evaluated first in changes in behaviour before psychiatric diagnoses can be made. These may require extensive organic work-up, for which a referral to the emergency department for admission is indicated. Late-onset schizophrenia is an important diagnosis to consider, especially if there are complex hallucinations, delusions preceded by prodromal symptoms. Concomitant mood disorders, substance abuse, sensory loss and chronic medical conditions ought to be evaluated and treated in patients with possible psychosis. All patients presenting with depression ought to be also evaluated for bipolar disorder to prevent misdiagnosis and wrong treatment. FTD should be considered when there is a decline in cognitive function with apathy, poor impulse control or deterioration in interpersonal relationship. Closing Vignette Due to disruptive behaviour, Mr. Leow was eventually admitted to an acute hospital for work-up. He underwent toxicology studies, further blood tests, a lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. All tests were negative, except for uniform atrophy of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Further cognitive testing showed frontal lobe dysfunction and moderate cognitive impairment. With an impairment in judgement, impulsivity, lack of insight and an absence of hypomania features, Mr. Leow was eventually diagnosed with FTD. He was discharged after all investigations were complete, initiated on a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor and given outpatient specialist follow-up on his behaviour.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "Conversion disorder following termination of pregnancy.",
      "abstract": "A variety of psychologic disorders may present as physical complaints without organic basis. As characterized by Sydenham over 300 years ago, such disorders \"mimic all the physical disease to which man is heir.\" The case here presents the evolution of a conversion disorder (urinary retention) in response to a decision to terminate pregnancy. The predominant disturbance in a conversion disorder is an involuntary loss or alteration in somatic function that is temporally related with an environmental stressor. Conversion, as a defense mechanism, provides primary gain by keeping the conflict from the patient's awareness and secondary gains by generating environmental support and avoidance of undesired activities. Awareness of a patient's current life events, past responses to stress, and support systems is essential in order to recognize and manage this array of physical complaints of functional origin.The case report discussed here presents the evolution of a conversion disorder (urinary retention) in response to a decision to terminate a pregnancy. According to the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM 3), the following are the current criteria for a diagnosis of conversion (psychogenic pain): the predominant disturbance is a loss of or alteration in physical functioning suggesting a physical disorder; psychological factors are judged to be etiologically involved as evidenced by 1 of the following--a temporal relationship exists between an environmental stimulus that apparently related to a psychological conflict or need and the initiation or exacerbation of the symptom, the symptom enables the individual to get support from the environment that otherwise might not be forthcoming, and the symptom enables the individual to avoid some noxious activity; it has been determined that the symptom is not under voluntary control; and the symptom cannot be explained by a known physical disorder or pathophysiologic mechanism. A 25-year old single white woman (para 0, gravida 1) was hospitalized for termination of pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation. The patient told her physician that she did not know she was pregnant. The operative procedure was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged. 5 days later she presented to the emergency room with the complaint that she was unable to void. Following catheterization, which recovered 800 mL of urine, the patient returned home. Within 24 hours she again complained of an inability to void. Admission to the gynecological service resulted in a 16-day stay involving a continued inability to void requiring repeated catheterizations. Psychiatric consultation revealed marked immaturity, an inappropriately labile affect, and indifference to her symptoms. A history of occasional substance abuse was elicited. Upon transfer to the psychiatric inpatient service, the patient began to void spontaneously. The reported incidence of psychiatric sequelae after therapeutic or legal abortion is low, but the degree of preabortion emotional difficulty appears in direct proportion to the incidence of postabortion behavioral complications. The selection of a target organ for conversion is often based upon its ability to achieve symbolic representation. In the case presented the anatomic proximity of the bladder and uterus is cogent with the Freudian concent of somatic compliance whereby a previous somatic injury or disease may dictate the conversion focus by reactivation of the original event.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is characterized by chronic subjective dizziness, phobic postural vertigo, and related disorders. For at least 3 months, it exhibits varying symptoms of vertigo, unsteadiness, or dizziness. Methods: Research articles regarding PPPD were searched by viewing the Scopus, PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases online. A search strategy using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis was used. Results: It presents a typical chronic vestibular system and brain malfunction that result in persistent dizziness, nonspinning vertigo, and/or unsteadiness. Persistent nonvertiginous dizziness and hypersensitivity to motion and visual stimuli are the main signs and symptoms of PPPD. These symptoms appeared either when there were no active neuro-otologic illnesses or when an episodic vestibular condition was present but could not completely account for the symptoms. Psychological mechanisms that resemble cognitive models of health anxiety and panic disorder are involved in the PPPDs development and maintenance. Conclusion: Since PPPDs diagnostic criteria only involve symptoms, the patient's clinical history is crucial in making the diagnosis. Once diagnosed, effective communication and personalized treatment plans, such as serotonergic medicines, cognitive behavioral therapy, and specialized physical therapy (vestibular rehabilitation), help manage PPPD. Since PPPD is a relatively recent clinical diagnosis, many medical practitioners who treat patients who feel dizzy are unfamiliar with it.",

However, stabilizing interventions to support emotion regulation should be given priority when the losses and the technique might not be appropriate for young children who have difficulty with the abstract processing required to take perspective on each loss. The term bereavement overload is used to refer to circumstances in which a grieving individual confronts multiple traumatic losses or in rapid succession, such that one loss cannot be accommodated before another occurs. Although this overload can be triggered by range of situations, the resulting bereavement complication can be the same: a complex and overwhelming fog of grief that leaves the survivor with unreality and helplessness sense. Feelings of helplessness, guilt about outliving other family members and diminished self-esteem are common responses to relentless progression for older adults who suffer from social isolation.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 6%. PTSD may develop at least one month after a traumatic event involving the threat of death or harm to physical integrity, although earlier symptoms may represent an acute stress disorder. Symptoms typically involve trauma-related intrusive thoughts, avoidant behaviors, negative alterations of cognition or mood, and changes in arousal and reactivity. Assessing for past trauma in patients with anxiety or other psychiatric illnesses may aid in diagnosing and treating PTSD. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., text revision provides diagnostic criteria, and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 uses these diagnostic criteria to help physicians diagnose PTSD and determine severity. First-line treatment of PTSD involves psychotherapy, such as trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy. Pharmacotherapy is useful for patients who have residual symptoms after psychotherapy or are unable or unwilling to access psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (i.e., fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline) and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine effectively treat primary PTSD symptoms. The addition of other pharmacotherapy, such as atypical antipsychotics or topiramate, may be helpful for residual symptoms. Patients with PTSD often have sleep disturbance related to hyperarousal or nightmares. Prazosin is effective for the treatment of PTSD-related sleep disturbance. Clinicians should consider testing patients with PTSD for obstructive sleep apnea because many patients with PTSD-related sleep disturbance have this condition. Psychiatric comorbidities, particularly mood disorders and substance use, are common in PTSD and are best treated concurrently.",

If an individual can cope successfully with the environmental challenge, little or no stress is experienced, the challenge is viewed as only minimal stressful and no major health consequences seem to arise. If an individual cannot cope or needs a great deal of effort to cope, stress is experienced, the environmental event becomes stressful and major health consequences seem to arise.

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

In rodent models of early-life stress, fragmentation and unpredictability of maternally derived sensory signals provoke persistent cognitive and emotional dysfunction in offspring. Similar variability and inconsistency of maternal signals during both gestation and early postnatal human life may influence development of emotional and cognitive functions, including those that underlie later depression and anxiety.",

Warning signsWhen symptoms are present for more than a month, cause diffi culties in functioning normally at a social, professional or other important level, or cause signifi cant suffering, it may be a PTSD.However, traumatic events do not cause PTSD in everyone who experiences them.Certain factors could lead to vulnerability to developing the disorder: having a biological fragility, having been the victim of physical or sexual abuse in the past, suffering from other mental health disorders [3], having had behavioral problems during childhood or adolescence or being subjected to chronic stressors.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT PURPOSE OF REVIEW Determining the etiology of disorders that manifest with chronic dizziness can seem a daunting task, but extracting some basic elements of the patient’s history can reduce the differential diagnosis significantly. This includes determining initial triggers, timing of symptoms, associated features, and exacerbating factors. This article covers distinct causes of chronic dizziness including persistent postural perceptual dizziness, mal de débarquement syndrome, motion sickness and visually induced motion sickness, bilateral vestibulopathy, and persistent dizziness after mild concussion. RECENT FINDINGS To date, none of the disorders above has a cure but are considered chronic syndromes with fluctuations that are both innate and driven by environmental stressors. As such, the mainstay of therapy for chronic disorders of dizziness involves managing factors that exacerbate symptoms and adding vestibular rehabilitation or cognitive-behavioral therapy alone or in combination, as appropriate. These therapies are supplemented by serotonergic antidepressants that modulate sensory gating and reduce anxiety. Besides expectation management, ruling out concurrent disorders and recognizing behavioral and lifestyle factors that affect symptom severity are critical issues in reducing morbidity for each disorder. SUMMARY Many syndromes of chronic dizziness can be diagnosed by recognition of key features, although many symptoms overlap between these groups. Symptoms may be manageable and improve with time, but they are often incompletely relieved.",

The interviewer should list and rate each obsession identified by the child using the Feelings Thermometer. Meanwhile, in assessing for compulsions, the frequency of the repetitive behavior is rated. Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder requires the presence of persistent obsessions, which are repetitive and difficult to control, and/or compulsions, or both (more than 1 hour each day). In addition, the symptoms must cause marked distress or cause significant interference in functioning. Recognition by the child that the symptoms are excessive or unreasonable is not necessary to make the diagnosis in children.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYIntroductionDepression and its symptoms are becoming one of the most importanthealth problems worldwide. The impact of depression on theproductive life of people, and the burden it represents because of itsco-morbidity, is growing. Some authors estimate that depression isthe second cause for the global loss of years of healthy life and thefirst one in developed countries.An increasing proportion of teenage population has mentalhealth issues. Depression and its symptoms are among the mostcommon, but they are not an epidemic problem yet, although spreadenough as to maintain interest in its current impact and in its negativeconsequences over individual health.Depression has a prominent place among mood disorders inMexico (4.5%), and women are who mostly suffer it (5.8%), whichhas remained consistent over time.Different difficult situations occur during adolescence along withdepression, depressive mood, and depressive symptoms. Thissituation may be related to changes and processes that occur duringthis period when individuals cope with situations they cannot handle,which in turn become stressful. Therefore, it is necessary to study andto work with adolescents in order to be able to differentiate affective,cognitive, somatic, and behavioral expressions, which are proper tothis stage, from those possibly caused by an illness that could havenegative consequences.Adolescent depression influences mood and the way individualslive unpleasant or annoying experiences, thus it affects almost everyaspect of life and becomes a risk factor for psychiatric and behavioralproblems. However, there are some areas that need more research,for example: the specific characteristics and expressions of the problemincluding gender comparisons and using designs with special groups.Data show that depression is growing in adolescents; thereforeit is a priority to work on detection and prevention to reduce its impacton mental health and to develop cost-effective intervention strategies.One way to do this is using valid-reliable screening tools becausethey are cheap, and methodologically-logistically useful.The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) has been used in different studies with Mexican adolescents, andhas proven to have good psychometric characteristics. The CES-Dhas never been used with an entire population in a great scale study.The objective of this paper is to measure the validity and reliability ofthe scale (construct, concurrent, and external validity, as well asinternal consistency) in a population of high school and collegefreshman students from Mexico City.MethodDesign. The study was a census made with high school and collegefreshman students during 2009. Data were collected in 22 schools.Population. A sample of 58568 students participated in thecensus. The mean age was 17 years old ( ±2.7). Most of the studentslived in homes with one to four other persons at the moment of thestudy (55.4%); 86% said that only their father worked at that moment,and 59.4 said that only the mother; 79.7% of the students lived withboth parents, and 17.9% only with their mother; 57403 students(98.0% of the population) completed the CES-D in the age range of14-24 years: 27264 (47.5%) men, and 30139 (52.5%) women.Instrument. The Automated Medical Examination (ExamenMedico Automatizado–EMA) is a diagnostic questionnaire designedby the General Directorate of Medical Services (Direccion Generalde Servicios Medicos) of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma deMexico (UNAM). It is a questionnaire with four self-report forms thatcollect information about the physical and mental health, the family,and the general context of every student. This information is used tocreate a diagnosis of vulnerability and a predictive profile fordeveloping prevention programs, as well as research protocols thathelp in promoting a culture for health care. The CES-D was includedfor the measurement in 2009.ResultsOverall internal consistency was adequate ( α=.83). Internal consistencywas tested by sex; the coefficient was higher for women ( α=.84). F actoranalysis generated a four-factor solution (explained variance 54.1%);each factor had good internal consistency and theoretical agreement.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Onset of genetically determined neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to specify because of their insidious and slowly progressive nature. This is especially true for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) because of varying affection of many parts of the nervous system and huge variability of symptoms. We investigated early symptoms in 287 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and calculated the influence of CAG repeat length on age of onset depending on (1) the definition of disease onset, (2) people defining onset, and (3) duration of symptoms. Gait difficulty was the initial symptom in two‐thirds of patients. Double vision, dysarthria, impaired hand writing, and episodic vertigo preceded ataxia in 4% of patients, respectively. Frequency of other early symptoms did not differ from controls and was regarded unspecific. Data about disease onset varied between patients and relatives for 1 year or more in 44% of cases. Influence of repeat length on age of onset was maximum when onset was defined as beginning of permanent gait disturbance and cases with symptoms for more than 10 years were excluded. Under these conditions, CAG repeat length determined 64% of onset variability in SCA1, 67% in SCA2, 46% in SCA3, and 41% in SCA6 demonstrating substantial influence of nonrepeat factors on disease onset in all SCA subtypes. Identification of these factors is of interest as potential targets for disease modifying compounds. In this respect, recognition of early symptoms that develop before onset of ataxia is mandatory to determine the shift from presymptomatic to affected status in SCA. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",

Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen. Die Integration psychosozialer Faktoren im diagnostischen Prozess und eine psychosomatische Betreuung der RDS-PatientInnen sind daher besonders wichtig.

The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disorder in children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

      "title": "The multifactorial aetiology and management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder with leuprorelin acetate",
      "abstract": "Up to 18% of women of reproductive age may experience symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or its more severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). A plethora of symptoms have been described, but both are commonly associated with other mood-related disorders such as major depression causing significant life impairment. Originally known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in the DSM-III-R ( American Psychiatric Association 1987 ), the syndrome was renamed PMDD in the DSM-IV ( American Psychiatric Association 1994 ). Between 3% and 8% of women meet the diagnostic criteria for PMDD. Currently, there is no consensus on its aetiology although it is thought to be multifactorial. Biological, genetic, psychological, environmental and social factors have all been suggested. However, an altered sensitivity to the normal hormonal fluctuations that influence functioning of the central nervous system is thought most likely. PMDD is identified in the DSM-5 by the presence of at least five symptoms accompanied by significant psychosocial or functional impairment. During evaluation, it is recommended that clinicians confirm symptoms by prospective patient mood charting for at least two menstrual cycles. Management options include psychotropic agents, ovulation suppression and dietary modification. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered primary therapy for psychological symptoms. Ovulation suppression is another option with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) or GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists. Rarely symptoms warrant a bilateral oophorectomy and a 6-month trial of GnRH agonists prior to surgery may be prudent to determine its potential efficacy. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her mid-30s experiencing severe symptoms during the luteal phase of her menstrual cycle. A trial of the contraceptive pill and SSRIs were unsuccessful. Treatment with leuprorelin acetate (Prostap) improved her symptoms. She therefore elected to undergo a bilateral oophorectomy with resolution of her symptoms. She started hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This case demonstrates the multifactorial aetiology of PMDD and the challenges in its management. Women with PMDD suffer functional impairments comparable with other depressive disorders and yet PMDD and its impact remain under-recognised. As the psychological nature and consequences of PMDD often seem indistinguishable from symptoms of other mental health difficulties, this condition presents distinct diagnostic challenges for healthcare professionals. It is crucial to establish the correct diagnosis using clearly defined criteria because if it is left untreated, it can cause considerable impairment to the woman’s quality of life.",

The average time of occurrence of psychotic symptoms in our 3 cases after beginning of MAP abuse was two or three years. 2.) Although the psychotic states (often schizophrenia-like) were stable for a short time, the symptoms recurred promptly after reinjection of a small amount of MAP, unspecific stress or drinking sake (flashback phenomenon). The recurrence may happen even after several years. 3.) In cases of chronic MAP-P disturbances of consciousness are rare. Chronic process of MAP-P cases may show acute transient disturbances of consciousness (flashback phenomenon). 4.) The change of affects and behaviour ranges between irritable and indifferent attitudes. While there are close connections between the disturbance of feeling and change of personality (Wesensänderung), it is very difficult to decide whether premorbid character traits are dominant or there is a change of personality or emotional disturbance. 5.) About acute psychic symptoms which are responsible for recurrence of MAP-P, MAP-abusers make the experience that their intimate personal affairs are overlooked and become public (uncovered defensive experiences). In chronic cases of MAP-P we often meet patients with hypertrophic self-feeling or delusion of grandeur predominant in the symptomatology. 6.) In our cases sensations were amalgamated into each other and there were hallucinatory experiences without clear division between them. 7.) In chronic cases the auditory hallucinations criticized or censured the patients for their behaviour. Thought echoing (Gedankenlautwerden) was found. We found signs of mind reading (Gedankenausbreitung).",

Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as an altered brain structure or function produced by an external force. Adults surviving moderate and severe TBI often experience long-lasting neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPS). NPS can occur as primary psychiatric complications or could be an exacerbation of pre-existing compensated conditions. It has been shown that changes in behavior following moderate to severe TBI have a prevalence rate of 25–88%, depending on the methodology used by the different studies. Most of current literature has found that cognitive behavioral and emotional deficit following TBI occurs within the first six months whereas after 1–2 years the condition becomes stable. Identifying the risk factors for poor outcome is the first step to reduce the sequelae. Patients with TBI have an adjusted relative risk of developing any NPS several-fold higher than in the general population after six months of moderate–severe TBI. All NPS features of an individual’s life, including social, working, and familiar relationships, may be affected by the injury, with negative consequences on quality of life. This overview aims to investigate the most frequent psychiatric, behavioral, and emotional symptoms in patients suffering from TBI as to improve the clinical practice and tailor a more specific rehabilitation training.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Biologically, an MS relapse (flare, exacerbation, attack) is defined as a clinical worsening due to a new or expanding area of CNS inflammation. Clinically, the change in neurologic symptoms and signs should persist for more than 48 hours. Only two conditions have been persuasively linked to an increased risk of relapses. These are the period 2 to 6 months postpartum, when a woman’s immune system readjusts to normal,1–4 and the period 1 to 5 weeks following an infection, usually a viral infection.5,6 The reason for the latter phenomenon is not known but is believed to result from a stimulation of the immune system following its response to the infectious agent. Making the diagnosis of an MS relapse can be difficult. Many factors can contribute to a worsening of symptoms and signs in persons with MS that are not the result of new CNS inflammation. Worsening of signs and symptoms resulting from non–MS-related disease processes is called a “pseudorelapse” or “pseudo-exacerbation.” These phenomena should always be considered before diagnosing a true MS attack. Some of the most common and important non-MS causes of increased symptoms and signs are noted in Table 7.1.",

A retrospective clinical file audit was used to identify the clinical manifestation of BPD for the first time at or above the age of 30, and to examine whether particular clinical and psychosocial factors may be associated with a later-in-life manifestation of BPD. Twenty-three cases of late manifestation BPD were identified. People with late manifestation of BPD had similar risk factors and vulnerabilities, including childhood trauma, to the broader BPD population. They were distinguished by having higher levels of education, employment, and long-term intimate relationships. Interpersonal problems, loss of employment and reminders of past sexual trauma were key precipitating factors. The findings underscore the legitimacy of a late-manifestation diagnosis of BPD by demonstrating that BPD does not present exclusively during adolescence and early adulthood. BPD may present for the first time in later life in response to loss of protective factors or triggering of past trauma. This understanding may reduce misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, prescription of inappropriate treatments or delays in receiving BPD-appropriate treatments.",

The state represents the acute stage of fear, anxiety and trauma and generally occurs in mental disorders, such as trauma- and stress-related disorders, but it can also manifest in healthy individuals as the initial trigger response, the point of mental dysregulation. The mental state of terror can be specified with the following parameters: (1) perceived loss of safety, (2) unpredictability and uncertainty, (3) intense consequent emotional reaction, (4) hypersensitivity to the trigger stimuli, and consequentially, (5) the outcome that can be either negative, such as resulting in developing a mental disorder, or positive, such as developing post-traumatic growth and resilience. Behavioural biases are also a for factor the development of the mental state of terror. The aim of this theoretical contribution is to define the mental state of terror in terms of cognitive factors, such as exposure to traumatic events and uncertainty of the environment for understanding the development of mental disorders within stress and trauma domains; highlight the importance of psychological resilience and social support.",

      "title": "Long-term changes in cognitive bias and coping response as a result of chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence",
      "abstract": "Animals that experience adverse events in early life often have life-long changes to their physiology and behavior. Long-term effects of stress during early life have been studied extensively, but less attention has been given to the consequences of negative experiences solely during the adolescent phase. Adolescence is a particularly sensitive period of life when regulation of the glucocorticoid \"stress\" hormone response matures and specific regions in the brain undergo considerable change. Aversive experiences during this time might, therefore, be expected to generate long-term consequences for the adult phenotype. Here we investigated the long-term effects of exposure to chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence on adult decision-making, coping response, cognitive bias, and exploratory behavior in rats. Rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (e.g., isolation, crowding, cage tilt) were compared to control animals that were maintained in standard, predictable conditions throughout development. Unpredictable stress during adolescence resulted in a suite of long-term behavioral and cognitive changes including a negative cognitive bias [F (1, 12) = 5.000, P < 0.05], altered coping response [T (1, 14) = 2.216, P = 0.04], and accelerated decision-making [T (1, 14) = 3.245, P = 0.01]. Exposure to chronic stress during adolescence also caused a short-term increase in boldness behaviors; in a novel object test 15 days after the last stressor, animals exposed to chronic unpredictable stress had decreased latencies to leave a familiar shelter and approach a novel object [T (1, 14) = 2.240, P = 0.04; T (1, 14) = 2.419, P = 0.03, respectively]. The results showed that stress during adolescence has long-term impacts on behavior and cognition that affect the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli, behavioral response to adverse events, and how animals make decisions.",

      "title": "Disorders of Emotion",
      "abstract": "It is customary to distinguish between feelings and emotions. A feeling can be defined as a positive or negative reaction to some experience or event and is the subjective or experiential aspect of emotion. By contrast, emotion is a stirred-up state caused by physiological changes occurring as a response to some event and which tends to maintain or abolish the causative event. The feelings may be those of depression, anxiety, fear and so on. Mood is a pervasive and sustained emotion that colours the person's perception of the world. Descriptions of mood should include intensity, duration and fluctuations as well as adjectival descriptions of the type. Affect, meaning short-lived emotion, is defined as the patient's present emotional responsiveness. It is what the doctor infers from the patient's body language, including facial expression, and it may or may not be congruent with mood. It is described as being within normal range, constricted, blunt or flat.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

      "abstract": "Stress is crucial to the survival of an organism, but excessive stress can lead to psychological disorders including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicidality. The prevailing notion is that chronic stress promotes adverse outcomes on brain and body health, whereas acute stressors are generally benign. Notably, acute events such mass shootings or natural disasters are now emerging as significant sources of cognitive and emotional problems including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These events are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of physical, emotional, and social stresses, which last minutes to hours. Hence, there is a need to model such multiple concurrent acute stresses (MAS) to uncover the mechanisms by which they lead to profound adverse outcomes. The MAS paradigm described here involves simultaneously exposing a rodent to several different stressors including restraint, crowding, and jostling alongside peers in a brightly lit and very noisy environment. Moreover, the MAS paradigm can be used once or imposed repeatedly to emulate complex, repeated modern life stresses, advancing our mechanistic understanding of consequent mental and cognitive impairments.",

      "abstract": "Article Abstract A diagnosis of bipolar disorder is difficult to make when a depressed patient can provide no evidence of having experienced mania or hypomania, either because the elevated mood states are not recognized as periods of illness or because depression is the initial episode and the patient has yet to experience the other polarity of the disorder. In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

Bei Menschen bis zum 75. oder 80. Lebensjahr (drittes Lebensalter) liegen zahlreiche psychoanalytische Behandlungserfahrungen vor. Depressionen haben in diesem Alter, insbesondere, wenn sie durch aktuelle Lebenskrisen ausgelost wurden, eine positive Behandlungsprognose. Bei den uber 80jahrigen (viertes Lebensalter) stehen zunehmend die korperlichen Alterungsprozesse im Vordergrund. Hierzu sind bisher nur psychoanalytisch orientierte klinische Therapieerfahrungen publiziert worden, da oft besondere Settingbedingungen notwendig sind, so das weiterer Forschungsbedarf besteht.",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

      "abstract": "Lives can be severely disrupted after a momentous negative experience. Particularly potent are unexpected negative events, or “traumas,” such as a near death experience, a severe injury, or being exposed to intense interpersonal violence or a natural disaster. Although most people recover from these traumatic events, many do not, and experience persistent fear, anxiety and/or depression following the event. In the past, these maladaptations after trauma were considered to be a reflection of personal weaknesses and were stigmatized. Now, after 30 years of research, the physiological responses to severe stress and trauma are being increasingly understood, as are the risk factors for a pathological response to trauma. These gains from the study of memory and neurohormonal reactivity and control systems hold forth the promise of improved, biologically-informed, psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions for the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the future.",

Relapse on medication is associated with acute stress in the form of life events and chronic stress in the form of the emotional atmosphere in the patient's home. The noxious elements in the emotional atmosphere have been identified as criticism, hostility, and overinvolvement by the relatives. Strategies are discussed for reducing the level of these emotions and their effect on the patients. A preliminary report is given on the progress of a controlled trial of social intervention with patients at high risk of relapse.",

Pain may be the most significant problem, more disabling than any brain or other injuries, and interfering with aspects of cognition or other function. However, posttraumatic headache and most other chronic posttraumatic pain problems remain poorly understood. This article reviews fundamental issues that should be considered in understanding the nature of chronic pain including the distinction between acute and chronic pain; neurobiological distinctions between the lateral and medial pain system; nociceptive versus neuropathic or other central pain; sensitization effects; the widely accepted view of chronic pain as a multidimensional subjective experience involving sensory, motivational-affective and cognitive-behavioral components; the problem of mind-body dualism; the role of psychosocial factors in the onset, maintenance, exacerbation or severity of pain; plus issues of response bias and malingering.",

A concussion is a complex pathophysiologic process, with or without loss of consciousness, that results in a disturbance of brain function. Risk factors include age &lt;18 years, female sex, and history of a previous concussion. A sideline physical examination with standardized assessment tools can assist diagnosis. Management for suspected concussion begins with immediate removal from play and requires clinical follow-up. Symptoms are usually self-limited and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Initial treatment consists of a reduction in cognitive activity and physical rest. A stepwise return-to-play protocol, taking into consideration state laws, with a gradual increase in activity until the athlete is able to perform full activity without symptoms should be followed. Neuropsychologic testing may be used as a tool in management. For prolonged concussion, physical rehabilitation or medications for headaches, mood, or sleep disturbance may be required. Education, rule changes, and equipment improvements may assist in prevention. The long-term consequences of concussions are not fully understood and merit additional research.",

      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

The event is then persistently re-experienced. The person avoids stimuli associated with the trauma and experiences a numbing of general responsiveness. Symptoms of increased arousal can occur as well as depression and anxiety. PTSD causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The general practitioner is uniquely placed to identify PTSD and can have a key role in treatment. Cognitive behavioural treatment is a central therapeutic approach and can be carried out in general practice. The issues are to counteract the physiological components, expose the patient to the feared situation and help the patient to relearn that the stimuli are not necessarily associated with danger or threat. Repeated brief consultations over time can facilitate this process.",

      "abstract": "This article describes a proposal for the new diagnosis of chronic primary pain (CPP) in ICD-11. Chronic primary pain is chosen when pain has persisted for more than 3 months and is associated with significant emotional distress and/or functional disability, and the pain is not better accounted for by another condition. As with all pain, the article assumes a biopsychosocial framework for understanding CPP, which means all subtypes of the diagnosis are considered to be multifactorial in nature, with biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to each. Unlike the perspectives found in DSM-5 and ICD-10, the diagnosis of CPP is considered to be appropriate independently of identified biological or psychological contributors, unless another diagnosis would better account for the presenting symptoms. Such other diagnoses are called \"chronic secondary pain\" where pain may at least initially be conceived as a symptom secondary to an underlying disease. The goal here is to create a classification that is useful in both primary care and specialized pain management settings for the development of individualized management plans, and to assist both clinicians and researchers by providing a more accurate description of each diagnostic category.",

The etiology of this illness is unlikely to be a single agent. Findings to date suggest that physiological and psychological factors work together to predispose and perpetuate the illness. Diagnosis is made difficult by the nonspecific clinical findings and no available diagnostic testing. With no known cause or cure for the chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome, treatment is based on relieving symptoms and improving the quality of life of affected patients. There is emerging evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome may be familial. In the future, studies will examine the extent to which genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of chronic fatigue syndrome. Most patients with CFS have psychiatric problems such as a generalized anxiety disorder, or major or minor depression, therefore, these mental health disorders may be correlated with the pathophysiology of the CFS. The treatment for CFS must be individualized, due to the heterogeneity of the CFS population. Also the treatment of CFS is built on a foundation of patient-physician relationship, respect and advocacy.",

The phenomenon of becoming ill on weekends and/or during vacation has been termed \"leisure sickness\". Attempts to understand this problem can be found in the current literature. Vacation for the wrong motivations or a mismatch between leisure activity and personality are some of the reasons. Other reports show associations between similar health-affecting patterns and personality traits or increased stress, but these factors have not been directly linked to leisure sickness before. Indeed, leisure sickness is not a specific defined illness yet but is more an accumulation of different symptoms that lead to indisposition. If leisure sickness is not only a phenomenon but is actually a real illness, it is seriously preventing people from the benefits of leisure time on the one hand and directly affects vacation experience with respect to destination, hotel and other tourism products on the other hand. Therefore, leisure sickness deserves further investigation.",

Diagnosis should include not only type, degree and extent of motor handicap, but also intelligence, personality factors, sensory deficits, seizures and other physical problems. Diagnosis depends on detecting deviations from normal growth and development, of being aware of a multitude of progressive and other lesions which may simulate, at least early, the \"static\" group of conditions characterized by motor deficit due to central nervous system disease. Management involves early positioning, use of special equipment (mainly improvised), sensory stimulation and experience, as well as motor training, evaluation of intelligence and special learning situations to assist in discrimination learning and lengthening of attention span. Nursery schools for mentally capable children from 18 months to 3 years of age assist in developing independence, maturity and growth of personality. Except for patients with very severe mental or physical involvement, competitive employment in adult life is not related so much to the physical handicap as to personality characteristics, traits which are formed in early years.",

      "title": "Premenstrual syndrome: A modern view on the problem",
      "abstract": "Most women of reproductive age (about 80%) experience premenstrual symptoms, which indicate the approaching menstruation and are of little clinical significance, since they do not affect the quality of life. However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

      "title": "The Role of Neuro-Immune Interaction in Chronic Pain Conditions; Functional Somatic Syndrome, Neurogenic Inflammation, and Peripheral Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

She was treated for anxiety disorder and reaction to severe stress in our clinic for 1 year. Five days after husband’s nursing home placement our patient developed the abnormal thought, that someone might tell her neighbou rs of her laziness and failures. She believed that she was under constant surveillance. These ideas grew rapidly into delusions and hallucinations. She was diagnosed as having transient psychosis with associated acute stress and was treated with risperidone. The psychosis lasted for two months. Careful differential diagnosis is necessary in the cases of transient psychosis. Psychotic symptoms in overloaded individuals may be more common than was previously thought.",

      "title": "Is Personality Profile a Relevant Determinant of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis?",
      "abstract": "The origin and pathophysiological background of MS-associated fatigue is poorly understood. There is no unifying concept of its nature and its determinants to date. This paper reviews possible influences of factors determining personality profile on mental fatigue in MS. Likewise, the role of psychological factors and their interaction with personality to promote fatigue is discussed. Current data suggests that fatigue, especially in early MS states, may be influenced by vulnerable personality traits and personality-associated features. Among them are depressive disease coping, avoidance behavior and inhibition, irritability, less extraversion, neuroticism, disturbed reward responsiveness and somatization behavior. However, among the validated personality factors no genuine influences that are independent of depression have been documented. From a psychological perspective, depressiveness, anxiety and perhaps somatization may be relevant mediators of fatigue. Interesting to note that in early MS a psychiatric diagnosis is significantly more likely than on a later stage of the disease and that fatigue and motivation might share neural circuits. It is hypothesized that psychological factors promote fatigue in MS by psychological distress and sustained neuro-endocrine and neurovegetative stress response. Despite there are limitations of data as discussed in the paper, personality research might help to disentangle specific promoting factors of fatigue in MS. Further research efforts are warranted since they might open ways to early psychological intervention of MS-associated fatigue. This is all the more important since medication is insufficient until now.",

      "title": "Exploring the Trauma Experiences of Homeless Families: A Literature Synthesis",
      "abstract": "“Trauma” comes from the Greek word meaning “wound” as in a physical injury to the body. Only in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did trauma take on the psychological connotations we attach to the word today. From experiences of trauma resulting from a single event to complex trauma resulting from extended, repeated traumatic events, the effects of trauma can be long-lasting and negatively affect both mental and physical health. \r\n\r\nFamilies experiencing homelessness constitute 33% of the total homeless population. Homelessness itself presents numerous challenges, but many families also struggle to cope with problems that preceded homelessness and/or that may compound it. This literature synthesis explores trauma in the lives of homeless families. The findings suggest that the trauma histories of homeless families are quite extensive and include abuse and neglect as children as well as intimate partner violence in adulthood. Children in homeless families often witness abuse suffered by their caregivers. In terms of the impact of trauma, depression, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other psychiatric disorders are not uncommon among homeless mothers. Children are similarly negatively affected. They may experience internalizing and/or externalizing problems. Internalizing problems include depression, anxiety, and PTSD whereas externalizing problems include aggression and other behavioral problems.\r\n\r\nThere are many interventions designed to help members of families who have experienced traumatic events. However, homeless families may not be able to take advantage of such offerings because of housing instability. While it is certainly important for homeless families to eventually receive trauma-related interventions, what can be done at the point of homelessness? One option is for providers of services to the homeless to follow trauma-informed practices, which are outlined as part of this literature synthesis.\r\n\r\nHomelessness in and of itself is a significant public health problem. For example, homelessness is associated with physical and mental health problems and barriers to accessing care. With respect to trauma and homelessness, the severity of trauma symptoms is predictive of long-term housing instability for families. Thus, it is important to address trauma among homeless families to help keep them out of shelters and other unstable living situations.",

Between 14% and 29% of children with mild traumatic brain injury will continue to have postconcussion symptoms at 3 months, but the pathophysiological mechanisms driving this is poorly understood. The relative contribution of injury factors to postconcussion syndrome decreases over time and, instead, premorbid factors become important predictors of symptom persistence by 3 to 6 months postinjury. The differential diagnoses include headache disorder, cervical injury, anxiety, depression, somatization, vestibular dysfunction, and visual dysfunction. The long-term outcome for most children is good, although there is significant morbidity in the short term. Management strategies target problematic symptoms such as headaches, sleep and mood disturbances, and cognitive complaints.",

Rather, they are warning cues to vulnerability to somatic illness and supplementary to the risk factors derived from physical data. The list of vulnerability cues includes exposure to stress. This is an alerting cue; past modes of reaction to stress in the form of physical patterns (but not conversion reactions); regressive shifts of defenses in the direction of resomatization; mounting aggression that is not directly verbalized; diminution of psychologically expressed guilt, though guilt would be expected and indeed becomes manifest in physical form; psychological versions of transference reactions replaced by expressions in body language; dreams in which stimuli from early physical dysfunction are recurrently part of the daily residue and give a somatic cast to current conflicts; identification with important objects that is increasingly expressed in somatic terms. These cues tend to be accompanied by a growing perception of, and preoccupation with, the body. The more such indicators are present and noted, the greater their usefulness in predicting physical illness.",

Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) does not list malingering in its diagnostic section and therefore does not identify it as a formal mental disorder, malingering and verified mental illness commonly coexist. Some subtypes of feigning behaviors, such as partial or pure malingering, dissimulation, and false imputation, can be suspected when patients have marked discrepancies between reported stressors and objective findings. The article discusses these three theoretical concepts with their possible clinical aspects, illustrating each phenomenon by clinical case with self-reported and/or observed psychotic symptoms.

The symptoms must persist for at least one month. Many children with SM also have excessive shyness, poor eye contact, and fear of embarrassment. Despite the failure to speak, the child’s nonverbal communication ability is typically age appropriate and prosocial nonverbal communication such as nodding or giggling is often observed. Since SM frequently co-occurs with other communication disorders, the assessment should include a hearing and speech and language evaluation. Behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the primary treatments for SM.

      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a term applied to individuals who report severe chronic fatigue out of proportion to their efforts, but the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Fourth and Fifth Editions, are clear that no ratable impairment is linked to CFS. Chronic fatigue is not synonymous with CFS; only a small fraction of persons who present with chronic fatigue symptoms meet the criteria for CFS; and CFS, like fibromyalgia and multiple chemical sensitivity, is poorly understood. CFS may be associated with disability but primarily is based on psychological rather than physical symptoms. No tests confirm the diagnosis of CFS, and routine laboratory testing is reserved for excluding other medical conditions. CFS is an illness without a disease and often is characterized by illness behavior expressed as somatization. To date, no convincing evidence supports the notion that CFS is an infectious, neuroendocrine, or immunologic disorder. Thus, sophisticated behavioral assessment is critical and may include a fatigue rating scale, a depression scale, and psychological and personality inventories. No specific treatment has been recommended for CFS treatment, but cognitive and behavioral interventions may be useful to address psychological symptoms; medication is reserved for specific symptoms indicative of depression or anxiety.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome—Psychiatric or Gynaecological Disorder?",
      "abstract": "The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of mental and physical symptoms arising in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms disappear after the onset of menstruation. During the rest of the follicular phase the patient is free from symptoms. The cyclical nature of the symptom variations is characteristic of the syndrome. The lack of a commonly accepted definition and a way to diagnose PMS has led to contradictory results in the search for its aetiology and treatment. The diagnosis of PMS should be based on prospective daily ratings of symptoms and defined criteria of subgroups. In our studies three subgroups can be identified. The \"Pure PMS\" group with significant cyclical symptoms being worse during the luteal phase and no symptoms during the follicular phase. A \"Premenstrual aggravation\" group with symptoms always present but with an aggravation premenstrually. A \"Non-PMS\" group of women who do not suffer from menstrual cycle related symptoms. These three groups show significant differences in the number of patients with an earlier psychiatric history and are different in the extent of neurosis on a personality test. The Pure PMS group had less neurosis and a lower frequency of patients with an earlier psychiatric history. In anovulatory cycles, whether induced or spontaneous, the cyclical nature of symptoms disappeared. This shows the important role that the corpus luteum has in precipitating symptoms in PMS. GnRH-agonists can be used to induce anovulation and this will stop the cyclical changes. Postmenopausal women receiving oestradiol/progestagen sequential treatment develop PMS-like symptoms when progestagen is added to the treatment. Symptoms seem to be dose dependent related to the oestradiol during the luteal but not the folicular phase. The intracerebral effects that cause the symptoms are still unknown. Progesterone metabolites have, however, been shown to interact with the GABA-A receptor in a similar manner to benzodiazepins and barbiturates, and they also have anxiolytic effects. Progesterone metabolites may occur which have the opposite effect on the GABA-A receptor, producing anxiogenic effects.",

Anxiety disorders are psychiatric disorders commonly encountered in the elderly and correlate with increased health burden, morbidity, mortality, and poor quality of life. The elderly with cardiovascular and multimorbid diseases are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety disorders. This disorder can be a continuation of previous occurrences or a first-time event. The interaction between neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors triggers the onset of this disorder. Diagnosis enforcement is often challenging due to comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as depression or cognitive disorders, as well as the similarity of anxiety symptoms to symptoms caused by other medical conditions or aging. The elderly find it difficult to accurately describe and identify anxiety. Expertise is required to establish an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, this disorder often does not receive proper treatment, even though optimal management is crucial to improving outcomes and achieving optimal quality of life in the elderly. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches require special attention due to the impact of aging on organ function.

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder caused by experiencing or witnessing traumatic or potentially life-threatening events, that has grown in prevalence due to global conflicts, natural disasters, and domestic violence. When a victim experiences trauma such as death or serious injury, three dimensions of PTSD develop: re-experience the event, Symptoms of trauma may include distressing memories, dreams, flashbacks, and physical distress, as well as avoidance of triggers and increased arousal. Traumatic events cause stress, which leads to a variety of psychosocial and physiological outcomes. PTSD has significant psychobiological correlates that can impair a person's daily life and be life-threatening. Given current events (for example, extended combat, terrorism, and exposure to certain environmental toxins), a significant increase in PTSD diagnoses is expected over the next decade. PTSD is a serious public health concern, necessitating the development of new paradigms and theoretical models to gain a better understanding of the condition and develop new and improved treatment interventions. therefore, understanding the specific causes of PTSD and how it affects patients is critical for both clinical practice and scientific research. To treat PTSD, nonpharmacologic interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), antianxiety medications, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics are recommended. This review of PTSD will help readers gain a better understanding of the PTSD condition and probable causes that contribute to PTSD disease and explore the influence on the patient himself after suffering from PTSD. It discusses the ways to improve the ability to recognize and treat it, appreciate the internist's role in managing it, and help to enhance the quality of life of people suffering from PTSD.",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

The literature fails to present discriminant validity of chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to undifferentiated somatoform disorder. A critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder but absent from the definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome: some patients experience their fatigue as being exclusively physical and not as mental, which is prima facie peculiar, for fatigue is necessarily a mental experience. One is not able to experience fatigue without a mind (or a brain). This experience is characterized as a ‘mindless’ fatigue, underpinned by pathological reductionist thinking. By not recognizing this critical feature, diagnostic endeavours may perpetuate the problem as a function of the patient's difficulty. Summary Proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome should distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome from undifferentiated somatoform disorder, if chronic fatigue syndrome is a distinct entity at all. Further, the ‘mindless’ quality is a critical feature that needs consideration in refining the concept of undifferentiated somatoform disorder.",

      "abstract": "The field of traumatic stress is often referred to as being in a state of controversy and lack of continuity. Throughout history, disputes repeatedly centered on defining the psychological consequences of severe adverse events and on their causes. Even to this day this is current. To understand these controversies, an extensive historical literature review is presented of how mental consequences of trauma have been described in history, of the circumstances in which this took place, and of the disputes that have influenced the conceptualization of these mental responses. We found psychotrauma always being surrounded by controversy. Significant heterogeneity in symptom expression has been described over the centuries to this day. Some symptoms appeared steadily over many decades, but often each time period showed its own core symptoms. At syndrome level, we found an acute condition, one with longer duration, and a complex condition. Also here, definitions varied over the decades. Finally, causes have always been debated, such as biological, psychological, socio-economic, cultural, political, or legal. To better reflect the described ongoing variation in symptomatology, a more flexible diagnostic approach is proposed with a combination of both staging and subtyping that offers room for a more flexible, symptom-oriented, and personalized perspective.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and complex disorder precipitated by exposure to a psychologically distressing event. PTSD first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980,1,,2 arising from studies of the Vietnam war, and of civilian victims of natural and man-made disasters.3,,4 However, the study of PTSD dates back more than 100 years. Before 1980, post-traumatic syndromes were recognized by different names, including railway spine, shell shock, traumatic (war) neurosis, concentration-camp syndrome, and rape-trauma syndrome.2,,3 The symptoms described in these syndromes overlap considerably with what we now recognize as PTSD. According to the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-IV-TR),5 the essential feature of PTSD is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor characterized by: direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person reacts to this event with fear and helplessness, and tries to avoid being reminded of it. Traumatic events include military combat, violent personal assault, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration, natural or man-made disasters, automobile accidents, or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. The principal symptoms of PTSD are the painful re-experiencing of the event, a pattern of avoidance and emotional numbing, and fairly constant hyperarousal.\n\nPost-traumatic reactions fall on a continuum, and many clinicians and researchers believe it is useful to conceptualize partial symptoms as well.2, …",

      "title": "Prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Northern India",
      "abstract": "Irritable syndrome (IBS) is a recurrent disorder characterised by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort (often bloating), in association with altered generation and interpretation of function, which is not accompanied by anatomical anomalies or biochemical abnormalities. Symptoms tend to vary in manifestation and time course, worsen during flares, and affect patient's quality of life.1 A dysregulation of the brain-gut axis that interacts with visceral hypersensitivity and associated with observed digestive motor disturbances and micro-inflammation of the gut, with possibly an imbalance of the intestinal bio-flora. These are factors that may be responsible for the symptoms generation. Psychosocial stressors may then interact with biological factors and are modulated by cultural beliefs and practices resulting in variations on observed symptoms constellation and health seeking behaviours, a biopsychosocial disorder.\r\n\r\nA better outcome is achievable if a positive diagnosis of IBS is made, based on clinical symptoms (in the absence of alarm signs) alone, rather than making a diagnosis by exclusion. Several diagnostic exist and each new criterion refers to the insufficiencies of the previous ones. The most commonly accepted diagnostic include the original Manning and the subsequent series of foundation defined criteria. A formal definition according to the Rome III is recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per month during the previous 3 months associated with two or more of the following with onset at least 6 months before diagnosis: (1) symptoms improvement with defecation, (2) onset associated with a change in the frequency of stools and (3) onset associated with a change in form or appearance of stools.1-4\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of IBS varies across the world, ranging from as high as 10%-20% in the West,5,6 to as low as 4.2% in India.7 There is a perception that IBS is less of a problem in Asia and its epidemiology to be different. In addition, the prevalence rates of IBS itself vary in Asia with higher rates being documented from more affluent urban communities of Japan, Singapore and Guangzhou in China.8-10 Prevalence rates also differ within the same country (Beijing 7.3% and Guangzhou 12%) and within the same racial community from different countries.8,11,12 Such observed differences may be due to the different (Manning vs Rome II vs Rome III) used to diagnose IBS or due to a different target population studied. However more recently, Park et al13 reported similar prevalence rates using Rome II (8%) and Rome III (9%) in a Korean IBS population.\r\n\r\nIn this study Makharia et al reported a prevalence rate of 4% which is in good agreement (4.2%) with a previous study by Ghoshal et al.7 This is interesting as the population involved in both studies were quite different. Ghoshal looked at subjects from mainly the hospital/clinic setting (recruitment centres from Northern, Central and Southern India) while the present study was solely community based (Northern India). Furthermore Makharia's group used a questionnaire based on the new Rome III module while Ghoshal's local criteria was more clinical and practical. Yet the resulting prevalence rates from both centers were quite similar. The observed prevalence rate is low compared to data from other Asian centers and also lower than the Western prevalence rates. We would expect lower prevalence rates from a rural community in Northern India, as IBS is recognized to be a disorder of developed nations and communities.8-10 However, Ghoshal's hospital based study confirmed that the prevalence rate is indeed low in India.\r\n\r\nOne possible explanation for the low prevalence rate could be from the use of different diagnostic tools or for the detection of a variable condition that is solely symptom based. One of the weaknesses of this study is that the used questionnaire was not validated for the study population. This might affect the quality of data acquired. However, a study from Nam et al14 using validated Rome III in Korea gave a prevalence rate of 8.2% which is still lower than the prevalence rates observed from communities in Europe or America.\r\n\r\nAnother unique observation is the much higher incidence of diarrhea predominant IBS (1.5%) compared to IBS constipation (0.3%). This was also reported from Ghoshal's study who also suggested that in general, Indians tend to pass 1-2 soft stool per day. This may be due to the higher fiber intake and faster gut transit time. Is it possible that another form of functional bowel or IBS exist in this sub-continent which is different from the West? Western patients tend to be more neurotic compared to the Asian patients who are more likely to be post infectious. This difference may also arise from other contributing factors such as race, different cultural practices, variation in food intake and co-existing lactose intolerance.\r\n\r\nThe other notable difference reported from this study is the increasing prevalence of IBS with advancing age, with the maximum in the 50-60 age groups. Across Asia, it has been noted that the prevalence of IBS is higher in the younger age group.8,9,11,12,15,16 In a rural community where the younger folks need to work hard for daily sustenance, symptoms of abdominal discomfort or alteration of pattern is often too trivial to be considered as abnormal enough to visit the hospital. The time of day in which the study was conducted in this native rural community of Northern India would also be important.\r\n\r\nThe often quoted male preponderance in Asian Indian IBS population was not demonstrated in this study. The prevalence of IBS was significantly higher in females compared with males. In the previous study by Ghoshal et al7 the subset of complainants in the study group showed a distinct predominance of male gender (68% vs 32%). The explanation given by the authors is that in a male dominant society, the health seeking behaviour of males can best account for the disparity in prevalence rates seen in the hospital/clinic setting compared to a rural community setting.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this study by Makharia et al is the first large scale IBS study in India using the Rome III criteria. However, this study has few limitations. Firstly, the diagnostic tool used, the Rome III questionnaire was not validated for this population. Secondly, it was also noted that the Glasgow pictorial stool chart was not used to determine stool forms. Even if patients can describe their stool forms adequately, pictorial definition is still the best method of evaluation since patient's perception is often very different from the actual stool form. Despite all of these, this study has contributed to a better understanding of the epidemiology of IBS in India, by providing an alternative view point to the more accepted norms.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

      "title": "Correlation of Stigma with Self-compassion in Patients with Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background & Aims: The bipolar disorder is important mental disorder, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression.This chronic and complex disease affects the mood of the patient, causing continuous and abnormal mood changes from extremely good to extremely poor and depressed.These fluctuations often last for weeks or months.Frequent episodes of depression and mania affect the functioning of the individual in personal, professional, family, social, and cultural domains.Patients with the bipolar disorder experience a phenomenon known as stigma.Stigma is defined as a set of cognitions and behaviors that are activated by labeling, leading to social exclusion and isolation.The stigma of mental illness distinguishes the patients from other populations.The stigma of mental illness renders the patients incapacitated and socially isolated.In addition, the experience of stigma decreases the quality of life and health-seeking behaviors of the patients, threatening their socio-economic health.Subsequently, the social participation of patients with mental illness is disrupted, and they refrain from seeking social assistance.In fact, stigma leads to the rejection of patients with mental illness by the society, disrupting their emotional regulation and making them unable to have proper emotional regulation strategies.Furthermore, the stigma of mental illness causes the patients not to have appropriate coping strategies for the disease, hide their medical history from the medical staff, and avoid communicating with their friends after discharge from the hospital.Given the importance of the concept of stigma, identifying the positively correlated behaviors seems essential.Self-compassion is a positive behavior that may be associated with stigma.Individuals with high self-compassion are more likely to accept negative life events and have more accurate self-assessments and better mental health.Self-compassion is an important factor in the adaptive responses to the mood problems in patients with a history of recurrent depression.High self-compassion reduces the mental vulnerability of patients with mental illness to problems, their depression and social anxiety, shame caused by the illness, and selfcriticism.In contrast, the lack of self-compassion leads to self-judgment, a sense of further isolation, and a rush of negative emotions about oneself, which ultimately lead to the loss of intimacy in the relationships with others.Low self-compassion is present in a wide range of individuals with mental disorders and causes emotional distress, so that individuals with mental illness and low self-compassion are more likely to have suicidal thoughts.The present study aimed to assess the correlation between stigma and self-compassion in patients with the bipolar disorder.Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 200 patients with the bipolar disorder admitted to Iran Psychiatric Center in Tehran, Iran, who were selected via continuous sampling.Data were collected using a demographic data form and stigma and self-compassion tools.The demographic data form included data on age, gender, marital status, number of children, education level, occupation status, family history of mental disorders, number of family members, and number of admissions.The researcher evaluated the validity and reliability of the instruments.To determine validity, the instruments were provided to seven professors of the department of psychiatric nursing at Iran and",

      "abstract": "Among older persons, the prevalence of a depressive disorder is high. Almost half of the depressed patients suffer from significant anxiety symptoms. In clinical practice this combination of depression and anxiety is challenging as high levels of anxiety in depression are associated with more impairment and a worse prognosis. Anxiety in late-life depression has many faces. It can represent itself in a physical or mental form, like tension or worry. With all its complications it can also be categorized as a separate anxiety disorder, like a panic disorder or a generalized anxiety disorder. Many former studies that examined this so-called ‘anxious depression’ did not differentiate between depression with high levels of anxiety and a depression with a concurrent anxiety disorder.Our general message stresses the importance to differentiate between these depressive states. Different characteristics are found, like certain personality traits or the impact of life-events. These characteristics differentiate even further when we look at separate concurrent anxiety disorders. The combination of anxiety and depression shows a less favorable course and has a negative impact on complete remission over a period of two years. In one of the studies, we investigated the feasibility of a method of intensive repeated measurements. The patient reported about her depressive and anxiety symptoms five times a day during her daily activities. This provided a detailed insight in her symptom dynamics and stimulated a dialogue on possible treatment targets and interventions.",

Diagnosis of mania requires that a patient’s work and social life be significantly affected, or that the patient needs hospitalisation.

Consequences of CFS found include social isolation and stigmatization, physical inactivity, psychological disturb ances and a reduced quality of life. Plausible mechanism for the development of CFS is based on loss of immunological tolerance to the vasoactive neuropeptides following infection, significant physical exercise or de novo. Considerable evidence points towards a prominent role for central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CFS. Patients with CFS are described as perfectionist, conscientious, hardworking, somewhat neurotic and introverted individuals with high personal standards, a great desire to be socially accepted and with a history of continuously pushing themselves past their limits. Fewer than 20% of persons with CFS have been diagnosed and treated. Graded exercise therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy appeared to reduce symptoms and improve function based on evidence from RCTs.",

Nevertheless some people, even after a couple of months, do not succeed in integrating this experience in their daily life and remain stuck in a state of suffering condition that seriously extended in the time is functionally impairing. For long time psychology has focused on bereavement subsequent to the loss and the complications that can derive from the missing elaboration. The condition of prolonged grief has been object of a large debate in the past years, up to the individualization of a specific set of symptoms identified in a new diagnostic category: the Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD). The PGD is featured as a condition of emotional distress and physical distress by the loss, not for the death, of a significant only, with daily involvement in all function areas. Our work given a short and non exhaustive overview of the cultural and scientific run that has brought to the collection of the evidences to insert the PGD as new diagnostic category in the DSM V and a comparison between the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) for better underlining similes, but above all differences among categories that subtend clinical conditions that can appear sometimes overlaps.",

Few are specific or unique to psychiatric morbidity during the menopausal transition. Those that may be more prevalent or limiting during this period of life than prior to it include vasomo-tor symptoms, life stressors, and increased physical problems.

      "title": "The development of psychoanalytic explanations of PTSD and assoicated disorders with a special focus on the somatic sequelae to torture",
      "abstract": "PTSD or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (or, earlier, Syndrome) covers a great variety of symptoms which develop in a variety of contexts – accidents, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, wars and other events where people come face to face with violence and death. PTSD was included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-III, during the early 1980s. The symptoms described in the current manual, DSM-IV, under the diagnostic categories of arousal, avoidance and re-experiencing, include symptoms of anxiety, depression, phobic symptoms, irritation, anger, and repetition of trauma in nightmares and daydreams. This thesis sketches out some of the early debates dating back to the end of the nineteenth century as well as more recent ones which developed after the inclusion of the disorder in DSM-III. These debates have been fuelled by political and economic concerns involving governments and insurance companies as well as aetiological concerns regarding the cause of symptoms. More recent debates have involved questions as to whether or not PTSD is a coherent disorder, what factors might affect the development of symptoms and what evidence there is for unusually clear and persistent memories of trauma. Different theoretical schools have often been pitched against each other when putting forward evidence as to the symptoms and cause of PTSD –and this in turn has been used to question whether there is a coherent disorder warranting an inclusion in DSM-IV. The theoretical and empirical work of this thesis, however, has found that the theoretical stances have more in common when considering the causes and manifestations of PTSD than might be suspected. They largely point towards the same causes, such as the involvement of defence systems against danger which malfunction (neuropsychological and Freudian theories) and the development of unusually clear memories which are either ‘over consolidated’ or stored ‘differently’ (neuropsychological theories, psychoanalytic theories and cognitive theories), causing in turn a lack of integration of the experience of trauma into pre-existing memory structures (cognitive theory, neuropsychological theory and psychoanalytic theory). The inclusion or exclusion of specific symptoms not only affects clinical community work but also has a very real effect on individuals and their fate. One key concern here is somatic symptoms and general anxiety, which were considered to be a part of traumatic neurosis in psychoanalytic theory; but these symptoms were excluded from the DSM diagnosis of PTSD. Torture victims suffer a great number of somatic symptoms; some caused by violence, others with no obvious physiological cause. I put forward evidence in Chapter 1 of this thesis that somatic symptoms are co-morbid with PTSD, specifically when considering subjects who have been exposed to high levels of trauma. In the context of the European Union, PTSD is one of the factors which may be considered in applications for asylum. The lack of understanding of somatic symptoms, in terms of their relation to high level exposure to trauma, may lead to the individual being labelled as a hysteric or a hypochondriac, which in certain cases might lead to a ‘questioning’ of the credibility of their testimony, particularly at a moment when political opinion has turned against the acceptance of asylum seekers. This thesis belongs to the genre of critique of the diagnosis of PTSD in its current form. It takes a predominantly psychoanalytic approach and both uses and develops Freudian and Lacanian theory in considering the major diagnostic categories and defining symptoms of PTSD. However it also takes into account neuropsychological and cognitive theories. It addresses some of the core questions raised in the debates mentioned above. It is argued that PTSD is a coherent disorder that should indeed include not only symptoms of re-experiencing (as it does now) but also symptoms of general anxiety and somatic symptoms. My reading of Freud suggests that symptoms of avoidance also should be included, a point on which Lacanian theory is not conclusive. Further, the thesis demonstrates that the suggested inclusion of general anxiety and somatic symptoms is also supported by neuropsychological theories. Another key point is that Freudian and Lacanian theory suggest that preparedness for trauma might be a factor protecting a subject from developing symptoms of PTSD after trauma and, again, supporting evidence can be found in some neuropsychological theories and also in cognitive theories. All accounts converge on the presence of unusually strong and persistent memories. Freudian and Lacanian theories suggest that traumatic neurosis is caused by a confrontation with violent death, as described in DSM-IV. DSM-IV also suggests that PTSD can develop after observing the suffering of others, where violent death, physical damage or the threat of death and physical damage is involved. Lacanian theory presented in this thesis will offer insight into why being threatened by physical damage or observing others being threatened or wounded can lead to PTSD. The theory developed in this thesis implies that, while PTSD is not dependent on underlying structures of neurosis, psychosis and perversion, it is, however, likely that PTSD will affect underlying structures in facilitating the development of particular symptoms.

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder.

      "abstract": "Musculoskeletal injury can cause acute pain and can also trigger chronic pain. The mechanisms resulting in these 2 outcomes are essentially different, with acute pain relating primarily to peripheral nociception and chronic pain relating primarily to central sensitization. Acute musculoskeletal pain usually resolves with time or treatment. Chronic pain, by definition, persists and associates with significant longterm health effects and diminished quality of life (QOL). Despite the importance of this problem, the issues surrounding persisting pain after injury remain controversial1. Aspects of postinjury pain and disability are addressed in this issue of The Journal through followup of persons involved in minor trauma from motor vehicle accidents2. The clinical features of patients with persisting pain after trauma, where the inciting lesion has resolved, are usually distinctive and embody a number of characteristic pain phenotypes. Central sensitization is the most prominent contributing mechanism3. Common examples are fibromyalgia (FM), regional pain syndrome, and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)4. These disorders are characterized by widespread or regionalized pain in a distribution that cannot be explained by an abnormality of a specific localized musculoskeletal or neural structure, be it in the periphery or in the spinal area. The pain may be segmental and often accompanied by unpleasant non-neuroanatomical sensory sensations within the same region. There is widespread or regional lowering of pain threshold elicited clinically by the determination of abnormal tenderness on palpation, more prominent in selected areas known as tender points. Muscular tightness, co-contraction, and development of trigger points are common. There is often mild soft tissue swelling and dermatographia, indicative of neurogenic inflammation. In CRPS more prominent vasomotor, sudomotor, muscle, and dystrophic features are present5. In addition to these physical signs, patients complain to a varying degree about sleep disturbance, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, … Address correspondence to Dr. Littlejohn, Suite H, Monash Medical Centre, 246 Clayton Road, Clayton, Victoria, Australia; E-mail: Geoff.littlejohn{at}monash.edu",

      "title": "The positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia reflect impairments in the perception and initiation of action",
      "abstract": "Synopsis The CNS maintains a fundamental distinction between actions elicited by external stimuli and actions elicited by internal goals (acts of will). As a result the intact organism can monitor centrally three aspects of its own actions: (1) the action appropriate to current external stimulation (stimulus intention or meaning); (2) the action appropriate to current goals (willed intention); and (3) the action which was actually selected (corollary discharge). In Type I (acute) schizophrenic patients, intentions of will lead to actions, but these willed intentions are not monitored correctly. This apparent discrepancy between will and action gives rise to experiential (1st rank) positive symptoms (e.g. delusions of control and passivity). In Type II (chronic) patients, intentions of will are no longer properly formed and so actions are rarely elicited via this route. This gives rise to behavioural negative signs (e.g. poverty of speech). The behaviour of Type II schizophrenics has surface similarities to that shown by patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with frontal lobe lesions in that all three types of patient show a relative deficit of actions elicited by willed intentions. Dopamine blocking drugs reduce positive symptoms in Type I patients precisely because they induce Parkinsonism, i.e. reduce the likelihood of actions being initiated by willed intentions. This in turn reduces the likelihood that actions will occur for which the patient had no awareness of his intention to act.",

      "title": "Overtraining in endurance athletes: a brief review",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is an imbalance between training and recovery, exercise and exercise capacity, stress and stress tolerance. Stress is the sum of training and nontraining stress factors. Peripheral (short-term overtraining, STO) or peripheral and central fatigue may result (long-term overtraining, LTO). STO lasting a few days up to 2 wk is termed overreaching. STO is associated with fatigue, reduction, or stagnation of the 4 LT performance capacity (performance at 4 mmol lactate or comparable criterion), reduction of maximum performance capacity, and brief competitive incompetence. Recovery is achieved within days, so the prognosis is favorable, LTO lasting weeks or months causes overtraining syndrome or staleness. The symptomatology associated with overtraining syndrome has changed over the last 50 yr from excitation and restlessness (so-called sympathetic form) to phlegmatic behavior and inhibition (so-called parasympathetic form). Increased volume of training at a high-intensity level is likely the culprit. The parasympathetic form of overtraining syndrome dominates in endurance sports. Accumulation of exercise and nonexercise fatigue, stagnation, or reduction of the 4 LT performance capacity, reduction in maximum performance capacity, mood state disturbances, muscle soreness/stiffness, and long-term competitive incompetence can be expected. Complete recovery requires weeks and months, so the prognosis is unfavorable. Other optional or further confirmation requiring findings include changes in blood chemistry variables, hormone levels, and nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion. Based on the findings reported, recommendations for training monitoring can be made, but their relevance in the practice must still be clarified.",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic epidemics cover various forms of collective behavior and include mass hysteria, mass psychogenic illness, and hysterical contagion for which no physical explanation can be found. The typical course of a psychogenic epidemic at a workplace progresses from sudden onset, often with dramatic symptoms, to a rapidly attained peak that draws much publicity and is followed by quick disappearance of the symptoms. Over 90% of the affected persons are women, and the symptoms range from dizziness, vomiting, nausea, and fainting to epileptic-type seizures, hyperventilation, and skin disorders. The background mechanisms are thought to be generalized beliefs and triggering events which create a sense of threat that leads to a physiological state of arousal. This state, in turn, creates new beliefs which give meaning to the sense of arousal. The new belief spreads through sociometric channels. Predisposing factors include boredom, pressure to produce, physical stressors, poor labor-management relations, and impaired interpersonal communications, and lack of social support. It is important that a thorough investigation be carried out in all instances. Investigation is not only necessary for diagnosis, but it also reassures the management, the employees, and the press that physical factors are unlikely to be responsible for the disease.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a common complaint experienced by most of subjects during lifetime, which affects approximately 30-50% of general population as point prevalence. 1 According to the fatigue-lasting duration, it is classified as acute (<1 month), prolonged (>1 month, <6 months), and chronic fatigue (≥6 months), respectively.Acute fatigue is generally disappears after taking a rest or treating the causative diseases, while uncontrolled prolonged and chronic fatigue limit the physical and social activities. 2 Especially, medically unexplained chronic fatigue is a debilitating status, such as idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).On the other hand, to distinguish CFS from chronic fatigue or ICF is very important in clinical practice.The reason is that although patients present fatigue symptom as their main complaint in subjects suffering from chronic fatigue or CFS, CFS is considered as to being in totally different pathologic illness. 3In 2015, US Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported diagnostic criteria for CFS as follows; three mandatory symptoms, a substantial impairment in activities accompanied by fatigue persisting for more than 6 months, postexertional malaise (PEM) and unrefreshing sleep, and one optional symptom among cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. 4nlike chronic fatigue, CFS has characteristics of brain and CNS symptom and is counted as a complex, multisystem neuroimmune disease.As commonly referred to myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)/CFS together, brain inflammation is frequently implied in pathology of CFS. 5 Above facts brought a necessity of new name which distinguishes CFS from chronic fatigue, without the word \"fatigue\".IOM therefore recommended \"systemic exertion intolerance",

      "title": "Recovery Versus Remission in Schizophrenia and Related Persistent Psychotic Disorders: no Contrasting but Complementary Models",
      "abstract": "At present there is no consensus on defining “Recovery” in schizophrenia,while there is an accepted definition of “Remission”. Remission model considers “stability” the treatment primary goal and, once achieved, focus is on mainteining stability and preventing relapse. This model reflects a condition where are absent prominent symptoms but may be present some mild symptoms of schizophrenia, retaining not realistic absence of any symptoms. It would require treating an acute psychotic episode,then there still may be a range of no detectable or persistent and disabling symptoms:remission and level of functioning are related but not the same. Some patients could have good level of functioning despite persistent symptoms and others could meet remission criteria despite considerable impairments. Remission is an obteinable outcome for many psychotic outpatients:the point of departure between manteinance and recovery-oriented model happens only after “stability” is achieved;no one could recover in face of repeated crisis,hospitalisation or unrelenting psychotic symptoms. Unfortunately two causes have resulted in a relative neglect of the concept of recovery from psychotic illness:the divide between mainstream biologically oriented psychiatry and the psychiatric rehabilitation movement;the misunderstanding fact that term “recovery movement” is sometimes construed as anti-medication or anti-psychiatry orientation. Irrefuteble point is that recovery model not rejects the importance of remission:stability and relapse prevention. The recovery model besides asserts that achieving remission is the beginning and not the end of treatment plan:then there will be continued efforts to work with patient,family,caregiver,to continue to achieve further improvements in life goals. The “Recovery” patient-centred model have to be embraced as prymary goal by mainstream organizations and services in Mental Health.",

Although their form of clinical presentation may be similar, their evolution and prognosis are very different. It is very important to detect the possible factors of chronicity in order to make an early intervention and thus to diminish the negative consequences of the disease.We conducted a 2 year prospective study in 48 patients diagnosed with acute psychosis in their first admission. Data was collected on the evolution and follow-up of the patient in the Mental Health Unit and the sociodemographic and clinical factors of the psychotic index episode that could predict a change in the diagnosis during the two years follow-up were analyzed.None of the sociodemographic or clinical variables studied could predict a change in the diagnosis, except for the presence of a control delusion during the index episode. The diagnosis of schizophreniform or not otherwise specified psychotic disorders predicts an evolution towards schizophrenia or affective psychosis while a brief or substance-induced psychotic episode has a better prognosis, with a tendency to maintain the same diagnosis in the 2 years of follow-up.After 2 years of follow-up, an significant number of the patients initially diagnosed of acute psychosis evolved towards a diagnosis of schizophrenia or affective psychosis in a difficult-to-predict way.",

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, this notion has been a conspicuous part of the lore of this illness dating back to its earliest clinical descriptions.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Dissociation is a ubiquitous clinical phenomenon. Dissociative disorders (DD) are primarily characterized by dissociation, and dissociative states are also a criterion for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociative reactions such as depersonalization/derealization and amnesia (e.g., gaps in awareness/memory) across diagnostic categories are believed to be affect contingent and theorized to serve affect regulation functions. What is not clear, however, is how self-reported affect and physiological reactivity unfold within dissociative episodes. To address this issue, the present project aims to investigate the hypothesis (1) whether self-reported distress (as indicated by arousal, e.g., feeling tense/agitated, and/or valence, e.g., feeling discontent/unwell) and physiological reactivity increase before dissociative episodes and (2) whether self-reported distress and physiological reactivity decrease during and after dissociative episodes in a transdiagnostic sample of patients with DD, BPD, and/or PTSD. Methods and analyses: We will use a smartphone application to assess affect and dissociation 12 times per day over the course of one week in everyday life. During this time, heart and respiratory rates will be remotely monitored. Afterwards, participants will report affect and dissociative states eight times in the laboratory before, during, and after the Trier Social Stress Test. During the laboratory task, we will continuously record heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory rate, as well as measure blood pressure and take salivary samples to determine cortisol levels. Our hypotheses will be tested using multilevel structural equation models. Power analyses determined a sample size of 85.",

Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person′s family,work or school life and general health. Approximately 3. 4% of the patients with major depression commit suicide. Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa.

Recently developed measurements of stress, specifically the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS), allow a more focused perspective on the differing psychosocial pathways to psychiatric and physical disorder. This is the result of the level of measurement employed by the LEDS, whereby specific qualities of distress, such as losses, dangers, frustrations, and so on, can be distinguished from each other within the overall category of distressing/unpleasant experience. Studies of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, abdominal pain, appendectomy, menorrhagia, secondary amenorrhea, and myocardial infarction using the LEDS suggest that the specific qualities of the stressors involved in the onset of each condition may parallel similar predisposing vulnerabilities in the personalities of those becoming ill, and corresponding psychiatric conditions between stressor and somatic onset. An overall framework is outlined within which disorders are typified as more or less disengaged/overengaged, and suggestions are offered for future research.",

This paper examines the suggestion that mild stimulation or appropriately timed challenges may be used clinically in order to influence the impact of age-related disease and dysfunction. Examples of stimulation or challenges that may exhibit hormetic effects include dietary restriction, physical and mental exercise, and even social and spiritual stimulation. Dietary restriction places the organism under nutritional stress, stimulating several biochemical repair pathways that may counteract certain age-related changes. Physical and mental challenges, if appropriately timed and sufficiently varied, are directed at increasing the complexity and integration of interacting muscular, cardiovascular, and neural stimuli. Social and spiritual stimulation aimed at reversing age-related loss of dynamical complexity acts upon even higher levels to ensure a reduced risk of social problems in aging.",

The diagnosis is to be used when the individual displays prolonged and severe manifestations of the following listed criteria: The basic feature which is always present in this personality disorder is: 1. Intense and extensive power strivings. In addition, at least three other of the following characteristics should be present; 2.

Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "There are several other problems that are frequently associated with the diagnosis of PTSD. These include acute stress disorder (ASD), feelings of depression and guilt, and other anxiety reactions, such as panic attacks. The essential features of ASD are similar to those of PTSD. ASD can be diagnosed if a person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which the person experiences feelings of dissociation, reexperiences symptoms, shows marked avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, and experiences hyperarousal. For the diagnosis of ASD to be given, the distress must be present for a minimum of two days and a maximum of four weeks and must occur within four weeks of the traumatic event. Other common reactions to extreme stressors include physical complaints, such as chronic pain, fatigue, stomach pains, breathing problems, and headaches, and self-destructive or impulsive behavior, such as alcohol or drug abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, suicidal impulses, and fast or reckless driving.",

      "abstract": "Somatization implies a tendency to experience and communicate psychological distress in the form of somatic symptoms and to seek medical help for them. So defined, it is neither a disorder nor a diagnostic category but a generic term for a set of experiential, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics of patients who complain of physical symptoms in the absence of relevant medical findings. Such patients are ubiquitous in all medical care settings, pose difficult diagnostic and management problems, and overutilize health care thus contributing to its cost. Somatization may be transient or persistent, and may or may not be associated with a diagnosable medical or psychiatric disorder. The most common concurrence of somatization is with affective and anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser degree, the somatoform disorders. Persistent somatization poses a serious clinical, social, and economic problem and hence early identification of potential chronic somatizers should be attempted to avoid its development. Pain, fatigue, dizziness, and dyspnea are the commonest symptoms. Etiology of somatization is multifactorial and so should be its management.",

      "abstract": "Summary Overtraining, a decrease in performance despite training that does not disappear after 2 weeks of relative rest, accompanied by symptoms like fatigue, anorexia, and muscle and joint pain, mood changes and feeling burnt out or stale is a frequent syndrome in endurance athletes. It is generally the result of excessive activity from training and competition in combination with insufficient rest. It can be exacerbated and/or triggered by other stresses. Excluding other illnesses its diagnosis is made on history and serial exercise test data, no simple discriminative laboratory tests exist yet. Treatment is rest and gradual reintroduction of training. Prevention is possible and can be done by carefully monitoring subjective exertion from training and general mood combined with simple exercise test results. Its aetiology is not well known. The cytokine model of excessive stress leading to a generalized inflammatory state may explain the overtraining syndrome and represents an interesting avenue of further research to improve the diagnosis and management of this frequent and debilitating health problem in athletes.",

[3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

This is particularly true for the subset of people who are intrinsically more vulnerable to stressful conditions. Yet the underlying mechanisms for such developmental trajectory from early life insult to aberrant adult behavior remains elusive. Adolescence is a period of dynamic physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes, encompassing a distinct neurodevelopmental stage called the 'critical period'. During adolescence, the brain is uniquely susceptible to stress. Stress mediators may lead to disturbances to biological processes that can cause permanent alterations in the adult stage, even as severe as the onset of mental illness when paired with genetic risk and environmental factors. Understanding the molecular factors governing the critical period and how stress can disturb the maturation processes will allow for better treatment and prevention of late adolescent/young adult onset psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Application of the PRECEDE Model to Understanding Postnatal Depression.",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Fourth Edition (SM-IV-TR) postnatal depression (PND) is not currently recognized as a separate diagnosis. Instead, the DSM-IV-TR recognizes mood problems during the postnatal period using a postnatal onset specifier to several mood disorders including, major depressive, manic or mixed episode of major depressive disorder, bipolar i disorder, bipolar ii disorder and brief psychotic disorder (1).Postnatal depression, that is depression occurs in a mother within 6 weeks of her giving birth, can have profound effects upon the health and wellbeing of the mother, her baby and the family (2) characterized by a number of symptoms including core symptoms of depressed mood and/or loss of pleasure, together with additional symptoms, including changes in weight or sleep, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worth lessens or guiltiness, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation (3). Therefore, PND is a multifactorial disorder with biological, psychological, and sociological aspects interacting with woman's risk individually. In addition to the considerable negative personal impact that PND has on women, PND also negatively affects marital relationships (1). Mothers are fully active in their role, when they feel healthy, and the society considers them healthy. While, PND can be explained by clinical criteria and physical symptoms, social recognition is also effective in this area.PND may also detrimentally affect mother-infant attachment, and infant social and cognitive development. Depressed mothers are less emotionally sensitive and less attuned to their infant's emotional state. These serious implications make PND an important mental illness to study because of the tremendous impact it has on the mother and support system, including child's development and familial relationships (1). The ability of a woman to adjust to these changes affects herself, her infant, other children she may have, and her partner (3). Healthy People 2010 listed improve-ement of the health and well-being of women, infants, children, and families as goal (3).The first step in designing an educational program is selecting a health education model which starts the program on the right way and guides it to the evaluation phase. One of the frequently used models in health education and promotion is the PRECEDE model. We assessed the effectiveness of application of PRECEDE model on pregnant women for preventing PND. We hypothesized that predisposing, enabling and reinforcing would serve as antecedents to postnatal depression. Identifying preventive factors is considered an important step in treatment of PND. Predisposing factors, enabling and reinforcing factors are presented as underlying factors in PRECEDE model and addressing each of these factors by the individual and society plays an important role in prevention of this disorder.Therefore, this study investigated predisposing, enabling and reinforcing as factors that can prevent postnatal depression.The PRECEDE model has been widely applied in health promotion settings. Its main goals are to explain health-related behaviors and to guide the design of interventions that aim to change healthrelated behaviors, their antecedents, and their sequelae (4). The PRECEDE framework attempts to identify a type of education which results in certain changes and eventually leads to Prevented PND. The PRECEDE portion of the model (Phases 1-4) includes social, epidemiological, behavioral, environmental, educational, adminis-trative, and policy assessments. Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling, Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) model has been developed by Green and Kreuter as a theoretical model to identify the needs of educational programs and health promotion (5). …",

The extent of the emotional blood pressure response depends upon the natural emotional reactivity of the animal and the degree of training, being most pronounced in highly trained animals. These factors must be considered in experiments on trained dogs when it is important to avoid emotional tension. It is possible that frequent daily repetitions of these emotional states may over a period of months or years lead to morphological changes in the kidneys and cardiovascular system with persistent elevation of blood pressure. It is reasonable to assume that the high degree of restraint and conditioning which are characteristic of the daily existence of the average human subject may eventually result in a similar state of irritability of the vasomotor centers so that minor changes in the daily routine or environment may lead to repeated and excessive acute blood pressure elevations and over a period of years become a factor in the genesis of certain types of hypertension.",

Somatic symptoms of the syndrome have been subject of an extensive body of literature. In comparison, psychiatric aspects have caught relatively less attention. Psychiatric aspects of etiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic concepts are essential for evaluation of the syndrome. Application of CDC-criteria to a well known disease does not solve the nosological problem, but may define the syndrome more accurately. In this respect, issues including psychiatric comorbidity and specificity of neuropathological symptoms are discussed. Psychological variables seem to have a high predictor value for time course and outcome of the symptoms. Etiological concepts emphasize on biological or psychosocial factors. Alterations of biological parameters including immune functions, sleep regulation, and hypothalamic-pituary-adrenocortical function have been reported. The role of cultural factors has been discussed extensively. Somatic and psychological stress may result in the same clinical syndrome via psychoimmunological mechanisms. An integrated, interdisciplinary approach to further refine diagnostic criteria, understanding of etiology and development of adequate therapeutic measures seems necessary.",

      "title": "Post‐stroke depression and apathy: Interactions between functional recovery, lesion location, and emotional response",
      "abstract": "Abstract Depression and apathy are often observed after stroke and are often confused with one another. In the present review, we argue that the current concept of ‘post‐stroke depression’ (PSD) in fact consists of two core symptoms or syndromes: (i) affective (depressive) PSD; and (ii) apathetic PSD. We argue that these two core symptoms are each associated with a different underlying neuroanatomical mechanism, a pattern that influences functional recovery. Post‐stroke disabilities can provoke several distinct emotional responses, some of which are associated with severe depression. We examined one of these emotional responses previously, namely ‘insistence on recovery’, which was believed to be a negative indicator of functional improvement in disabled stroke patients. However, an appropriate level of insistence on recovery may, in fact, be associated with reduced depression and apathy, resulting in enhanced recovery from stroke‐related disabilities. Improvements in physical disabilities (trunk stability or activities of daily living, such as walking) also reduce depression and apathy. Therefore, the experience of PSD/apathy may be intertwined with various initial emotional responses and improvements in physical functioning. Effective treatment of PSD/apathy requires a multidisciplinary approach, such that neuroanatomical/neurobiological, emotional, and physical (rehabilitation) domains are all addressed.",

Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas.

Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

      "title": "Measurement and assessment of somatic symptoms",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptoms are common presentations in health settings. They can manifest as symptoms of another underlying mental disorder or be termed as medically unexplained. When they are medically unexplained they are invariably subsumed under the diagnostic categories of somatoform disorders. They are associated with interference in functioning, poor quality of life and are burdensome on health resources. The measurement of these symptoms is essential for understanding the individual and planning treatment. There are various instruments that have somatic symptoms measurement in their items. The tools have included somatic symptoms measurement in measuring general psychopathology, somatic symptoms as part of anxiety and depression, somatic symptoms specifically, and as a screening instrument for somatoform disorders. The advantages and disadvantages of common measures have been discussed. It appears that no one measure fulfils the essential criteria of an ideal measure for somatic symptoms. The measures of somatic symptoms should also be culturally sensitive and serve diagnostic, prognostic and heuristic purposes. These aspects are highlighted in the review.",

In a vulnerable adolescent, a stressful developmental event may trigger a pathological response--acute anxiety, depression with or without suicidal ideation or behavior, severe conduct disturbance, a first psychotic episode, or explosive or violent behavior--that requires emergency psychiatric treatment. The basic components of an emergency psychiatric evaluation of an adolescent include initial observation of the patient, taking a history, interviewing the patient and others accompanying the patient, conducting a mental status examination, making a diagnosis, and planning for disposition and further treatment. Such an evaluation may be the first contact with the mental health system for many adolescents, and the intervention of a sensitive clinician may help the adolescent be more comfortable seeking mental health care in the future.",

However, abnormal non-verbal expression, but not schizoid personality traits or DSM-III schizotypal personality disorder, was particularly likely to occur in those subjects who had evidence of neurological deficit, and childhood symptoms indicative of developmental disorder. Abnormal non-verbal expression, but not personality disorder, was also associated with other characteristic features of Asperger's syndrome, such as unusual, 'special' interests. It is suggested that Asperger's syndrome is a distinct syndrome from either schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder, but may be a risk factor for the development of schizoid personality disorder.",

The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs.

Such factors include, but are not limited to, female gender, social disadvantage, childhood adver sity, genetic predisposition, and substance abuse. PTSD has a high rate of comorbidity with psychiatric, substance abuse, and somatization disorders. Persons with PTSD experience profound and persistent alterations in their physiological reactivity to internal and external stimuli which prevents them from utilizing their emotions to process incoming information. These patients have chronically high levels of sympathetic nervous system activity and low levels of glucocorticoids to cope with stress and modulate their catecholamine levels. Neuropsychological assessment of patients with PTSD depends to a large degree on the sensitivity of the measures which are utilized and a pre-existing history of learning disabilities, head trauma, and/or neurological disorders. While closed head injuries (CHI) are unlikely to produce PTSD symptoms, persons with CHI are likely to develop PTSD symptoms if they are exposed to trauma prior to the onset of retrograde amnesia or after the resolution of post-traumatic amnesia. If the traumatic event occurs while the patient with CHI is amnestic or unconscious, they are unlikely to develop PTSD symptoms. The liberal criteria used to diagnose mild CHI is likely to result in patients with acute stress disorders being misdiagnosed with CHI as a result of their dissociative symptoms which reduce their awareness and encoding of the traumatic event.",

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

      "title": "The promise of social recovery therapy in non‐affective psychoses",
      "abstract": "Non-affective psychoses (schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorders) are the health conditions of working age adults most frequently associated with poor social outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies suggest that less than 50% of people with these conditions achieve social recovery, less than 15% achieve sustained recovery in both symptomatic and social domains, and only 10-20% of people return to competitive employment, despite the majority reporting that they wish to work1. Social recovery therapy (SRT) is a psychosocial treatment to promote social recovery in people with non-affective psychosis who are socially withdrawn, have complex and comorbid problems, and are unresponsive to existing interventions. It is based on a model in which social disability evolves as a result of lifestyle patterns of low activity, adopted to achieve behavioral avoidance, and maintained by lack of hope, agency and motivation. Social disability in psychosis typically occurs in the context of persistent positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, often accompanied by depression, anxiety and other psychopathological manifestations. Alongside such issues are complex social circumstances and systemic issues, including problematic family dynamics, victimization, social threat and social deprivation. In the face of such problems, individuals adopt lifestyle patterns of extreme social withdrawal, leaving work or education and losing contact with social networks. SRT is described in a manual2 and delivered individually across 9 months. Sessions take place in participants' homes and community locations. Interim telephone and email contact usually occurs. SRT delivery is structured in three stages. Stage 1 includes assessment and development of a shared social recovery formulation. Stage 2 involves identifying and working towards medium- to long-term goals guided by a systemic formulation of barriers to recovery, with a focus on promoting a sense of agency, hope and motivation, and encouraging activity while managing psychotic symptoms. Stage 3 involves the active promotion of structured activity linked to meaningful goals, while still managing symptoms. The focus of the intervention is on the individual's personal values and goals, identifying problems and barriers to these, then promoting hope for meaningful behavioral change and activity toward these goals. There is a strong emphasis on the use of behavioral strategies (including behavioral experiments, graded exposure and behavioral activation) to overcome avoidance and promote meaningful lifestyle change in vivo whilst managing symptoms as necessary to implement a concrete pathway to social recovery. Evidence and experiences from this behavioral work are used to further instill hope and promote positive beliefs about self as the individual works towards achieving meaningful change in his/her life. As SRT aims to engage people with psychosis into structured activity, it often includes supporting them to access employment, education, training, voluntary and/or leisure opportunities. Much of SRT takes place in community settings. It is often useful for the therapist to drive the client to new locations and settings or accompany him/her on public transport. To achieve gains in social recovery against a background of often years of withdrawal and social disadvantage means that therapists have to integrate techniques typically associated with assertive community treatment and supported employment. Working systemically with families and stakeholders surrounding the individual to promote opportunities in the social environment is also important. Behavioral activation and behavioral experiments are conducted in line with the client's identified goals and values and at a pace respecting the nature of the difficulties faced. The therapist works alongside the client to aid motivation and engagement in identified activities that can be incorporated into daily life, and work out collaborative strategies to manage ongoing symptoms in vivo. To date, we have conducted two assessor-blind randomized controlled trials of SRT in people with psychosis with severe social disability. In the Improving Social Recovery in Early Psychosis (ISREP) trial3, 77 participants with affective or non-affective psychosis presenting social withdrawal were randomized to receive either SRT plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone. TAU consisted of case management from a secondary mental health care team. In the non-affective psychosis group, SRT showed a significant and clinically beneficial effect on the primary outcome of weekly hours in structured activity, as well as on positive and negative symptoms. There was also an effect of SRT on hopelessness and positive beliefs about self, with improvements on these variables being a mediator of the change in structured activity. The intervention was also cost-effective4. SUPEREDEN35 was a larger (N=154) phase 2 trial aimed to enhance social recovery in patients who had not responded to early intervention service (EIS) treatment, by combining standard EIS provision with SRT. The primary analysis indicated that the SRT plus EIS was associated with an average increase in structured activity over 8 hours per week greater than EIS alone (95% CI: 2.5-13.6; p=0.005). The size of the effect represents an amount of activity equivalent to a full working day. There is evidence from both the above trials that the gain from SRT may be maintained 6 months beyond active treatment. In a further separate longer-term follow-up study on the ISREP group6, none of the 24 cases in the TAU group had engaged in paid employment in the year following the end of the intervention period, compared with 5 out of 20 (25%) cases in the SRT+TAU group. SRT offers most promise in promoting social recovery in complex cases of non-affective psychoses in which there is little evidence of response to other interventions. Although the results from the two available randomized controlled trials are positive, further large scale pragmatic studies are needed, possibly being expanded to more chronic cases. There may also be promise in combining SRT approaches with other psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive remediation therapy7. We designed SRT so that it can be delivered in task-sharing formats by a less costly and more widely available workforce than that involved in the above trials. We have now developed extensive training materials, including videos as well as adherence and supervision guidance, which we have collated on a website8. Through this and related work, we have found that it is possible to train \"non-expert therapists\" in key elements of the SRT approach, which can then be successfully implemented following the manual. What is needed in the future is to build on the promise of the existing trials of SRT toward further research and implementation involving non-expert therapists and extending into wider populations of people with non-affective psychosis in the community.",

      "title": "Stress and burnout in intensive care medicine: Looking after yourself",
      "abstract": "The term 'burnout' describes the collection of symptoms and signs, both physical and psychological, experienced by individuals due to their work. Individuals often feel a sense of emotional exhaustion, indifference, depersonalisation and a lack of desire for personal achievement. Intensive care medicine is well recognised to place high demands (physical and emotional) and considerable levels of stress on practitioners. It is therefore unsurprising that the incidence of burnout and self-harm/suicide is high. The clinical symptoms and signs of burnout are often non-specific and can include depression, irritability, insomnia, tiredness and anger. The hallmark of burnout is the triad of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and sense of low personal accomplishment. The tool most widely used to diagnose burnout is the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI); this questionnaire consists of 22 items where the responders are asked to indicate the frequency at which they experience certain feelings with regard to their work.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain as a Hypothetical Construct: A Practical and Philosophical Consideration",
      "abstract": "Pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\" Chronic pain is usually described as pain that has persisted for 3-6 months and/or beyond the expected time of healing. The numerical pain rating (NPR) is the customary metric and often considered as a proxy for the subjective experience of chronic pain. This definition of pain (chronic) has been of significant heuristic value. However, the definition and the models it has spawned tend to encourage the interpretation of pain as a measurable entity and implies that the patient's experience of pain can be fully comprehended by someone other than the person in pain. Several major models of pain have been scrutinized and found to propagate the notion of pain as a 'thing' and fall prey to biomedical reductionism and Cartesian (mind-body) dualism. Furthermore, the NPR does not appear to capture the complexity of chronic pain and correlates poorly with other clinically meaningful outcomes. It, and other aspects of the current notion of chronic pain, appear to be an extension of our reliance on the philosophical principles of reductionism and materialism. These and other shortcomings identified in the IASP definition have resulted in an increased interest in a reexamination and possible updating of our view of pain (chronic) and its definition. The present paper describes an alternative view of pain, in particular chronic pain. It argues that chronic pain should be understood as a separate phenomenon from, rather than an extension of, acute pain and interpreted as a hypothetical construct (HC). HCs are contrasted to intervening variables (IV) and the use of HCs in science is illustrated. The acceptance of the principles of nonlinearity and emergence are seen as important characteristics. The practical implications and barriers of this philosophical shift for assessment, treatment, and education are explored. The patient's narrative is presented as a potential source of important phenomenological data relating to their 'experience' of pain. It is further proposed that educational and academic endeavors incorporate a discussion of the process of chronification and the role of complexity theory.",

Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as severity, a high rate of recurrence, psychomotor changes, dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression. The treatment of psychotic mood disorders, regardless of coexisting conditions, requires pharmacotherapy--usually a combination of an antipsychotic drug and a medication for mood--or electroconvulsive therapy.

Social isolation is strongly associated with depressive symptoms, underlying a significant proportion of depressed mood and accounting for the excess of depression seen in widowhood. Though there is a lack of evidence-based interventions for social isolation, one approach may involve one-on-one befriending protocols in which volunteers make phone calls or in-person visits to socially isolated older adults.

Esta se relaciona con una pobre respuesta al tratamiento y pero pronostico funcional. Es necesario identificar los mecanismos biologicos y psicologicos que subyacen en el desarrollo y persistencia delos trastornos emocionales tras un ictus; como la historia psiquiatrica previa, la localizacion y tipo de lesion, el tiempo desde el ictus, el grado de incapacidad fisica y cognitiva acompanante. Los estudios cientificos acerca del procesamiento emocional en estos pacientes se encuentran en su primera etapa.\nMETODO\n Estudio longitudinal, observacional. Inclusion: Pacientes (40-90 anos) con IC menor 10 dias de evolucion. Exclusion: AIT o ictus hemorragico; depresion previa; demencia, analfabetismo, deficit sensorial o afasia: GCS menor 14. Evaluaciones: ingreso, 3 meses, 6 meses y 12 meses. Escalas: Barthel, Canadiense, Rankin modificada, MEC; Test del Informador, Blessed, Hamilton, Post-Stroke Depression Rating Scale, Afecto negativo, 3 expresiones emocionales. Analisis estadistico; descriptivo (Frecuencias, porcentajes) y comparativo (X2, t-student, U de Mann-Whtiney, regresion multiple).\nRESULTADOS\n 56 pacientes (IC derecho 53,57%; IC izquierdo 44,64%). Hubo diferencias entre los grupos al ingreso en las escalas Canadiense (U=191,000; p=0,004), Barthel (U=201,000; p=0,003), Ranking (U= 191,000; p=0,004), Hamilton (U=211,000; (p=0,033) e indice de ansiedad (U=308,000; p=0,049).

The causes of chronic pain are often difficult to discern, as many cases are not associated with physical damage. A predictive processing (PP) perspective proposes that chronic pain results from the brain's erroneous predictions derived from strong emotional and/or fearful reactions to pain. Individuals with anxiety disorders are more likely to react with fear to general stimuli, and therefore may be more likely to develop chronic pain under this model. The current healthcare model for this condition, which focuses on treating symptoms with pain-killers, displays limited efficacy at reducing pain and disability. Conversely, treatment modalities that account for the PP perspective, such as Pain Neuroscience Education, are successful at reducing both pain and disability in chronic pain sufferers. Treatment methods that account for PP's impact in the development of chronic pain conditions should therefore be prioritized in the mainstream healthcare system.",

The etiology of stress-induced illness is multi-faceted but six important components and six relevant symptoms can be derived from the alphabetical constitution of word itself. In the acute stress situation these changes rapidly revert to normal with cessation of challenge, but with long continued stress, they may become perpetuated and result in adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. An increasing awareness of the role that stress may play in the etiology of sustained hypertension might well lead to a better control of stress factors in the patient's life.

      "abstract": "In the 21st century, stress has emerged as a major epidemic, impacting various sectors. The current methods to assess stress and related mental health issues are still mostly based on self-reporting questionnaires, which are time-consuming, prone to bias, do not allow for continuous monitoring, and are not scalable. This results in mental health issues being diagnosed only after the symptoms are severe enough to be noticed by others. Poor mental health is linked to a prolonged state of negative emotions. The significance of these conditions has led researchers to explore the use of emotion recognition systems to assess mental health issues. This chapter offers a look at the state of the art surrounding emotion, encompassing its definition, fundamental theories, and various measurement methodologies. Our review aims to elucidate how emotion recognition technologies can be achieved, towards enhancing mental health interventions. Poor mental health not only diminishes the well-being of individuals but also elevates the risk of errors and accidents, thereby compromising operational effectiveness.",

The influence on immune functioning is more likely lateralized with left cerebral involvement than right-sided involvement. Depression, along with the accompanying neuroimmune changes, is found more frequently after left cerebral lesions than after right-sided lesions. Stress, particularly uncontrollable stress, produces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) dysfunction as measured by elevations in plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone. These changes parallel those seen in many depressed patients. But caution is called for in assessing stress and depression. In everyday life, as opposed to the laboratory, the controllable versus uncontrollable paradigm is not as useful. Attitudes, spiritual resources, hopes, and ideals can neutralize the effects of an uncontrollable stress situation, such as prisoners of war and victims of religious or ethnic persecution might experience. Whether subjective differences in tolerance for such uncontrollable stresses are accompanied by distinguishing indicators of neuroimmune dysfunction has yet to be demonstrated.",

The prevalence of depressive mood states in survivors varies by measure and follow-up time, but the median prevalence across &gt;30 studies was 28% (mostly measured within a year of critical illness). Severe depressive states (e.g. major depressive episodes) are less common than minor depressive states. Risk factors include female sex, lesser educational attainment, unemployment, and medical and psychiatric comorbidity. Potential critical illness/intensive care-related risk factors include severity of organ failure, high-dose benzodiazepine administration, longer ICU stays, stressful ICU experiences, and early post-intensive care distress. Depressive symptoms in survivors are associated with impaired physical function, other psychiatric morbidity, cognitive and work difficulties, and lower health-related quality of life.

      "abstract": "Objective. Factors of the environment, society, as well as internal personal psychological factors and personal experience, affect the formation of mental disorders. Society and stressors determine which behavioral scenarios of the individual will be relevant. Personality characteristics through behavioral responses determine which of the many potential stressors are significant and what impact they will have on the individual.\r\nModern understanding of the genesis of PTSD shows that the individual's overcoming of traumatic stressors of the combat situation depends on three groups of factors: the nature of traumatic events, individual psychological characteristics of veterans, and the conditions in which the demobilized falls after returning from war. The interaction of these factors with the process of cognitive processing of psycho-traumatic experience leads to an increase in mental stress or to the gradual assimilation of psycho-traumatic experience. As a result, it is possible to expect mental restabilization or the emergence of PTSD. The presence of additional bio-psycho-social stressors (e.g., substance abuse, family instability, concomitant medical comorbidity) significantly increases the likelihood of developing PTSD in veterans and the degree of social maladaptation in PTSD. The comorbidity of PTSD and TBI further increases the likelihood of social maladaptation in demobilized servicemen.\r\nThe relevance of studying the impact of life problems on social adaptation in veterans with PTSD and TBI is determined by the need to develop an adequate set of medical and psychological interventions and socio-psychological rehabilitation.Purpose: to investigate medical and anamnestic features and to conduct a modal analysis of life problems of veterans with PTSD and mTBI.\r\nMethods and materials. 329 combatants (members of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, and volunteer battalions) in eastern Ukraine who suffered from PTSD and mTBI were examined.The socio-demographic and medical-anamnestic examination was performed using the Unified map of patient research developed by us. Modal analysis of existing problems was carried out on the basis of ICD-10, their presence was assessed by diagnostic headings: Z55 - Z73.\r\nResults. Antisocial traits and increased social conflict in veterans with PTSD and mTBI correlated with marital/sexual and parental problems, as well as insufficient family support, problematic alcohol/drug use, and inadequate social skills. and conflicting perceptions of their own social status.\r\nConclusions. The negative factors influencing the course of PTSD and mTBI identified by us became the material for the formation of targets of psychosocial therapy and optimization of pharmacological treatment.",

      "title": "Late-life depression",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression is highly heterogeneous in clinical presentation, and is also commonly resistant to treatment. While some cases are a continuation of the chronic course of illness beginning in early adulthood, a large number of persons will have a first episode of depression in later life following alife-time of relatively good mental health. While incident cases of major depression tend to decrease with age, the number of persons with clinically significant depressive symptomatology rises. À distinction has often been made between early-onset and late-onset depression, however, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest these are distinct clinical entities. On the other hand observations from a fifteen year prospective population study of psychiatric disorder in the elderly (the ESPRIT Study) supports the alternative idea that depression may be divided into sub-types according to postulated aetiology; for example depression with a strong genetic component, related to hormonal changes, the consequence of trauma; the result of cerebrovascular insult. Exposure to these putative causes may be more common at different points in the life span, thus suggesting age-differences. Our research further suggests that even cases of depression appearing for the first time in late-life, may be initially triggered by risk factors occurring decades before. Our findings suggest, for example, that childhood events may lead to changes in the biology of stress management, which continue throughout life, increasing vulnerability to depression and persisting even after effective treatment of symptoms. Together these observations suggest it may be more meaningful to classify depression in the elderly according to probable principle precipitating factors rather than age.",

      "title": "Understanding stress: characteristics and caveats.",
      "abstract": "Exposure to stressful situations is among the most common human experiences. These types of situations can range from unexpected calamities to routine daily annoyances. In response to stressors, a series of behavioral, neurochemical, and immunological changes occur that ought to serve in an adaptive capacity. However, if those systems become overly taxed, the organism may become vulnerable to pathology. Likewise, the biological changes, if sufficiently sustained, may themselves adversely affect the organism's well-being. Several factors may dictate an individual's response to environmental stressors, including characteristics of the stressor (i.e., type of stressor and its controllability, predictability, and chronicity); biological factors (i.e., age, gender, and genetics); and the subject's previous stressor history and early life experiences. Research on the physiological and psychological responses to different types of stressful stimuli is presented, focusing particularly on processes that may be relevant to the development of alcohol use disorders. Stressful events may profoundly influence the use of alcohol or other drugs (AODs). For example, the resumption of AOD use after a lengthy period of abstinence may reflect a person's attempt to self-medicate to attenuate the adverse psychological consequences of stressors (e.g., anxiety). Alternatively, stress may increase the reinforcing effects of AODs.",

Psychic (mental) addiction is characterized by feeling of satisfaction and will for drug re-consummation to cause comfort and avoid discomfort.

Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only).

      "title": "Using ’White Flags’ to categorize socio-cultural aspects in chronic pain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Issue Persistent chronic pain is a major medical and health economic problem. To assess the individual pain situation, the classification of various factors (flags) has been established. Description of the problem Structural biomechanical factors are classified as “red flags”. Psychological or behavioral factors are summarized as “yellow flags”, psychiatric and mental illness as “orange flags”. Both last flags are important for planning adequate therapies or rehabilitation, as well as for decisions to prognoses and tailored reintegration programs. An extension of the flag model was achieved by naming personal factors at workplace as “blue flags”, and “black flags”, if there is a restriction for returning to work. All these groups do not consider other important reasons for unsuccessful rehabilitation or failed reintegration. Results In these cases, often described as ’therapy-refractory’, clients often exhibit a special subjective understanding of illness that reacts neither to psychological interventions nor to behavioral therapies. These include individual beliefs based, for example, on cultural socialization, religious education, or spiritual experiences. Since such individual mental illnesses are culturally ideologically or religiously justified, they should be classified in a separate group called ’white flags’. Lessons The advantages of categorizing sociocultural aspects separately from other flag classifications are avoidance of unnecessary therapies, including surgery,prevention of iatrogenisation,prevention of legal disputes. It is important to realize that only health restrictions for insurance benefits can be taken into account and that individual socio-cultural circumstances or health convictions are not evaluated. Main messages: A classification of ’white flags’ could contribute to a better classification of pain which are not accessible to various therapies and reduce reservations and misunderstandings by intercultural communication approaches. Key messages For medical professions it is important to recognize, that only health inabilities are taken into account for insurance compensation and not individual socio-cultural circumstances or health beliefs. In Future classifying ’white flags’ could help to properly assess persistent pain conditions.",

In particular, the anticipation of high demands or effort the next day seems important. Sleep recordings show that stress is associated with shortened sleep, fragmentation, and possibly a reduction in sleep stages 3 and 4. Shortened or disturbed sleep causes increases in levels of traditional stress markers (eg, cortisol) and may thus exacerbate the effects of stress. Much knowledge is still lacking, however, particularly about the effects of real-life work stress. The latter requires longitudinal studies in real-life situations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sixty patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were interviewed about the onset of their illness, and the factors which they felt had contributed to that onset. Common themes in these qualitative data were episodes of infection, “doing too much” and stressful circumstances; in two-thirds of cases, accounts encompassed physical, behavioural and psychological factors. Patients described a gradual, sharp or phased onset, the latter involving a sharp onset but with a short term lifting of symptoms before worsening into chronic illness. A gradual onset was associated with longer duration of illness. Particular themes played a different role in patients' accounts, depending upon onset pattern. With a sharp or phased onset the most common perceived bigger for the abrupt change in health status was an episode of infection, but preceding factors were often invoked to explain the effect that this had had. With a phased onset, subsequent compounding factors (typically overdoing things) were similarly cited to explain worsening and the long term effect of the trigger. Thus, patients provided complex and dynamic accounts of illness onset, incorporating interacting factors. Key Words: Chronic fatigue syndromeonsetattributions",

Depressive illness is the most common associated psychiatric disorder that is found in patients with chronic pain. The three most typical symptoms of a depressive illness are: depressed mood; loss of interest and pleasure; and loss of energy and increased fatigue. Anxiety disorders have been found to be correlated more closely than depression with chronic painful conditions in a large US sample of chronic pain patients. Panic disorder comprises severe unpredictable anxiety episodes that can occur \"out of the blue,\" although they are usually more common in one situation than another. The difficulty for the nonpsychiatric physician in examining a patient with long-standing pain is in differentiating distress from illness.",

Stress may also take the form of personal insult if dentists are regarded as incompetent when compared with their peers, or are seen as insensitive, inconsiderate and inferior to doctors. Attempting to stay on schedule in a busy dental practiceis a chronic source of stress. Not receiving commensurate payment for their services, anxiety about the future and long working hours may also act as stressors. Stress is not good for health! It is well known that stress and poor stress management increase susceptibility and vulnerability to ill health including cardiovascular disease, ulcers, colitis, hypertension, lower back pain, eye strain, maritaldis harmony, alcoholism, drug addiction, mental depression and even suicide. How does stress manifest in the practice? It may result in absenteeism, increased incident rate, inter-personal aggression, poor quality control, low productivity, high aggression, low productivity, high turnover, reduced morale, complaints and litigation.",

      "title": "Burnout, Compassion Fatigue and Vicarious Trauma",
      "abstract": "Compassion Fatigue (CF) in healthcare workers was first coined by Carla Joinson in 1992, in almost three decades following copious amounts of research have been done on this subject. Findings of the research indicate an astronomical growing problem, yet very little has been done to curb this problem. Today researchers agree that one of the major causes of compassion fatigue in nursing is a lack of education. Nurse’s education doesn’t include subjects dealing with self-care, burnout, vicarious trauma, and CF. Francoise Mathieu, an expert on CF, notes that after completing her degree and several courses in three different countries, she had not once heard the words self\u0002care, burnout, and CF, and nor did I until it happened to me “Burnout is a depletion or exhaustion of a person’s mental and physical resources attributed to his or her prolonged yet unsuccessful striving toward unrealistic expectations, internally or externally derived” Burnout is not trauma related and could happen to anyone in all walks of life Vicarious Trauma (VT), also known as Secondary Traumatic Stress, describes a serious shift in the worker’s worldview. VT happens when the trauma and suffering of others are transferred onto us in such a way that we are also traumatized even though we did not experience the trauma ourselves. “VT is the accumulative process: we are not referring to the most difficult story you have ever heard; we are talking about the thousands of stories you don’t even remember hearing” CF is the deep emotional and physical erosion that occurs when helping professionals are unable to refuel and regenerate. “First, you should understand that it’s a process. It’s not a matter of one day, you’re living your life with a great deal of energy and enjoyment, and the next, you wake up exhausted and devoid of any energy-both physical and emotional. Compassion fatigue develops over time-taking weeks, sometimes years to surface. It’s a low\u0002level, chronic clouding of caring and concern for others in your life whether you work in or outside the home. Compassion Fatigue and COVID-19 The C19 Pandemic has highlighted the importance of nurses, something that has always been true but has gone unappreciated for centuries. In doing research for this article I am again amazed at the amount of research that has been done to date on the effect of C19 on nurses, if all we are doing is research, we are missing the point! Another aspect of the research that I found incredible, is that most of the research done focuses on ICU nurses even though a study was done at a hospital in Wuhan comparing the frequency of burnout amongst frontline workers, clearly indicate that burnout frequency amongst ward nurses are significantly higher than ICU nurses, 39% versus 13% [2]. This was a small study of 220 frontline workers but the fact that the burnout frequency is 300% higher inward nurses should command our attention. Watching C19 related news coverage I have been struck by the lack of coverage of nursing fatalities. Physician’s deaths were headline news, interviews with family and colleagues, and then as an afterthought, oh yes, X number of nurses died. Nurse’s deaths where/are rarely a focus on the news and many nurses have taken to social media in an attempt to bring attention to the problems they are facing, as a 35- year veteran RN I find this disrespectful and so should all the nurses out there.",

Mass psychogenic illness typically affects adolescents or children, groups under stress and females disproportionately more than males. Symptoms often follow an environmental trigger or illness in an index case. They can spread rapidly by apparent visual transmission, may be aggravated by a prominent emergency or media response, and frequently resolve after patients are separated from each other and removed from the environment in which the outbreak began.

      "title": "Persistent Symptoms After a Concussion",
      "abstract": "Since my car accident a year ago, I am a mess. I can't think, I can't remember, and my head hurts all the time. I can't tolerate taking my kids to the mall. I can't work, I'm crying and yelling, and my house is a wreck. I can't stand being around my friends—and my marriage is on the rocks. I need help!Although the vast majority of individuals who have traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) categorized as \"mild\" and who have been diagnosed with \"concussion\" return to baseline functioning within several months, a subset of individuals experience persistent symptoms that affect quality of life. These symptoms may occur in less than 5% of individuals with mild TBI (mTBI), and are significantly influenced by non-injury-related factors (McCrea et al. 2009). Several factors are implicated in prolonged symptoms, including the pathophysiology of the injury, preinjury factors (e.g., preexisting psychiatric and subance use problems, previous TBI, intelligence, gender, age, personality style), and postinjury factors (social support, availability of adequate treatment, litigation/compensation) (Carroll et al. 2004; McAllister 2011). This paradigm serves as a guide to the evaluation of the patient with persistent symptoms after a concussion. What does the psychiatrist or mental health worker do when first confronted with a patient who has persistent symptoms? The first thing not to do is to assume that all problems that started after a bump on the head in a motor vehicle accident (or fall, or other injury) are due directly to the mTBI. Acute postconcussion symptoms are fairly consistent in their presentation and, by definition, are time limited. At the initial presentation, several symptoms predominate: problems with thinking, often described as feeling \"fuzzy\" or \"slowed down\"; physical problems, including insomnia, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and visual problems; and emotional and behavioral problems, including feeling depressed or tearful, anxious, and irritable. When symptoms spread into multiple domains, persist for more than a few months, and then begin to coalesce and globally impair—and increasingly erode—functioning, it no longer makes sense to speak of a \"postconcussion syndrome.\" We, along with others, do not believe the term postconcussion syndrome is valid or helpful, because symptoms do not represent a single pathophysiological process (McAllister 2011). Similarly, we discourage use of the term persistent (or chronic ) postconcussion syndrome (or symptoms ). We believe that, more accurately, this problem should be referred to as persistent symptoms that occur after a concussion. This term, which has diagnostic and therapeutic implications, represents acknowledgment that multiple factors play a role in the persistence of symptoms that may not reflect a continuation of those first evident after the so-called concussion. The constellation of symptoms that resulted directly from the concussion is no longer a unitary force driving dysfunction. The person who seeks attention for persistent symptoms that occur 6 or more months after TBI is already one who is atypical of most people who suffer concussions. Some combination of factors makes this individual different from those who have recovered typically after mTBI. If the person has been referred into the mental health system, someone likely has already come to this conclusion. Although some patients will present with psychologically uncomplicated neurological abnormalities that have been missed, the vast majority of persons presenting within the mental health system long after a concussion will have a dizzying array of symptoms that need disentangling. These individuals may face psychosocial challenges involving returning to work, relationships with family members, and interactions with the legal and insurance systems. Individual symptoms may amplify and exacerbate each other. The person may have lost confidence in himself or herself, and \"secondary\" depression may have developed. Our way of approaching cases of persistent symptoms that occur after a concussion requires a reframing of the core diagnostic question. The question is not whether or not this person has a TBI—a dangerous dichotomizing question that typifies medicolegal quagmires. TBI is an event, not an explanatory diagnosis. Instead, the question is this: If a TBI (mild or severe) did occur in the past, what are its present direct or indirect manifestations, are the persistent symptoms related to it, and what can be done to ameliorate them? Too often, patients are deemed not to have a \"real\" TBI and are then dismissed from the rehabilitation system and by other medical specialists. These patients usually have experienced a traumatic event, such as an accident or assault, that has its own emotional ramifications. The challenge to the mental health practitioner is to successfully work with such patients regardless of the etiology of their complex symptoms. Considering the person as a whole—and how the injury may have disrupted his or her sense of self (along neurological, physical, and psychological dimensions)—is more likely to lead to a practical approach to treatment. In this chapter, we—a neuropsychologist (T.K.) and neuropsychiatrist (J.M.S.)—offer our perspectives on factors that influence the persistence of symptoms after a concussion, and highlight important aspects of evaluation and treatment of such symptoms.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

In uncomplicated cases there was a close correlation between the duration of posttraumatic amnesia and the length of time off work. Some common causes of prolonged organic disability are mentioned. The recovery rate of patients suffering from posttraumatic emotional disorders, such as depression or anxiety, was proportional to the initial severity of injury, whereas the indefinite invalidism associated with so-called 'accident neurosis' was found to be rare in severely injured patients. 'Accident neurosis' also was more common in manual workers sustaining accidents at work than in the same occupation group after road accidents, or in non-manual workers.

      "abstract": "A general review of psychological reactions to a disaster situation in four groups of people is presented. Adult reactions (and management thereof) vary according to the phase of the disaster, viz (i) the pre-impact phase characterized by underactivity, development of anxiety symptoms or involvement in adaptive activities; (ii) the warning phase typically manifested by overactivity; (iii) the impact phase characterized by bewilderment, confusion or hysteria; (iv) the turmoil-recoil phase manifesting in emotional expression relating to the immediate past; and (v) the emotionally wounded or post-traumatic phase featuring reconstructive activity with some elements of anger and resentment. Reactions in children are usually transitory but may be influenced by parental psychopathology, separation anxiety or previous emotional disturbances. Typical adult reactions seen in the elderly may be compounded by what has been termed a high sense of deprivation. Relief workers are exposed to psychic stress in the form of greater responsibilities and role identification and many also show delayed reactions to the death and destruction observed.",

It is a normal state and a spur to action, but readily exceeds normal limits in intensity, duration and appropriateness to the stimulus or situation. Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

According to DSM‐5 , a diagnosis of pica requires symptoms to occur, at minimum, for a 1‐month period. Pica behaviors are inappropriate to the individual's developmental level and not part of a social or cultural practice. When the symptoms occur within the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, a diagnosis of pica is made only if the eating behaviors require clinical attention or significantly interrupt social functioning. Pica can be dangerous, depending on the amounts and types of substances consumed and the degree of nutritional deficiency that may be present. Although pica is an old illness, little is known about its prevalence and course because it has not been formally studied in high‐risk populations, and treatment is difficult to assess.",

In our work we have come to view feelings as indicators of general intrapsychic adaptation. On this basis, \"giving-up\" indicates not only an unpleasant feeling but includes a loss of self-esteem, a disruption in object relationships, a decrease in motivation, and an expectation that such a state may be enduring.

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms. Endogenous DepressionLet us take endogenous depression first.Though less common and less likely to be overlooked, the more severe cases will be described first.The onset is usually gradual, the patient often looks ill, his skin may be sallow and dry, the hair lustreless, and",

      "title": "Premenstruális szindróma és premenstruális dysphoriás zavar.",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak a mindennapi életben, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS és a premenstruációs dysphoriás zavar (PMDD) diagnózisa a következő kritériumok alapján állítható fel a Premenstruális Rendellenességek Nemzetközi Társaságának (International Society for Premenstrual Disorders – ISPMD) ajánlása szerint: a PMS esetében a nőnek 1–4 tünete van, amelyek lehetnek fizikai, viselkedési vagy affektív/pszichológiai jellegűek, vagy minimum 5 tünettel rendelkezik, melyek fizikai vagy viselkedési jellegűek. Ha viszont egy nőnek 5 vagy több tünete van, és ezek közül az egyik affektív tünet (például ingerlékenység, hangulatingadozás, düh) a fizikai vagy viselkedési tünetek mellett, akkor a pontosabb PMDD diagnózisa állítható fel. A diagnózisok megerősítéséhez az általános és a nőgyógyászati anamnézis mellett a páciens által naponta kitöltött prospektív skálák, például a menstruációs tünetek hatásának és súlyosságának prospektív nyilvántartása, továbbá a problémák súlyosságának napi nyilvántartási skálája jelent segítséget. A terápiás terv kialakításakor fontos figyelembe venni a tünetek súlyosságát, a nő fogamzási terveit vagy fogamzásgátlási igényeit, a társuló egyéb betegségeit és a korábbi kezelési módszerekre adott válaszát. A terápiás lehetőségek közé tartozik – a PMS és a PMDD súlyosságától függően – a rendszeres aerob testmozgás, a stresszoldás, a kognitív viselkedésterápia, a gyógyszeres kezelések (szelektív szerotoninvisszavétel-gátlók, kombinált oralis ösztrogén-progesztin fogamzásgátlók, GnRH-agonisták).

      "title": "A view of the helplessness and violence contained in chronic fatigue syndrome",
      "abstract": "In this work, originally undertaken 10 years ago, the author asks whether there might be any one particular psychopathology likely to be linked specifically with the physical illness known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalitis (ME), and whether CFS/ME aids and abets, and ‘fits’, an original mental state. She thinks the question cannot yet be answered, but hypothesizes that in some personality structures the onset of CFS/ME following a physical illness exacerbates negativity, and is an aspect of ordinary depression where there is a lowering of energy levels and a loss of zest for life, or it may reveal the pathological aspect of unresolved rage. Depending on the degree of pathological disturbance, working with and through the rage may or may not result in a resolution of the symptoms of ME. Some of the problems in the transference and countertransference relationship are considered, which make it extremely difficult to separate out reality from fantasy. There is then the further problem of the denial of the psyche by the patient as part of the violence inherent in the illness. The findings in this paper are corroborated by research undertaken over the last four years and these are incorporated into the paper. One case is presented, an example of ME in a borderline male patient in whom resolution could not be achieved. Copyright © 2005 The British Association of Psychotherapists",

      "title": "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder - Contemporary Analysis of Medico Legal Evidential Issues",
      "abstract": "In DSM-5, one of the two main classification schemes of mental disorders (APA, 2013), the diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has undergone multiple, albeit minor, changes. It now comprises four, not three, symptom clusters with the addition of persistent negative beliefs and distorted negative beliefs about oneself, plus a dissociative specifier (de-personalisation and derealization). Overall prevalence of this diagnosis is unlikely to change, but the greater heterogeneity of individuals being diagnosed with PTSD is probable (Zoellner et al, 2013). This paper summarises and discusses the many important medico-legal issues surrounding the PTSD disorder and its diagnosis and implications for both experts and lawyers. \r\nExperts, psychological and psychiatric, working in civil forensic context provide opinion on the presence or absence of psychological injury on the basis of diagnosis, causation and prognosis. The DSM diagnostic criteria for PTSD have been revised repeatedly since the mid-nineteenth century (Thomas, 2013) with PTSD being referred to as “Psychiatry’s problem child” (Gaughwin, 2008). Difficulties have included: ambiguity about traumatic nature of the event; absence of symptom development after traumatic nature of event; confounding prior history of traumatic events, and the coherence of traumatic experiences and their disruptive nature. \r\nThe application of the concept PTSD has been further complicated by apparent overlap with other conditions in which a wide array of cognitive, behavioural and emotional symptoms are also present; such as Borderline Personality Disorder. The concept of Complex-PTSD appeared in the clinical literature in the early 1990’s (Herman, 1992) and it helpfully made the link between multiple traumatic experiences in childhood and subsequent clinical presenta-tions in adulthood. Importantly, the array of cognitive, behavioural and emotional symptoms often associated with Borderline Personality Disorder and Psychosis, can then, in some cases, be seen as a way of coping with, and as a reaction to, repeated and cumulative traumatic experiences in childhood. \r\nMedico-legal implications of these changes and the overall diagnosis itself include the following key areas: Traumatic Stressor definition, differential diagnosis and comorbidity, causation, reliability and validity concerns, the use of legal tests and overall evidential robustness. \r\nAs with previous versions of DSM, the new DSM-5 has been criticized for both reliability and validity problems, and PTSD is no exception. For trauma survivors, clinical diagnosticians need to carefully assess pre-trauma functioning and consider that another diagnosis besides PTSD may be equally or even better warranted and have more accurate prognostic opinions.",

      "title": "Environmental influences on neuroticism : a story about emotional (in)stability",
      "abstract": "Een hoog niveau van neuroticisme is een belangrijke risico factor voor zowel psychische als lichamelijke problemen. Bovendien is neuroticisme niet alleen geassocieerd met problemen op het gebied van persoonlijk welbevinden maar ook met substantiele kosten voor de maatschappij. Het is daarom belangrijk om zowel de oorzaken als de gevolgen van neuroticisme beter te begrijpen. Gedrags-genetische studies suggereren dat ongeveer de helft van de verschillen tussen mensen in neuroticisme veroorzaakt wordt door omgevingsinvloeden. In dit proefschrift heb ik onderzocht welke levensgebeurtenissen voorafgaan aan veranderingen in neuroticisme, en hoe lang zulke veranderingen aanhouden. Hiertoe heb ik een aantal longitudinale studies uitgevoerd en de literatuur betreffende veranderingen in neuroticisme in volwassenen samengevat. De resultaten laten zien dat stressvolle levensgebeurtenissen (in het bijzonder sociale stress en conflict), die gekarakteriseerd kunnen worden als onvoorspelbaar, oncontroleerbaar, onverwacht, onwenselijk, of niet passend bij de normale levensloop, vaak worden gevolgd door een langdurige toename in neuroticisme. Echter, positieve levensveranderingen kunnen ook leiden tot een afname van neuroticisme. Daarnaast heb ik de betekenis onderzocht van de relatie tussen neuroticisme en veelvoorkomende psychische problemen, zoals angst, depressie, en middelenmisbruik. De resultaten laten zien dat neuroticisme een belangrijke voorspeller is voor de ontwikkeling van veelvoorkomende psychische problemen, en tot op zekere hoogte gezien kan worden als een maat voor meer milde problemen. De conclusie van dit proefschrift is dat het neuroticisme niveau van mensen mede afhankelijk is van zijn of haar omgeving, gevoelig is voor positieve en negatieve levensgebeurtenissen, consequenties heeft voor psychische gezondheid, en veranderlijker is dan lang werd gedacht.",

A large body of literature is available on the psychological and behavioral manifestations of PTSD; however, with regard to the more purely neuropsychological aspects of the disorder, they are still the subject of research and need greater clarity, although the roles of the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, locus coeruleus, and hippocampus in the onset of the disorder's characteristic symptoms have already been elucidated.",

      "title": "Comparing the concepts of mental load and stress",
      "abstract": "Abstract This paper delineates mental load and stress as two related concepts that originate from different theoretical frameworks. A proper distinction between the two concepts is important, not only for theory building, but because it may lead also to different interpretations of experimental results, and, consequently, to different recommendations in applied situations. High workload is regarded as an important but not a critical factor in the development of stress symptoms. It is quite possible to work hard in difficult and complex tasks, even under unfavourable conditions, without cognitive strain, psychosomatic complaints, or adverse physiological effects. High task demands can be met by mobilizing extra energy through mental effort. This 'trying harder' reaction is a normal and healthy coping strategy to adapt to situational demands. In contrast, stress is regarded as a state in which the equilibrium between cognitive and energetical processes is disturbed by ineffective energy, mobilization and negative emotions. Stress typically is characterized by inefficient behaviour, overreactivity, and the incapacity to recover from work. Stress is regarded as a state in which the physiological system is disorganized, which results in decreased well-being, sleeping problems, psychosomatic complaints, and increased health risks.

      "title": "Autistic phenomena in neurotic patients 1",
      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "title": "Crying Behaviour and its Impact on Psychosocial Child Development",
      "abstract": "Introduction All infants cry and all cry for a reason. Indeed, the attributions applied to early infant crying range from pain to anger to boredom. In the first months of life, crying is particularly salient as infants have relatively few effective methods of communicating their needs and states. Developmentally, crying in early infancy is distinguished by its temporal qualities. Several studies have demonstrated that infants typically show an increase in their crying across the first three months, with a peak at around six to eight weeks of age. Importantly, crying decreases significantly around three to four months of age, coinciding with important developmental changes in affect, non-negative vocalizations and motor behaviour. As crying is considered a normal communicative signal, developmental outcomes for children who cry within the normal range are not of concern. However, some infants exceed the typical pattern of crying, such as those who cry long, hard and inconsolably during the first three months or those who fuss frequently beyond three to four months of age. It is these infants who are often believed to be “at risk” for developmental problems.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy of Psychosis with Mixed Symptomatology",
      "abstract": "The introduction of potent physical and pharmacological therapies for psychotic conditions has increased the need for accurate diagnosis, not only in terms of assigning a patient to the diagnostic category but of assessing the various trends which may result in a very mixed symptomatology. Therapy, be it physical, pharmacological, or psychotherapeutic directed against one or the other of these components may frequently intensify other symptomatology. A suitable combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs plus the use of E.C.T. when indicated is necessary in the management of such cases. In the author's judgment this mixed symptomatology frequently results from the influence of personality trends and conflicts and particularly in these mixed states psychotherapeutic aid must also be included. In the words of Jules Masserman: “Even frankly psychotic behaviour patterns, whether depressive or schizoid, are not as sometimes inferred-merely shapeless fragments from a personality shattered by some hypothetical ‘mental disease’. On the contrary, the psychosis itself is an integrated syndrome which however socially deviant is adaptively operated at all levels from the physiologic to the most abstrusely symbolic.” (3)",

      "title": "Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter",
      "abstract": "Back pain in the working age population can coincide with work-related activities and may lead to temporary or permanent work disability in the case of functional impairment that interacts with workplace demands. This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

      "title": "Interphase between skin, psyche, and society: A narrative review",
      "abstract": "Disorders of the skin affect the psyche of a person significantly. The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

In 1995, the American Pain Society and others embraced pain as the fifth vital sign; yet pain differs from the other vital signs by being subjective, as opposed to being objectively measured, implying a psychological aspect. Psychological evaluation of a pain patient assesses underlying psychosocial aspects that play a role in reported pain symptoms. Early childhood abuse increases the likelihood of chronic pain later in life; pain may be precipitated by an emotional or physical trauma that reawakens anxiety from the original childhood experience. Precipitating traumas can include divorce, job loss, legal issues, grief, or death anniversaries. The earlier and more extensive the childhood trauma, the earlier and more extensive the physical report of pain in adulthood, and the greater the perceived need for opioid analgesia.",

Prolonged exposure to stressors, particularly during early life, is strongly associated with later psychiatric disorders. Underlying mechanistic connections between stress responses and development of psychiatric illnesses remain uncertain and typically appear to be nonspecific. Relevant candidate mechanisms are likely to include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by sustained excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. In turn, this process is influenced by and alters various central neurotransmitter and other molecular signaling systems that include glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and neurotrophic peptides. Additional manifestations of stress include altered neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, as well as oxidative neuron-damaging effects. The complex molecular systems involved in these processes present many opportunities for innovative pharmacological interventions that may have preventive or therapeutic benefits regarding mental illnesses arising from stress.",

      "abstract": "The effects of stress depend on the nature and duration of the exposure, with the triggering of molecular mechanisms that allow individuals to react to the stressful context.In particular, while acute stress induces the activation of circuits to ensure normal homeostasis and mediates adaptive responses, chronic stress exposure has detrimental and longlasting effects on brain functions.Indeed, chronic stressful life events act as precipitating factors for many psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorders.In this context, it is worthy of mention that there are differences in individual susceptibility, with some people displaying vulnerability to stressful events and others being resilient to the same adversities.Moreover, exposure to chronic adverse situations may leave permanent 'scars' in the individual, which confer enhanced vulnerability for relapse since it is possible that not all the systems impaired by chronic stress are restored during the remission.On these bases, it is fundamental to better understand the behavioral outcomes of stressful events as well as the molecular changes that may sustain them for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and approaches to treat stressrelated disorders and to promote resilience.",

It is similar to the “pressed state of mind——psycho-pressure syndrome” of psychopathology in appearance. The phenomenon arises from the activation of the physiological and psychological anxiety-preventing mechanism by certain behaviors.

      "abstract": "According to different sources of pain that victims feel,damage can be divided into three categories:body damage,property damage and psychological damage.Body damage and property damage are valued by judicial system,while victims' psychological damage assessment is always ignored.Psychological damage means psychopathic changes in the environment caused by psychological mechanisms,which is like clinical psychiatry post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder.In psychological view,it only refers to mental agony,psychological disorders and mental illness after personal crimes.It contains pain and suffering,mental shock,loss of enjoyment of life,loss of a shortened life expectancy and bereavement.Psychological damage can be divided into the short-term psychological damage and the long-term psychological damage.Based on the existing research,we can help victims rescue from the short-term psychological damage following five elements or principles;Promote a sense of safety,promote calming,promote a sense of self and collective efficacy,promote connectedness,and promote hope These are very similar to the psychological first aid approach,which emphasize the reduction of immediate distress and the promotion of the individuals' own coping abilities.The long-term psychological damage and relief needs help from professional psychiatrists or psychotherapists,and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy is shown to be effective and should be offered.The psychological damage can be evaluated from four aspects;crime type and severity,victims' personal characteristics,social support systems and social awareness and victims' attitudes.Therefore,a comprehensive rescue package can be made from information,practical help and emotional support When victims obtain information from judicial system about how to do judicial investigation,whether the perpetrator confessed,how the judge makes decision and why the offender can be released on parole or commutation,their sense of justice will be highly improved and they believe the procedure is fair so that their pain can be reduced.Practical help contains legal protection and economic aid.Emotional support comes from relatives and friends,the judiciary,the media and the public Relatives and friends,who play the most important role in helping victims to rescue,need to understand,tolerate victims and provide unconditional support;judicial officials need to avoid being indifferent to victims,which may cause second injury;media needs to respect victims and avoid overexposure case details;the public needs to treat victims equally and avoid discrimination,isolation and alienation.In conclusion,scientifically classifying and assessing victims' psychological damage can help establish a more equitable compensation system to help victims return to normal social life.",

Results of the study conducted via library literature found that the hysterical symptoms can be identified by three categories, namely symptoms from the angles of psychology, psychiatry and the Islamic treatment. From a psychological standpoint, is that students bear emotional disorders such as depressed mood, anxious, depressed feeling, irritable, sensitivity to the environment, and also self-adjustment problems, coping skills problems and so on. While in the angle of clinical, the symptoms of hysteria shown are identified through two different types of symptoms, namely subsection syndrome (dissociative hysteria) and transform syndrome (conversion disorder). Then, in the angle of Islamic treatment, hysterical symptoms can be seen through screaming, raving, aggressive action and out of control, crying, loss of consciousness and also appearing signs of interference by spirits and demons. The symptoms generally are the symptoms that lead to the hysterical symptoms to adolescent in Malaysia.

      "abstract": "Psychosocial factors affect resistance to a wide variety of diseases in animals. Stimuli often assumed to be noxious (e.g., electric shock, isolation housing) have been found to exert either potentiating or protective effects on an animal's response to potentially pathogenic stimulation. This variability has often been attributed to the influences of these stimuli on aspects of neuroendocrine or immunological function which are related to specific forms of pathogenic stimulation. The impact of a particular form of stimulation on the physiological state of the organism is also determined by the ability of the animal to cope with the stimulus environment. Factors shown to influence have included: (a) other aspects of the immediate environment at the time of stimulation; (b) prior experience with the same or other forms of stimulation; (c) the animal's ability to control its relationship to the stimuli by learning to escape or avoid them; (d) the availablility of relevant feedback regarding stimulus onset (e.g., warning signal), and (e) the stage of the disease process at which stimulation is imposed. These findings by various investigators indicate that it may be inappropriate to place a priori value judgements on any form of psychosocial stimulation or stress either as conceptually or operationally defined. The adaptive value of the psychosocial environment will depend upon its perception by the animal, the animal's ability to cope with the stimulus environment, and the particular disease system being studied.",

Somatization is an individual's unconscious use of the body or bodily symptoms for psychological purposes or psychological gain. As the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, notes, somatization is a “tendency to experience and report somatic complaints (physical symptoms) in response to psychosocial stress and seek health care services for them.” The AMA Guides also advises evaluators that “exclusion or inclusion of somatization disorder, factitious disorder, and/or malingering must be done with care.” A table lists developmental factors that may dispose to somatization (eg, somatizers are present in the family of origin, or coping mechanisms other than illness behavior are absent or unacceptable); a second table compares disorders that may involve somatization. Somatization is prevalent in clinical practice and is likely to occur with equal, or higher, frequency in the evaluation setting. The presence of somatization distorts symptom presentation and can exert a confounding effect on impairment assessment methodologies that rely on the accuracy of patients’ self-presentations.",

Few long-term studies concerning outcome of the depressions exist. At least the following factors can be assumed to indicate a favorable outcome: minor extent of depressive symptoms at the beginning, no severe personality disorder, absence of psychotic symptoms, no alcohol dependency or major physical illness, reliable social background, intellectual functions not being impaired, and skillful choice of antidepressant drug therapy regimes.",

The differential diagnosis of mood disorders from dementia and schizophrenia is taken up next in terms of natural history and biology. In-depth descriptions of the signs and symptoms of mood disorders are covered under emotional, cognitive, psychomotor, and vegetative subheadings. We finally give coverage to the chronic and subthreshold mood disorders, including dysthymia and cyclothymia. Knowledge of the psychopathology of mood disorders and their variants is of immense public health significance in light of their consequences in educational, conjugal, vocational, and physical health areas, and, more seriously, in their potential for suicidality.",

Negative attitudes towards people with mental illness are attributed to stigma. In the literature, stigma is regarded as something that is attached to a person ‐ like a badge or label. This is undermined by two facts. Firstly, it is the person who is regarded as disgraceful, not the illness or diagnosis, and secondly, the diagnosis of mental illness is itself evaluative. Mental illness is by definition bad, so to be diagnosed as mentally ill is to be defined as bad (or somehow wrong). The stigmatisation of the mentally ill will not stop until this negative evaluation is removed from diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common, recurrent, often underdiagnosed and undertreated disorder in older people. 10-15% of the elderly present depressive symptoms and 3% of that same population meet criteria for a major depressive episode. Several factors, such as psychosocial changes, may be related to the onset of depressive episodes. Retirement (often accompanied with feelings of loss of status, both in the family and in the society), the decrease of social contacts with a tendency to isolation, and the difficulties to adapt to new activities and routines, all lead to feelings of inadequacy, worthlessness and a poor self-esteem. The aim of this poster is to show and discuss the importance in recognizing some psychosocial factors that can predict the onset of depressive symptoms in the elderly. We report a case of a 66-year-old man, without previous psychiatric history, who presented a major depressive episode with psychotic features, after an important life event (retirement). Depression in older people has severe consequences, afflicting not only patients but also the caregivers. The amplification of previous disabilities associated with medical and cognitive disorders, the increased rate of mortality by suicide and the increased costs to the health care system are common consequences. To reduce such threats we propose a clinical and social approach that evaluates and regards the different stages of the life cycle and valorize the achieved experiences of older patients.",

      "abstract": "La maggior parte dei crimini con violenza sulla persona non avviene, come sembrerebbe ad un’analisi superficiale, in modo improvviso, come un «fulmine a ciel sereno», ma segue varie «tappe progressive», non sempre facili da identificare ma indispensabili per una comprensione del crimine e soprattutto per la sua prevenzione. La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc. In questo senso la diagnosi e la terapia (farmacologica o psicoterapica) sono di stretta competenza psichiatrica ed utili per la comprensione della criminalita ma non sufficienti perche non costituiscono gli unici fattori causali.",

Other aspects of personality are best understood as traits, rather than “disorders,” or as symptomatic changes that are acute and occur lower in the hierarchy of diagnosis than mood or psychotic states, and are caused by the latter. The common report of purported comorbidity is seen as an overestimation, with personality changes often being part of other conditions.

Except for these findings phenomenon as Premenstrual Syndrome and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, directly connected to menstrual cycle in women, is widely discussed. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a set of subjectively unpleasant mental and somatic symptoms. It appears in luteal phase of ovarian cycle. During menstruation it remits and disappears up to one week from its termination. DSM IV classified PMDD into the category of \"Other specific depressive disorders\" and further revision DSM IV-TR classifies PMDD as a separate strictly defined psychiatric diagnosis. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) does not include any specific category as PMDD or similar. The closest category F38.8 does not represent the core of the phenomenon because it relates only to general depressive symptomatology and does not give specific diagnostic criteria to menstrual cycle related mood disorders (Grady-Weliky, 2003). In the presented article, possible effectivity of PMDD treatment with the focus to antidepressants of SSRI type (Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors) is discussed. In spite of interesting and significant findings, the treatment of PMDD and accordingly PMS is above all multidisciplinary question and it must be treated like that.",

      "title": "CONTRIBUTIONS OF EXPERIMENTAL AND ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY TO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY1",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY An analysis of the influence of experimental psychology on clinical psychology has made it necessary to call attention to the middleman who mediates between experimental and clinical psychology–the abnormal psychologist. Whether the clinical and experimental approaches can be synthesized in one cranium remains an unanswered question, despite the success with which the synthesis has occurred in a few rare instances. With regard to diagnosis of disorders in behaviour, by which we mean a thorough knowledge of the cause of the illness and a description of its effect on the indivdual suffering from it, such knowledge is rarely available in the mental disorders, and hence we must fall back on mere description of the characteristic way in which the patient behaves–his Symptoms and signs (the complaints and the indicators which are observable even without complaint). However, the disordered behaviour may arise from a variety of causes. Furthermore, the same type of disorder may reveal itself differently in different patients depending upon their original equipment or their personality–i. e. the systematic behaviour which characterized them before the disorder became apparent. From this point of view there are three necessary sets of information required before a diagnosis can be made: (1) pre‐morbid personality, (2) current behaviour and characteristics, and (3) the cause of the change. What has experimental psychology done to help in these three areas? First, it has provided certain psychometric devices for evaluating the current behaviour of the patient when he comes to attention. Among these are such well‐known Instruments as intelligence tests, and personality tests and laboratory techniques for measuring physiological, sensory, perceptual, psychomotor and conceptual responses under controlled stimulation as well as under idling state conditions. It has, thus far, helped but little in the provision of methods for determining pre‐morbid personality, though retrospective accounts of development and instruments for recording such data are now being developed. Some prospective studies (Mednick) are also in progress. With regard to aetiology, attempts have been made to formulate scientific models which may underlie mental disorders, ranging from ecological, developmental, and learning, to heredity, internal environmental, and neurophysiological models, and considerable research under each of these models has been engendered in an attempt to uncover the sources of the disorder. Most of these studies are conducted by research psychologists and other research scientists in various research centres: The Maudsley Hospital, the NIMH, New York Psychiatrie Institute, Max Planck Institutes, University of Paris Faculté de Médecine, the Medical Research Council in Great Britain, etc. It is to be hoped that the result of these efforts will eventually benefit the practising clinician. The techniques for testing the hypotheses emanating from these models may be divided into (1) culture‐dependent, (2) culture‐fair, and (3) culture‐free. The first will vary considerably across cultures, since it has to conform to local cultural norms in order to detect deviation in response. The second will also vary from culture to culture, but translations or equivalence across cultures can be found. The third attempts to transcend culture by remaining relatively invariant from culture to culture. It is still too early to know whether culture‐free techniques can be developed, but to the extent that they remain relatively invariant from culture to culture, they may make possible more objective cross‐cultural studies. There is one danger facing clinical psychology–the danger of being swamped by the demands for service. In the U. S. this demand has produced a severe shortage of trained personnel and an even greater shortage of research clinicians or abnormal psychologists. The fortunate countries where this has not happened yet should take heed to avoid the North American pattern. One too easy road would be to adopt North American clinical psychology by translating most of the tests and techniques. It is to be hoped that this will not become a vogue, and that each country will enrich our knowledge of human behaviour through its own heritage rather than sacrifice its past to the American mould.",

      "title": "Charting late-life affective disorders",
      "abstract": "Good assessment tools may eventually lead to prevention strategies for depression and anxiety in older adults. For some, aging is associated with chronic medical conditions, disability, affective disorders, and social isolation. Affective disorders, including depression and anxiety, can result in increased social isolation, frailty, increased severity of illness-even mortality. Although there is abundant research on mood and anxiety disorders in the general population, studies of these disorders in older populations are limited. This article provides an overview of recent research, with an emphasis on research reviews and meta-analyses of depression and anxiety disorders among elders. It considers signs and symptoms, prevalence, biological and cognitive correlates, risk factors, assessment, and treatment. Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Most often, depressive and anxiety disorders are diagnosed with the Text Revision of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), from 2000 (the fifth edition will come out in 2013). When an individual presents with either depressive mood (sadness or irritability) or an inability to enjoy or take an interest in activities, plus four additional symptoms that occur most of the day, nearly every day for at least two weeks, they are diagnosed with a major depressive episode. Additional symptoms are changes in appetite or weight, changes in sleep and psychomotor activities (either restlessness or retardation), fatigue, a sense of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and suicidal ideation. Major depressive disorder is diagnosed when one or more major depressive episodes occur in the absence of mania or hypomania, and are not better accounted for by substance use or abuse, a medical condition, or a psychotic disorder. Anxiety signs and symptoms include excessive and persistent fear of objects, situations, or activities, which results in either an anxiety response (including fearfulness and physiologic arousal) or panic attack, and elicits avoidance behaviors. Anxiety symptoms include palpitations, shortness of breath, dry mouth, trembling, sweating, gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea, muscle tension, blushing, and in the case of specific phobias, dizziness or fainting. Apprehensive expectation or worry is a constant feature in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which can also include sleep disturbance, fatigue, irritability, feeling keyed up or on edge, muscle tension, and having difficulty concentrating, or the mind going blank. To qualify for diagnosis, symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. Research on the overlap of symptoms in anxiety and depression has revealed that almost all depressed patients have anxiety, but not all anxious patients are depressed (Barlow and Durand, 2008). Symptoms common to both disorders, referred to as negative affect, include worry, poor concentration and memory, anticipating the worst, irritability, hypervigilance, insomnia and unsatisfying sleep, crying, feelings of guilt, hopelessness, and a sense of worthlessness. Depression and Anxiety in Older Adults Late-onset depression first occurs in later life, which is variably defined across studies as 50 to 60 years of age. A review of clinical differences between early and late-onset symptoms of depression noted that older individuals present more frequently with anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure from activities formerly found enjoyable), cognitive deficits, psychomotor retardation, and weight loss (Variend and Gopal, 2008). It is associated with more marked sleep disturbances, hypochondriasis, and agitation (Barlow and Durand, 2008) than is early onset depression. Medical conditions and medications may contribute to both depression and anxiety symptoms. Plus, both anxiety and depression can manifest with physical symptoms. …",

However, factitious illness was not the best diagnosis in at least two of the cases (2 and 3) and probably a third (case 1). Conversion disorder, with or without a concurrent anxiety disorder, would be much more likely and helpful to consider in these cases. Conversion disorder involves a loss or alteration of physical function, often in the voluntary nervous system.

Twenty-nine of the women had had more than one child and first-born infants were not much more likely to be the focus of such feelings than second or subsequent children. Such profound disturbances of maternal affection and behavior often began immediately or very shortly after the birth, were usually prolonged and distressing and, with one exception, were specific to one child; such characteristics are best encapsulated by the descriptive term “maternal bonding disorder.” A postnatal mental illness and the memory of severe pain during labor were the only two factors significantly associated with the occurrence of such disorders and there was no direct evidence of any predisposing maternal personality traits or previous experiences.",

Deux grands types de plainte peuvent être opposés. La plainte suspecte de révéler une ma traduit un trouble de la mémorisation : les difficultés ne portent que sur le passé récent, elles retentissent rapidement sur la vie quotidienne et s’accompagnent de modifications du comportement qui amènent l’entourage à demander la consultation. Un examen rapide de la mémoire met en évidence un trouble du rappel qui n’est pas amélioré par les procédures de facilitation (indiçage). La plainte « bénigne » témoigne d’un trouble du rappel : elle porte aussi bien sur le passé ancien que récent, ne s’accompagne pas de modifications du comportement ou de diminution des activités de la vie quotidienne. La gêne est essentiellement subjective et le sujet vient seul consulter. L’examen montre une disparition des difficultés de rappel par l’indiçage. Cette plainte, essentiellement corrélée à des phénomènes psychoaffectifs dominés par l’anxiété, une baisse de l’estime de soi et un trouble de l’identité ne constitue pas un risque particulier d’évolution vers la démence.",

When people are depressed, they may identify problems or stressors as “causing” their depression. However, after recovery it often emerges that these causal attributions reflected negative perceptions and distorted cognitions rather than being of true etiological significance. This demonstrates the importance of using empirical diagnostic criteria, but also points to some of the problems that will arise when attempts are made to apply them in the elderly, particularly in the context of psychosocial stressors and losses that many elderly people must face.",

In contrast to what have been previously described as “subaffective disorders,” the condition presented here develops later in life, after a premorbid history of high social function and after long-lasting stresses or multiple losses before onset. Long-term course is that of an affective disorder, sometimes ending in suicide if not treated. It is also suggested that these patients undergo a process of regression under the influence of a chronic exposure to stress. The condition was initially observed among Eastern European immigrant patients but may also occur among individuals in high-stress jobs. The name “pseudoborderline syndrome” is proposed and it is speculated that masked affective disorders may appear in the form of “pseudo-syndromes”—pseudodementia, pseudomania, pseudohypochondriasis, pseudoborderline.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms seen in all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis rests on the identification of the specific features of particular disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of co-existing depressive symptoms, and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a course of individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, so it helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "abstract": "While pain has traditionally been understood within a medical model that equates pain to tissue damage or disease, this understanding is not consistent with everyday observations of pain or with clinical examples of persistent pain where there is often very little correlation between pain experienced and physical findings. This article considers psychological and multidimensional theories of pain, which are described within the historical context within which they were developed, including behavioural, cognitive, contextual and functional theories. Research into the multifactorial nature of persistent pain has tended to focus on mechanisms of pain development and maintenance or on the function of pain. Psychological approaches, which have focused on mechanism traditionally use disability, mood and quality of life measures to assess outcome, claiming little or no impact on pain intensity itself. By contrast, functional approaches include an explicit goal of reducing pain intensity, which is therefore measured as a key treatment outcome. Strong evidence exists from a range of sources of the important contribution of psychological and social factors to the experience of pain. However, evidence is still lacking about the specific mechanisms of change that are targeted by biopsychosocial interventions and about what treatment approach is likely to work best for whom.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis and treatment of late-life depression is often complicated by its clinical context. As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "title": "Attention deficit and hyperkinetic disorders in childhood and adolescence",
      "abstract": "Abstract The concept of ADHD arose from neurological formulations, but does not entail them, and the modern definition simply describes a set of behavioural traits. The historical evolution of the concept was described by Schachar. It began with the idea that some behavioural problems in children arose, not from social and familial adversity, but from subtle changes in brain development. The term ‘minimal brain dysfunction (MBD)’ was often applied, and covered not only disorganized and disruptive behaviour but other developmental problems (such as dyspraxias and language delays) presumed to have an unknown physical cause. MBD, however, stopped being a useful description when studies of children with definite and more-than-minimal brain damage made it plain that they showed a very wide range of psychological impairment, not a characteristic pattern (see Harris, this volume); and therefore it was invalid to infer the presence of brain disorder from the nature of the psychological presentation. The successor to the concept of MBD was attention deficit and hyperactivity: defined, observable behaviour traits without assumption of cause. ‘Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder’ (ADHD) in DSM-IV, and ‘Hyperkinetic Disorder’ in ICD-10, describe a constellation of overactivity, impulsivity and inattentiveness. These core problems often coexist with other difficulties of learning, behaviour or mental life, and the coexistent problems may dominate the presentation. This coexistence, to the psychopathologist, emphasizes the multifaceted nature of the disorder; to the sociologist, a doubt about whether it should be seen as a disorder at all; to the developmentalist, the shifting and context-dependent nature of childhood traits. For clinicians, ADHD symptoms usually need to be disentangled from a complex web of problems. It is worthwhile to do so because of the strong developmental impact of ADHD and the existence of effective treatments. Public controversy continues, but professional practice in most countries makes ADHD one of the most commonly diagnosed problems of child mental health.",

Method The case of a 17‐year‐old reporting escalating anxiety and migraine headaches is presented. A mental health assessment, parental information, screening tools, the Personality Assessment Inventory, ongoing observation, review of treatment regimens, consultation, and test results from other healthcare professionals are included in the ongoing assessment. Findings Symptoms including anxiety, auditory and tactile hallucinations, mood alterations, substance use, insomnia, and hypomanic symptoms are identified. The symptoms are suggestive of various diagnostic categories/diagnoses: mood disorder, prodromal schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Conclusion A thorough assessment does not necessarily lead to clarity of a diagnosis or diagnoses. Clarity may evolve over time; however, this does not eliminate the responsibility to treat the patient. It is important to consider and utilize evidence‐based treatments for the symptomatology and possible diagnoses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depressive illness in the elderly may be the result of a physical illness, the cause of secondary physical problems, coincidental tophysical illness or the result of an aetiological factor common to both conditions. Analysis of a cross‐sectional community sample of 396 elderly people showed depression to be significantly linked to presence of headaches, dyspnoea, and malignant disease known to the patient. It was not linked with heart disease nor arthritis per se , although those on anti‐arthritic or analgesic medication were significantly more depressed. The subjective description of physical health given by the patient also correlated strongly with depression. Depressive illness is sometimes unrecognized and frequently untreated with a consequent reduction in quality of life for many patients. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility that depression may coexist with physical illness, and that both conditions may need appropriate treatment. Further analysis of the above sample, controlling for physical illness and the additive effect of the variables concerned, showed depression to be positively correlated with adverse social factors such as not going out because of physical disability, feeling lonely, having a shopper and having hearing difficulties. The home help service was identified as a probable protective factor, implying the importance of this service in supporting the emotional as well as the physical needs of its clients.",

      "abstract": "The DSM-5, adopted in 2013, presents an updated list of affective disorders, which opens with a fundamentally new psychiatric diagnosis of a disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is diagnosed in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years and is manifested by chronic severe and persistent irritability or anger, as well as outbursts of anger disproportionate to the cause. It is obvious that the condition of a significant part of children and adolescents with a disruptive mood dysregulation disorder before the appearance of this diagnosis was mistakenly regarded as manifestations of bipolar disorder. The criterion of the fundamental difference between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and bipolar disorder is the absence of manic or hypomanic in the first of them. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by high comorbidity and is often combined with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder and attention deficit with hyperactivity, as well as anxiety. The course and prognostic significance of a disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as well as the choice of the most effective methods of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy require numerous further studies.",

It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

      "abstract": "Mental trauma can be caused by single or multiple traumatic events during lifetime or by long-lasting psychological and/or psychosocial stress. Especially chronic stress is a major burden of modern life and poses a clear risk factor for a plethora of somatic and psychiatric disorders. A role of the immune system in the development of stress-associated somatic and psychiatric disorders is very likely, given that: i) both stress-associated somatic and mental disorders go along with a dysregulated and over-reacting immune system; ii) risk factors for mental disorders promote immune hyper-reactivity to psychosocial stress and iii) chronic psychosocial stress induces chronic low-grade inflammation in healthy individuals. Because bone and especially bone regeneration are highly influenced by osteoimmunological mechanisms, we hypothesized that chronic stress and mental health problems might be associated with disturbances in bone homeostasis and healing. We investigated that in various preclinical models for chronic psychosocial stress during pregnancy, childhood or during adulthood. We found that stress during pregnancy induced an osteopenic bone phenotype in male offspring only, while early life stress induced a mild osteocatabolic phenotype in female mice only. In contrast, chronic adult stress did not affect the bones of female mice, while male mice displayed reduced long bone length and disturbed endochondral ossification. Because endochondral ossification is also important for secondary fracture healing, we investigated the effects of chronic adult stress on bone regeneration in male mice. Indeed, we found a disturbed inflammatory response towards fracture with increased number of catecholamine-producing neutrophils in the fracture hematoma. This led to reduced endochondral ossification and thereby contributing to disturbed bone regeneration. In conclusion, we could show that chronic stress during various phases of life might affect bone health in a sex-dependent manner and might also interfere with bone regeneration. Molecular mechanisms might be a dysregulated immune system and thereby osteoimmunological crosstalks.",

      "title": "Molecular markers of behavioral and emotional disorders",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Behavioral and emotional disorders are highly prevalent and heterogeneous common disorders in children and adolescents that include attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, depression and others. These disorders are frequently associated with the negative outcomes in adulthood, substance abuse and dependence, early pregnancy, persistent health problems, increased aggression, impulsivity, hyperactivity, inattention, obsessions, compulsions, anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, and criminality. These disorders are multifactorial and heterogeneous, with a complex etiology and strong genetic component. No single deficit is sufficient to explain all clinical cases of these disorders. Various child-specific, environmental, demographic, psychosocial, psychiatric, cognitive, developmental and genetic factors, with the stress exposure or adverse early life experiences, and a complicated interplay of these factors, contribute to the development and maintenance of these disorders and antisocial, violent and suicidal behaviors. The neurobiological basis of these disorders is not clear, but it is assumed to involve particular gene mutations and altered functions of the main neurotransmitter (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin /5-HT/) and neuroendocrine (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) systems. Materials and Methods: Platelet markers, monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and 5-HT, and polymorphisms of the genes for catechol-o- methyl-transferase (COMT) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined in male and female children with depression, OCD, ADHD, and phobias. Children were further subdivided according to the gender and suicidal behavior. Clinical diagnoses and suicidal behavior were assessed according to the DSM-IV criteria, different clinical scales and the psychiatric interview. Results: Significant differences were found in platelet 5-HT concentration between healthy boys and girls, but not among suicidal and non-suicidal children. Significant differences in the frequency of the Val66Met BDNF genotypes between suicidal, non-suicidal and healthy groups were detected. The distribution of the Val158/108Met COMT variants, and platelet MAO-B activity, did not differ significantly between the studied groups. Discussion: Our results did not support the hypothesis that reduced platelet 5-HT concentration or lower platelet MAO-B activity or Val158/108Met COMT variants present the risk factors for suicidal behavior in children. The significant contribution of the Met/Val genotype of the Val66Met BDNF to the observed significance suggested that Val66Met BDNF might present a risk factor for suicidal behavior. This result should be confirmed on the larger sample. Since the clinical features of behavioral and emotional disorders are heterogeneous and complex, further research of the risk factors for suicidal behavior is important to identify and properly treat children and adolescents prone to suicidal behavior, in order to prevent suicidal behavior, suicidal attempts and completed suicides.",

Without wishing to become involved in the discussion, in the publication the author tries to explain, on the basis of references to basic concepts found in insurance law (accident, initial damage, suitability of event, objectivity, epidemiological considerations), that in social insurance as well as in non-life insurance an objective insured event which has a severe emotional impact on the individual is a prerequisite for payment. The conclusions is that not every mental disorder which occurs after an insured event and which has quite rightly been classified as PTSD (or partial PTSD) on the basis of the symptoms involved in accordance with ICD-10/DSM-IV (criteria B-D) necessarily results in payment under insurance law.",

This failure occurred on the basis of chronic stress caused usually by relevant psychosocial stimulus, with clinical manifestation mainly in cardiovascular or immune systems followed with serious threaten of health and life. A lost of independence, loneliness, change of dwelling-place and living standard, low income, stages of confusion, mental disease, passive life attitude belong to psychosocial risks of the origin of geriatric maladaptation syndrome. Higher age and bad health status belong to biological risks of the origin of geriatric maladaptation syndrome. Clinical image of geriatric maladaptation syndrome has three phases (1. development of stress reaction, 2. full clinical image development of adaptation failure, 3. followed phase of adaptation reaction). It is a set of somatic disorders, which threaten a life of old people. These disorders arose in a consequence of inadequate adaptation to stress life event. Geriatric maladaptation syndrome is significantly different from mentioned adaptation disorders because of its clinical course and frequently unfavourable prognosis. In international classification of diseases it should have an independent item G 43.8.",

      "title": "A REVIEW ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MASSAGE THERAPY IN PAIN MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT",
      "abstract": "Pain is defined as a personal and unpleasant sensation affiliated with actual or potential tissue damage. Influenced by different levels of biological, psychological, and social conditions, it is a sensory and emotional experience that affects the holistic being and causes much agony and disability. Acute pain occurs in a sudden and sharp outburst that is resolved in less than six months, while chronic pain is characterized by persistent pain lasting over six months following its initial onset. Often mistreated or undertreated, patients diagnosed with this type of affliction commonl y experience fatigue, sleeping disorders, depression, and declining physiological and cognitive activity. The management of pain frequently requires a multidisciplinary approach, including medications, psychological support, and rehabilitation, to address the several aspects that factor into the patient’s pain experience. Massage therapy may be a substantial method of mitigating chronic pain. With the primary objective of reducing pain and agony while amending physiological and cognitive functioning, it clinically contributes to the betterment of the patient's subjective and objective well-being. This paper aims to review the effectiveness of massage therapy in pain management and treatment by presenting different massage techniques and their corresponding outcomes in patients.",

      "abstract": "Examples have been presented of children's behaviors that demonstrate the trauma-learning pattern of re-enactment, repetition, and displacement. They become persistent parts of the symptom complex of PTSD. The encapsulation phase occurs when the trauma event occurs and symptoms present themselves, but the events as yet are undisclosed. The trauma-specific behavior patterns, the general hyper-arousal symptoms, and the avoidant, numbing symptoms persist; the emerging disruptive behaviors are not linked to the traumatic event and reactions to the trauma. The response of the child's social and interpersonal context to the internalizing or externalizing behaviors post-trauma, continue shaping the internal cognitive schema of the child. When the child is unable to link ongoing, self-defeating, disruptive behavior to trauma experience, the underlying fear persists. This interferes with the child's ability to modulate emotions either through altering the persistence of refractory, self-limiting cognitive schema or the inability to use new experience to develop and grow. The flexibility of children to discriminate new information may be lost; the children are either numb to new information or hyperalert and perceive danger. Issues for treatment include children's distress over memories of the trauma and the lack of capacity to learn and develop from new interpersonal experiences. It has been our experience that nurses first must help the child relearn flexibility through self-observation, the element of self-soothing and calming behaviors, processing of new information, and strengthening of social relationships. With new and strengthened personal resources, the child then is able to begin to process the traumatic memories.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

Motor and phonic tics in a course of over 1 year that first occured before 18 years are the main features of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS). Psychogenic/functional (P/F) tics were considered as a diagnosis made per exlusionem in lack of agreement of diagnostic criteria. Recently, emphasis is in rather highlighting positive signs when making diagnosis of P/F tics. Several features in clinical course are important to differentiate GTS from P/F tics. Some of them are acute onset in adulthood, precipitation by physical event, absent family history of tics, variable, complex and inconsistent phenomenology, suggestibiity, distractibility. Premonitory urge, feeling of excessive energy and being 'wound up' prior tic, is a usual feature of GTS unlike in P/F tics. If present, such premonitory urge have different qualitative and quantitative marks. Another possible diagnostics tool could be the beireitshaftspotential, an event-related electrical potential associated to initiation of movement which is divided in two phases, early (B1) and late (B2) phase. Early phase, whose occurence in some papers has been reported prior P/F tics, is absent prior performed tic in GTS. In everyday clinical practice differentiating GTS from P/F tics is often very challenging but taking proper medical history, paying more attention to positive signs and possibly using electroneurophysiology tests could contribute in making the right diagnosis.",

      "title": "Anxiety disorders including post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)",
      "abstract": "Increasing numbers of studies of correctional populations have emphasized diagnosis with structured clinical instruments over the past two decades. These studies have primarily focused on serious mental illness (i.e., psychotic and mood disorders), substance use disorders, and personality disorders. The focus has made sense because of the need to identify the severely mentally ill who are incarcerated and to identify the most common disorders. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias. One anxiety disorder that stands apart from others is PTSD, which is prevalent at much higher rates in both incarcerated men and women than in the community. Despite this fact, other anxiety disorders are often co-morbid and add to overall disease burden and impair ability to function. Individuals with a greater disease burden (i.e., number of diagnoses, symptom counts) have worse outcomes than those with uncomplicated disorders. These impaired outcomes include a deteriorating trajectory of illness, increased health service utilization, poor prognosis, and increased likelihood of morbidity and mortality. Thus, while anxiety disorders may not be the primary focus of the correctional system, they must be recognized as important. Unrecognized anxiety disorders can result in behavior that is disruptive and may appear to be volitional. They can also lead to overutilization of health services that are already facing substantial demands. Appropriate, available, and consistent assessment, diagnosis, and treatment that are well integrated can successfully intervene in the range of anxiety disorders that present in correctional settings.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "title": "Inquadramento diagnostico e gestione farmacologica della depressione senile Assessment and pharmacological management of elderly depression",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression is chronic and disabling and is an important factor for elderly suicide. The prevalence of depression in the elderly has attracted extensive research effort and yelded a wide range of estimates, depending on diagnostic criteria, the method of detecting depression, the experience of the interviewers and, most importantly, the characteristics of this population. Major Depression appears to be less common in the elderly than in younger adults, but subsyndromal depression is more prevalent. DSM diagnostic criteria require either depressed mood or loss of interest, but these symptoms appear to be less prominent in the elderly, being anxiety, irritability and physical symptoms more significant indicators of elderly depressive states. Depression in the elderly is essentially heterogeneous and has a multifactorial etiopathogenesis (Fig. 1): this has contributed to its underrecognition, underestimation and undertreatment. The “atypical” clinical presentation of depression in the elderly as somatic symptoms, anxiety, changes in functional ability, loss of capacity to enjoy life or loss of interest in usual activities, can be misleading for the clinician and masks an underlying mood disorder. Even “pseudodementia” is clinically important since it may result in failure to recognize and treat either depression or dementia. Comorbidity with a physical illness such as cardiovascular disease or other psychiatric symptoms (e.g. anxiety) is frequent in late-life depression, and the presence of one or more medical illnesses may influence the diagnosis of depression; moreover, it represents a negative prognostic factor for response to antidepressant therapy. The pharmacological management of depression in late life is complicated by physiological changes associated with aging (Fig. 2), higher sensitivity to develop side-effects, concomitant medical disorders with drug-drug interaction phenomena and compliance problems. These factors need to be carefully taken into account when selecting antidepressants for the treatment of depressive states in the elderly. Antidepressants are as effective in the elderly as they are earlier in life. The development of newer antidepressants has focused on compounds that are better tolerated, with reduced unwanted effects and more likely to be used in long-term treatment. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonergic/Noradrenergic Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI), (e.g. venlafaxine) and Noradrenergic/Serotonergic Specific Antagonist (NaSSA), (e.g.mirtazapine), show a more favourable side-effects profile and appear to be more suitable for the treatment of elderly depression. In selecting the appropriate treatment, the physician should take account of concomitant illnesses and current therapies, choosing an agent with a simple once-daily regimen and a larger pharmacodynamic and therapeutic spectrum (e.g. on depressive and anxiety symptoms). However, a comprehensive management of elderly depressive states should include not only the physician, but also a psychological and psychosocial support, which appears important to explore stressors for depression and to educate patients and their families about depressive illness and its treatment.

      "abstract": "In any group of people, whether it be a family, a social circle or a work unit, there are individuals who are loath to admit that they are under stress of any kind. Others are prepared to accept that they do experience stress but regard it as an inevitable part of life. Until stress becomes severe there is no great danger, but as the onset of stress is usually a gradual process its warning signals are not easily recognized and may be easily misinterpreted. The symptoms of stress are many: irritability and frustration; altered sleep patterns despite increasing fatigue; laughter is less frequent; concentration is reduced; increased sensitivity to noise; and inability to make decisions. There are also physiological symptoms such as high blood pressure, increased heart rate, sweating, numbness, lack of bladder and bowel control, indigestion and tension headaches. In this chapter we shall examine some of the physiological and behavioural effects of stress from which people suffer during the course of their lives.",

      "title": "Resilience, prevention and positive psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Traditionally, the focus of psychiatry has been to assess the clinical presentation of so-called 'disorders of the mind' and define diagnoses in order to establish successful therapeutic strategies. However, psychiatrists have become aware of the fact that this is not enough. Indeed, only a small percentage of patients discharged from hospital after their first episode of mania or psychosis, for example, had full syndromal and functional recovery in the long-term.1 Furthermore, social and vocational recovery is even more difficult to reach than clinical compensation.1 As a consequence, a shift towards a relatively new paradigm called 'positive psychiatry' is necessary. Not only prevention in general and primary prevention in particular, but also mental health promotion should be the focus of this approach. In clinical practice, positive psychiatry should promote well-being, personal growth and the reduction of perceived stress. Its background relies on certain psychobiological traits, mainly resilience, optimism and coping strategies, which can be promoted, and also on environmental factors, such as family dynamics, social support, and access to medical and psychological care.2 The three levels of prevention in mental health could be feasible targets of positive psychiatry interventions. Firstly, primary prevention is aimed at preventing the occurrence of a disease. This is done by preventing exposures to hazards or increasing resistance to a disease. An example of this is provided by the global pandemic situation. The ongoing vaccination campaign against the SARS-CoV-2 is aimed at preventing infection in an increasingly large part of the population. Nowadays, a similar, even though less extensive, effort is conducted in mental health to improve mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities in the face of future stressful events.3 This should be particularly promoted in individuals at higher risk of developing a psychiatric disorder, such as siblings of individuals suffering from a psychiatric condition. Interestingly, Kessing et al.4 in a recent nationwide population-based longitudinal study identified that the rates of presentation of any psychiatric disorder in siblings of patients suffering from bipolar disorder (BD) were increased not only in their 20 s but also above 60 years of age. As a consequence, preventive strategies should be provided not only during adolescence but should be implemented throughout life. In the case of individuals that have already experienced psychiatric symptoms, secondary prevention aims to reduce the impact of a disease that has already occurred. Providing targeted help and support to patients in their early stages is of paramount importance.5 Social, clinical and cognitive factors associated with more resilient trajectories of psychosocial functioning in the long-term in patients that presented a first episode of psychosis have been identified, providing insights for early interventions. Hence, less severe depressive and negative symptoms, a better premorbid adjustment and a diagnosis of BD and related disorders in comparison with schizophrenia and other psychoses were identified as clinical features associated with mild impairment and improving psychosocial functioning in the course of the disease.6 An important aspect of this 'new' paradigm in psychiatry is that not only the clinical condition but also other characteristics of the individual should be the focus of early interventions. An example is cognitive reserve, which is gaining momentum since it contributes to neuropsychological and functional outcomes in patients, particularly in those at the earlier stages of disease.7 Indeed, cognitive reserve represents a measure of 'intellectual resilience' since it was conceptualized as the contribution of premorbid intelligence quotient, years of education and leisure activities in promoting more efficient cognitive networks and therefore, allowing better clinical, cognitive and psychosocial outcomes over the long-term.8 Not only personal skills but also the social environment plays a major role in individual functioning. In particular, the family environment, being the first environment with which the individual comes into contact, can exert its effect as a protective or a risk factor depending on the family dynamics. Two years after a first psychotic episode,9 worse psychosocial functioning in psychotic patients has been seen to be associated with lower rates of active-recreational and achievement orientated family environment and with higher rates of moral-religious emphasis and control in the family. Similarly, in those suffering from a mood disorder, worse psychosocial functioning was associated with higher rates of conflict. This might have important implications for early interventions programs that should engage not only patients but also their caregivers. Again, the COVID-19 pandemic provides a useful example of how positive psychological traits are important even when stressful and unpleasant conditions occur. Particularly, resilience is a topic of increasing interest since it could provide a new framework to understand trajectories of mental illness, particularly in terms of improved mental health outcomes. Resilience is a dynamic process of adaptation to challenging life conditions encompassing several aspects of personal resources and can be identified as the 'emotional version' of cognitive reserve. A recent study10 evaluated mental health outcomes associated with bad resilience and predictors of good resilience in a sample of psychiatric patients and in the general population after the lockdown measures have been imposed by the Spanish government to overcome the contagion situation. Whilst the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with bad resilience, having pursued hobbies and conducted home tasks as well as a higher level of organization in the family were predictors of good resilience in psychiatric patients. Interestingly, a controlling family was associated with bad resilience even in those participants without a psychiatric condition. Therefore, therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing resilience,10 healthy life-style behaviours,11 coping strategies12 and peaceful family environment might have important implications in terms of mental health outcomes, not only in those patients already suffering from a psychiatric condition but also in the general population. Both primary and secondary preventive interventions aimed at promoting good mental health in young people, improved quality of life, insight, cognitive and social skills, physical and sexual health as well as academic and occupational functioning.13 Nonetheless, the quality of the evidence of interventions aimed at increasing subjective well-being and aspects of positive psychiatry is still low.14 Finally, tertiary prevention aimed at supporting patients with mental health disorders to have a good quality of life and better psychosocial outcomes, has also demonstrated to have an impact on prognosis. Indeed, patients who receive care through specialized treatment programmes have better illness outcomes than do those without this support.15 Interventions applying positive psychiatry concepts should be improved and provided to the different subjects being the targets of all prevention levels. Positive psychiatry can open new avenues of treatment strategies, which go beyond the traditional psychiatry approach.2 Firstly, when applied to the general population, these interventions might promote good mental health and avoid 'medicalisation'. Moreover, in those individuals at higher risk of developing a psychiatric disorder, the occurrence of the disease can be prevented or softened. Finally, patients both in the early and in the late stages of the disease can benefit from these interventions, since they could reduce disabling symptoms, improve psychosocial functioning and allow the patients to feel empowered to manage their own life, avoiding stigma, enhancing awareness and increasing quality of life. This is indeed the time to bring together positive psychiatry and precision psychiatry.

      "title": "Should Prolonged Grief Be Reclassified as a Mental Disorder in DSM-5?",
      "abstract": "The proposed changes to DSM-5 will create new categories of mental disorder (referred to here generically as Prolonged Grief Disorder'' [PGD]) to diagnose individuals experiencing prolonged intense grief reactions to the loss of a loved one. Individuals could be diagnosed even if they have no depressive or anxiety symptoms but only symptoms typical of grief (e.g., yearning, avoidance of reminders, disbelief, feelings of emptiness). The main challenge for such proposals is to establish that the proposed diagnostic criteria validly discriminate a genuine psychiatric disorder of grief from intense normal grief. With this test in mind, I evaluate the soundness of four empirical arguments and one conceptual argument that have been put forward to support such proposals: (1) PGD has discriminant validity because distinctive, pathognomonic symptoms distinguish it from normal grief; (2) PGD has discriminant validity because it identifies grief symptoms that are of greater absolute severity than in normal grief; (3) PGD has predictive validity because it implies a chronic, interminable process of grieving, thus a derailment of the normal process of grief resolution; (4) PGD has predictive validity because it predicts negative mental and physical health outcomes unlikely in normal grief; and (5) PGD has conceptual validity because grief is analogous to a wound or, alternatively, lengthy grief is analogous to a wound that does not heal. Upon close examination, each of these arguments turns out to have serious empirical or conceptual deficiencies. I conclude that the proposed diagnostic criteria for PGD fail to discriminate disorder from intense normal grief and are likely to yield massive false-positive diagnoses. Consequently, the proposal to add pathological grief categories to DSM-5 should be withdrawn pending further research to identify more valid criteria for diagnosing PGD.",

Withdrawal symptoms can act as a protection against oneself and the child, entailing disorders of the mother-child relationship. Three clinical situations are exposed, exemplary of these problems.

The characteristic feature of DSED is disinhibited, socially indiscriminate social behavior that begins prior to the age of five years. Children with DSED exhibit reduced reticence in approaching unfamiliar adults, overly familiar behavior, lack of checking back with their caregiver after venturing away, and willingness to leave with an unfamiliar adult. The assessment includes a psychiatric evaluation and observation of how the child interacts with their caregiver and unfamiliar adults. There are no medication treatments for DSED; however, psychiatric comorbidities may benefit from psychopharmacology. The cornerstone of treatment for DSED is providing the child with an emotionally available attachment figure. It may be necessary to limit the child’s exposure to strangers for several months to reduce socially indiscriminate behaviors.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Intense or chronic stress can have long-lasting consequences in an individual's health, and can be the cause of debilitating mental illnesses. A very common mental illness induced by traumatic stress is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a syndrome of symptoms indicative of emotional dysfunction, which develop after exposure to life-threatening events, or very stressful situations of different nature. Prevalent symptoms are fear and anxiety, which become particularly intense during exposure to situations reminiscent of the traumatic events that precipitated the disease. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder of considerable prevalence and morbidity and can affect persons of any age and ethnic or socioeconomic background. It is, unfortunately, a far too common result of participation in wars. In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested that the prevalence of PTSD is even higher in inner city communities exposed to compound community trauma. It is imperative, therefore, to understand the neurobiological mechanisms by which exposure to traumatic stress leads to PTSD in order to foster the development of new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of stress-related affective disorders such as PTSD. Clinical evidence indicates that certain stress-related affective disorders such as PTSD are associated with changes in the amygdala's excitability. The amygdala is a key component of the brain's neuronal network that determines the emotional significance of external events",

Even symptoms of conditions such as psychoses and dementia can present as relatively normal behaviour. This paper considers depression in late life as an example of this tension. On the one hand, depressive symptoms may be viewed as an ‘understandable’ response to bereavement or physical illness, while, on the other, it can be a serious, disabling and life-threatening condition if left untreated. Primary care has a key role to play in supporting depressed older people, through improved pattern recognition and diagnosis, by tailoring effective treatments to fit the individual, and by providing or signposting the older person to information and advice. This is a pivotal role that primary care plays in relation to other mental health problems that older people experience.",

We addressed this issue by introducing, and examining the effects of, targeted rejection (TR), which involves the exclusive, active, and intentional social rejection of an individual by others. Twenty-seven adults with major depressive disorder were administered an interview-based measure of life stress. Severe life events that occurred prior to the onset of depression were subsequently coded as TR or as non-TR. Participants who experienced a pre-onset severe TR event became depressed approximately three times faster than did their non-TR counterparts. These findings highlight the potential importance of TR as a marker of hastened depression onset and demonstrate how refining characterizations of stress may advance our understanding of depression.",

From 1980-ties, adolescent depression is seen as the same problem as with adults. The diagnosis of depression in adolescents is based on adult diagnostic criteria. Today, there is a more generally accepted standard that adolescence depression is essentially the same phenomenon as adult depression but with some development specific modifications. As compared with adults, adolescents with depression demonstrate a more variable course. The adolescent with depression may exhibit somatic complaints, school difficulties and deconcentration rather than depressed mood. Three conceptualizations of depressive phenomena during adolescence have been presented in the literature: (1) depressed mood alone, (2) depressive syndrome, and (3) depressive disorders. Compas, Ey and Grant have compared and integrated different approaches to a synthesis that reflected a comprehensive model of depressive phenomena during adolescence. Depressed mood, syndromes, and disorders are integrated as 3 levels of depressive phenomena in a hierarchical and sequential model.",

In turn, relapse has wider implications for the family in general, for the provision of medical and social facilities and for health economics. There are no generally accepted criteria for relapse but outcomes such as violence or suicide, extreme psychotic behaviour and rehospitalization have been used. Less obvious criteria include major and minor symptom worsening and prodromata. Relapse is a relative term and must take into account the following factors: the patient's condition before the original onset of illness; his level of functioning before the present episode; the severity of the relapse in terms of symptom severity, duration and interference with personal functioning; the appearance of any new symptoms or behaviour patterns; the type of treatment given prior to relapse, and hence relatively ineffective; the type of treatment given during relapse, and its efficacy. Relapses often follow a pattern which may be fairly specific to each individual patient. Social factors may have predictive power but these need validation in different samples.",

      "abstract": "The major laboratory findings of “Cushing's syndrome” (i.e., hypercqrtisolemia, loss of the normal diurnal cortisol rhythm, increased renal excretion of cortisol and cortisol metabolites, and abnormal resistance to dexamethasone suppression) are common to major depressive disorder. Conversely, a majority of patients with Cushing's syndrome of any cause report neuropsychiatric symptoms, most often changes in mood and cognition. Only the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Cushing's disease have been well documented; they differ from those of major depression in important ways. In Cushing's disease, the depression, if present, is intermittent rather than sustained, and there is weight gain (rather than weight loss), more irritability, and less psychomotor retardation, withdrawal, and hopelessness. Depression, irritability, and loss of libido often occur early in Cushing's disease, sometimes even before patients are aware that they have physical symptoms other than weight gain. The quality of the neuropsychiatric symptoms and their early occurrence in Cushing's disease argue against a nonspecific response (e.g., demoralization) to severe physical illness. After the Cushing's disease is cured, the neuropsychiatric symptoms usually abate, but their resolution does not always parallel the resolution of endocrine symptoms. The pathophysiology of the hypercortisolemia in depression and Cushing's disease seem to reflect abnormalities in different loci (e.g., at or above the hypothalamus in depression and at the pituitary in Cushing's disease).",

      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "Seasonal affective disorder is a mood disorder that is a subtype or qualifier of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It is characterized by depressive symptoms that occur at a specific time of year (typically fall or winter) with full remission at other times of year (typically spring or summer). Possible risk factors include family history, female sex, living at a more northern latitude, and young adulthood (18 to 30 years of age). With the temporal nature of the mood episodes, diagnosis requires full remission when the specified season ends and two consecutive years of episodes in the same season. First-line therapy for seasonal affective disorder includes light therapy, antidepressants, and cognitive behavior therapy, alone or in combination. Commercial devices are available for administering light therapy or dawn simulation. The light intensity and duration of treatment depend on the device and the patient's initial response, but 2,500 to 10,000 lux for 30 to 60 minutes at the same time every day is typically effective. Lifestyle interventions, such as increasing exercise and exposure to natural light, are also recommended. If seasonal affective disorder recurs, long-term treatment or preventive intervention is typically indicated, and bupropion appears to have the strongest evidence supporting long-term use. Continuing light therapy or other antidepressants is likely beneficial, although evidence is inconclusive. Evidence is also inconclusive for psychotherapy and vitamin D supplementation.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a necessary component of life. All living things go through periods of stress at some point in their existence. The word \"stress\" has become widely used in everyday speech in recent years. Stress, in Lazarus's definition, is an internal process that arises when an individual perceives that a demand exceeds their capacity to adequately respond to it, and when failing to meet that capacity can have significant negative repercussions [1]. The body reacts to stress in a manner akin to how it reacts to danger. A condition of wellbeing known as mental health can motivate people to make positive decisions. In a similar vein, when someone is dealing with an issue, it negatively impacts their mental health and causes their mental wellness to decline. In industrialized nations, menopause typically begins between the ages of 40 and 58. 52 is the average age in the United States (Trusted Source). Some will experience it sooner as a result of a medical condition or treatment (ovaries removed, for example). Hormonal changes brought on by menopause might result in mood swings, heat flashes, and other symptoms. The main focus of the study was to swot on “Stress among Women during Menopause- Impact on Mental Health”. Women who are in the age group of 45 -55 years were selected for the study. The sample consists of 60 women belongs to Madakasira village, Sathya Sai district for the study. Menopause problems questionnaire was developed by the researcher with the guidelines of subject experts it was pre-tested to other sample before going to actual sample. According to the study, women experience a great deal of irritation and fury during menopause, along with anxiety, forgetfulness, low self-esteem, confidence loss, low mood, and feelings of melancholy or despair. These symptoms are sometimes referred to as \"brain fog\" and/or \"lost words.\"",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The development and persistence of chronic pain is best understood in the context of a biopsychosocial framework. Following a historical overview of pain theories, we present the leading theory of chronic pain, which is a biopsychosocial theory incorporating psychological, affective, cognitive, and physiological factors as key contributors to the development and maintenance of chronic pain symptoms. We summarize evidence supporting the important contribution of each of these factors and how they interact to culminate in the chronic pain experience. We present methods for assessing these constructs in pain patients and discuss how the cognitive-behavioral treatment perspective may be utilized either independently or as part of an intensive rehabilitation approach to decrease pain severity and improve physical and emotional functioning.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords:\r\n\r\nchronic;\r\npain;\r\npsychology;\r\ncognitive;\r\nbehavioral",

Thus, symptom severity is a key issue of the spectrum of mood states.

Recent research has demonstrated how important it is to recognize subthreshold states of mania and depression, as they can have a major impact on both social functioning and quality of life, since many patients with mood disorders spend much time in subthreshold disorders, i.e. cyclothymia, dysthymia, or neuroticism. While the severity spectrum of the states of mania and depression has been accepted as evidence-based, we still lack a validation of the mood polarity spectrum in long-term follow-up studies.",

      "title": "Evaluating Adolescents With Fatigue",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Unexplained fatigue in adolescents is a common and frustrating complaint that can pose a challenge for even the most experienced physicians. Although the cause usually is benign and self-limited, occasionally there is a serious underlying disorder. This symptom cannot be dismissed without performing a thorough medical history, detailed psychosocial profile, and careful physical examination. Selective use of laboratory and radiologic studies should be considered when specifically indicated. If the cause remains unclear, sequential visits often provide clues for the practitioner and reassurance for the family. The purpose of this article is to offer guidelines to the clinician caring for adolescents who have prolonged, unexplained fatigue and to stress the value of a thorough history and physical examination.For purposes of this discussion, fatigue will be defined as abnormal exhaustion after usual activities. An arbitrary cutoff of 1 month is used to distinguish acute from chronic fatigue. The term chronic fatigue syndrome is avoided because criteria for this condition are not clearly established in children or adolescents, and data must be extrapolated from studies in adults. The term neurally mediated hypotension is used to describe a fall in blood pressure in response to assuming the upright posture, physical events, and emotional stressors. Affected patients may be syncopal or presyncopal. Neurally mediated hypotension also is referred to in the literature as neurocardiogenic syncope, vasovagal reflex, vasodepressor syncope, and autonomic dysfunction.The best way to approach a problem of this nature is to establish a good relationship with adolescents and their parents so they will trust your recommendations and not pressure you into unnecessary tests or referrals. The examination begins when the family enters the office by greeting the patient first to establish a direct relationship immediately. It is worthwhile to obtain the history while the patient is fully clothed because adolescents usually feel more relaxed under these circumstances. Initially, the patient and parents are interviewed together, assuring both parties that there will be adequate time later to speak with the examiner alone. While taking the history, the clinician should demonstrate a willingness to listen and be particularly alert for any clues of a hidden agenda or an underlying illness.More sensitive issues are discussed with the patient alone. Every effort must be made to assure privacy and confidentiality when obtaining personal information from adolescents. Credit must be give to Cohen, who has refined a method for organizing the psychosocial history that was developed by Berman in 1972. This system has been expanded and modified further at the SUNY Upstate Medical University Adolescent Medicine Center in Syracuse. The questions are structured in an easily remembered format that stresses the importance of connecting with adolescents HEADS FIRST (Table 1). This approach emphasizes that “getting into adolescent heads” is just as necessary as performing a physical examination. In many instances, the information obtained during the psychosocial interview is key to elucidating the cause of unexplained fatigue in teenagers.The issues outlined in Table 1 can be addressed with the traditional verbal approach, using the suggested cue words, or by having the patient complete a self-administered personal questionnaire. With either method, the questions should be answered privately and reviewed confidentially with the examiner unless the patient specifically requests otherwise. Most parents respect their adolescents’ need for privacy and appreciate the opportunity for them to receive one-on-one counseling with an experienced health professional.There is considerable overlap in the signs and symptoms caused by the various underlying conditions associated with fatigue. Manifestations are often subtle and should be correlated closely with the overall clinical picture. Thus, clinicians must have a high index of awareness when interpreting historical data, physical findings, and other pertinent information in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue.The onset, severity, and duration of the fatigue as well as any aggravating or relieving factors are explored when taking the history. Particular attention should be paid to any significant changes in the patient’s physical activity level, exercise tolerance, and ability to keep up with peers. Lack of sleep due to getting to bed later, difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime awakening, or getting up earlier in the morning should be considered. A careful review of systems is also essential, with close attention to any constitutional symptoms, such as unexplained fevers, chills, sweating, anorexia, weight loss, or lymphadenopathy, which may suggest the presence of an underlying infection, malignancy, or other inflammatory process. A history of an antecedent “mono-like” illness with negative diagnostic studies is relatively common and suggestive of an infectious cause. However, the significance of this association is unknown.Recent weight gain as well as weight loss should alert the clinician to the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or underlying medical condition. Teenagers who have eating disorders often resort to desperate, even dangerous measures to improve their self-esteem or to enhance their image. Attempts at weight reduction often involve self-injurious behaviors, such as severe caloric deprivation, excessive exercise, self-induced vomiting, and the use of appetite suppressants, laxatives, diuretics, or emetics. Fatigue from rapid fluid shifts or hypokalemia is especially common among bulimics, whose weight may fluctuate dramatically as a result of the frequent episodes of binging and purging. In contrast, patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa usually seem to have boundless energy, even in a state of severe emaciation.Adolescents who engage in competitive activities in which thinness or “making weight” are judged important to success are believed to be particularly susceptible to unhealthy weight control practices. Such activities include body building, cheerleading, dancing (especially ballet), distance running, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, horse racing, modeling, rowing, swimming, weight-class football, and wrestling. As the preoccupation with thinness supersedes the desire to be healthy, physically active young women are at risk for a group of signs and symptoms known as the female athlete triad. Lack of information and the strong desire to win contribute to this condition, which consists of abnormal eating patterns, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. In many instances, these girls become less competitive as they begin to tire more easily and have less stamina.Adolescents should be screened for stress, anxiety, and depression, which frequently are associated with fatigue in this age group. The three most common sources of conflict are problems at home, strained peer relationships, and school-related difficulties. Having a job or not having a job for those in financial need may be an added source of pressure. The practitioner also should look for feelings of sadness, changes in behavior, difficulty concentrating, declining school performance, and other symptoms of depression. Most teens respond openly when asked if they get upset or depressed easily and if they have ever felt like hurting themselves or someone else. Any positive responses can be pursued by asking the patient to “tell me about this.” It must be stressed that adolescents who are actively suicidal or homicidal require immediate intervention by mental health experts, legal authorities, or both.Recent exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus as well as to other contagious diseases such as hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis should be determined. Asking about pets, tick bites, recent travel, and water supply sometimes is fruitful. A search also should be made for symptoms of cardiac disorders, pulmonary conditions, endocrinopathies, gastrointestinal problems, and renal abnormalities. The menstrual history should be obtained from adolescent girls, looking for amenorrhea, irregular periods, or excessive bleeding, which may suggest the possibility of an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous miscarriage, recent termination, or threatened abortion. In addition, the patients should be asked about the use of any over-the-counter or prescribed medications that have a known sedative effect.The clinician also should inquire about symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension, a condition that has been associated with unexplained fatigue in adolescents. Neurally mediated hypotension leads to symptoms after prolonged periods of upright posture, standing in place, standing in the shower, and even sitting. It is especially common when the patient is in a warm environment and after emotionally stressful events. In addition, it may be seen immediately after exercise or soon after eating in some patients as blood flow is shifted to the intestines during the process of digestion.Common symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension include recurrent light-headedness and fainting, which often are associated with postexertional fatigue for 24 to 72 hours. Of particular note, persistent fatigue is a prominent feature of this condition in many adolescents, even if there is no history of fainting. In addition, headaches, myalgias, and mental confusion may occur. The latter frequently is described by patients as being in a “mental fog,” with difficulty concentrating, trouble paying attention, having a hard time staying on task, and having problems finding the right words. Occasionally, shortness of breath with or without chest pain may occur.Any history of recurrent or persistent fever should be documented in the clinician’s office. Unexplained temperature elevation suggests the presence of an underlying infection, neoplasm, or other inflammatory process such as Crohn disease. Hypothermia occurs frequently in patients who have experienced rapid or excessive weight loss. This finding is especially common among adolescents who have eating disorders in whom the low body temperature helps to conserve energy to help compensate for losses from severe caloric deprivation or purging. In addition, hypothyroidism always should be suspected in teenagers who are fatigued, whose temperatures tend to run below normal, and who gain weight in spite of what appear to be appropriate restrictions in dietary intake.Anxiety and stress are the most common causes of tachycardia in the practitioner’s office. They also are important sources of fatigue in adolescents, especially in patients who are not sleeping well. Marijuana is another frequent cause of tachycardia and should be considered in teenagers who appear to be excessively tired or poorly motivated. Stimulant drugs that have been prescribed, purchased over-the-counter, or taken illegally may cause an accelerated heart rate. Fatigue is relatively common when the effects of these drugs begin to wear off. Endocrine abnormalities, including Addison disease, diabetes mellitus, and hyperthyroidism, as well as a number of pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions may cause an elevated pulse rate in patients who are fatigued.Significant weight loss from voluntary caloric restriction is characteristically accompanied by sinus bradycardia, especially in patients who are hypothermic. This is an important physical finding that may help to distinguish adolescents who have eating disorders or those who are simply getting in shape from those who have an underlying organic cause for their weight loss. On the other hand, unexplained weight gain in patients who have bradycardia and fatigue should raise the suspicion of hypothyroidism. A slow pulse rate also may be caused by various medications or street drugs that have a known sedative effect.Abnormalities in the respiratory rate in association with fatigue may indicate a cardiac, pulmonary, or metabolic disorder. Variations in the breathing pattern also may be seen with the use, abuse, or withdrawal of many prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or street drugs.As with tachycardia, anxiety and stress are the most common causes of hypertension identified in the examination room. However, the finding of elevated blood pressure in association with fatigue may be due to several important medical conditions, including connective tissue disorders, Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, hyperthyroidism, and renal abnormalities. Routine use, abuse, or withdrawal of over-the-counter drugs, prescription medications, or illicit psychoactive substances also may cause hypertension and fatigue.Delayed orthostatic hypotension after prolonged standing also has been described in patients who have unexplained fatigue (discussed in greater detail later in this article). Hypotension also may be noted as an adverse effect of various medications or in relation to abuse of street drugs. Adolescents who have Addison disease are especially susceptible to dehydration with hypotension and cardiovascular collapse, particularly during periods of physical stress. Addison disease always should be suspected in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially when there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss.It is very important to plot height routinely throughout the adolescent years. Failure of a patient to progress along the expected parameters should draw immediate attention to the possibility of an underlying systemic process affecting growth and causing unexplained fatigue. In contrast, a normal linear growth velocity all but excludes the presence of an underlying endocrinopathy, such as hypothyroidism or Cushing syndrome, which may cause fatigue in association with obesity. A normal linear growth velocity also lessens the possibility of chronic cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or renal disorders in teenagers who are excessively tired.It is also very important to plot weight throughout adolescence. Patients who have excessive weight gain or loss should be evaluated carefully for the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or medical condition. Poor weight gain over time also may be a subtle manifestation of a serious underlying illness, such as inflammatory bowel disease, especially in adolescents who have an unexplained low energy level.The examiner’s first impression about the patient’s overall well-being can be very insightful. Does the patient look ill or well? Does the patient seem to be depressed, anxious, or stressed? Does the patient seem to be adequately nourished?The skin may serve as a window to underlying systemic causes of fatigue in adolescents. Jaundice suggests the presence of hepatitis or hemolysis. A yellow cast to the skin due to hypercarotenemia may be seen in patients who have anorexia nervosa and ingest large amounts of yellow-orange fruits and vegetables. This is a benign physical finding that resembles icterus, but the sclera are not involved. It should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of an eating disorder that may be otherwise unrecognized.Cyanosis may indicate the presence of a significant abnormality in the cardiovascular or pulmonary system, especially when digital clubbing also is present. The findings may be extremely subtle and only detectable by meticulous examination. A patient of mine had a somewhat sallow appearance. He was tired all the time, but was otherwise totally asymptomatic. During the consultation, he had bounding pulses that eventually led to the diagnosis of a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation as the cause of symptoms.Pallor usually is associated with iron deficiency anemia resulting from inadequate dietary intake, rapid growth, or blood loss. The latter is especially common in adolescent girls who are having heavy menstrual periods. However, many other important causes of anemia must be considered in this age group, including chronic inflammation, hemolysis, malignancy, and vitamin B12 deficiency, the latter especially in those who are on a vegan diet. Fatigue is a relatively late manifestation of anemia and usually is noted only in moderate-to-severe anemia that has developed over time. Pallor also may be a sign of anxiety, abuse of psychoactive drugs, and the allergic tension fatigue syndrome.Generalized hyperpigmentation may be seen in patients who have fatigue associated with Addison disease. A clue to this diagnosis is involvement of the unexposed areas of skin as well as accentuation of the hyperpigmentation over the axillae, nipples, umbilicus, genitalia, or extensor surfaces of the joints. The clinician also should look carefully at the dorsum of the hands for evidence of superficial ulcerations, calluses, or scars in patients who have bulimia. This is known as Russell sign and is caused by using the fingers to induce vomiting in an effort to control weight. Many patients who have bulimia suffer from fatigue because of fluid or electrolyte imbalance as well as associated depression. Other signs of self-mutilation, such as cuts, scars, scratches, burns, and carved-out tatoos, may be seen in patients suffering from anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem.A number of skin findings may provide insight into the presence of an underlying connective tissue disease, infectious process, or other inflammatory condition that could cause fatigue in adolescents. A butterfly or discoid rash and photosensitivity are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Flushed cheeks followed by the appearance of a lacy, reticulated rash over the trunk and extremities are found in Fifth disease, which may cause persistent fatigue in teenagers. An evanescent, salmon-colored rash that has irregular borders or serpiginous margins is seen in patients who have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and frequently is accompanied by fever. Subcutaneous nodules also may occur with this condition and are located near the olecranon process, on the dorsal aspect of the hands or knees, near the ears, and over pressure areas such as the scapulae, sacrum, buttocks, and heels. These nodules are usually nontender. In contrast, erythema nodosum is characterized by exquisitely tender, erythematous nodular lesions over the extensor surfaces of the extremities, especially on the pretibial surface of the legs. These lesions frequently recur and are associated with many inflammatory disorders that cause fatigue.Raynaud phenomenon, with characteristic color changes of the fingers and toes, should raise suspicion of a connective tissue disease or other underlying cause. Nailbed capillary changes with dilation and tortuosity of the vessels may be a very subtle finding in patients who have collagen vascular diseases. Cutaneous sclerosis, especially of the digits and face, is associated with scleroderma. In addition, an erythematous, purplish discoloration of the eyelids, forehead, cheeks, temples, dorsal interphalangeal joints, and extensor surfaces of the extremities suggests dermatomyositis.The presence of “allergic shiners” or a bluish discoloration under the eyes often is seen with sinusitis as well as with the allergic tension fatigue syndrome. Injection of the bulbar conjunctivae is common among those who use marijuana. Sjögren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder of unknown cause characterized by dry eyes, xerostomia, salivary gland enlargement, and a high incidence of connective tissue disease. Evidence of iritis or uveitis suggests the presence of a connective tissue disorder or other underlying inflammatory process, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Several oral findings have been noted in patients who have eating disorders, including enamel erosion or caries, particularly over the inner aspect of the upper teeth. This finding probably is related to repeated exposure to gastric contents following self-induced vomiting. Swelling of the parotid and submandibular salivary glands also has been described in those who have bulimia. Enlargement of the submandibular glands may be especially difficult to distinguish from lymphadenopathy in the anterior cervical region. In most instances, the salivary tissue has a softer consistency than the enlarged nodes, but there may be considerable overlap. Infection or other causes of inflammation in the salivary glands also may be associated with fatigue.Evidence of stomatitis, gingivitis, or glossitis in teenagers who are excessively tired may indicate an underlying systemic process. Recurrent mouth ulcers, especially if they are unusually severe or recalcitrant to therapy, are relatively common in Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Behçet syndrome is a rare multisystem vasculitis characterized by the triad of recurrent oral ulcers, iridocyclitis, and recurrent ulcers of the external genitalia as well as a variety of other findings that may be accompanied by fatigue. In addition, hyperpigmentation of the gums is seen with Addison disease.The adolescent’s strength should be assessed to differentiate conditions that are associated with muscular weakness from other causes of fatigue. Muscular dystrophy always must be considered. Patients who have myasthenia gravis often experience weakness only late in the day or after physical activity. The clinician should search for other signs of myasthenia gravis that sometimes are subtle, including evidence of ptosis, weakness of the extraocular muscles, and dysphagia. The diminished strength noted in dermatomyositis may be generalized, but it is predominantly proximal, with involvement of the limb girdles and anterior flexors.Objective evidence of arthritis strongly supports an organic cause for the fatigue, such as connective tissue disease, inflammatory bowel disease, infection, or neoplasm. Localized bone pain or tenderness to direct palpation may be associated with anatomic lesions, both benign and malignant. Unexplained bone pain that awakens the patient at night is especially concerning for leukemia or similar invasive processes. Clubbing of the fingers or toes suggests the possibility of chronic pulmonary, cardiac, or liver disease.A careful neurologic examination should be performed to help exclude rare causes of fatigue in adolescents, such as multiple sclerosis. The Chiari malformation also may be associated with subtle neurologic signs in association with fatigue. I recently had a patient in whom the cerebellar tonsils protruded into the spinal canal and compressed the nerves innervating the palate. The floppy palatal tissue resulted in obstructive sleep apnea, and the patient awakened unrefreshed in the morning. The family sought medical attention after the teachers complained that the girl had been falling asleep in class. A decompression procedure was performed by neurosurgery, and the girl’s fatigue resolved completely.Facial tenderness suggests the presence of sinusitis, although this finding often is absent in this condition. Persistent lymphadenopathy may be seen with infection, malignancy, connective tissue disease, or other inflammatory processes. The thyroid gland should be palpated for any enlargement or nodules. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism may be associated with fatigue. The lungs, heart, and abdomen should be assessed carefully for any abnormalities that may provide a clue to the diagnosis. The costovertebral angles should be palpated for any tenderness that may suggest pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, or other renal abnormality. In addition, patients who have generalized ligamentous laxity frequently experience vague musculoskeletal pain and are tired, especially late in the day. Finally, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered in adolescent girls and a pelvic examination performed when indicated.The differential diagnosis of fatigue is extensive and includes numerous organic disorders as well as many psychosocial-medical conditions (Table 2). Sometimes a combination of factors contributes to the fatigue, especially when it is unduly prolonged. It is relatively common for an initial medical illness to take on features of a psychiatric condition as the process evolves. Psychologic issues may emerge as the primary agenda or develop as a consequence of an organic illness. A psychiatric diagnosis should not be assigned solely by the process of exclusion; the appropriate diagnostic criteria must be met before such a diagnosis is made.Symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression may be especially difficult to sort out in adolescents who are fatigued. Failure to attend school may compound an already difficult situation by perpetuating progressive absenteeism. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility that masked school avoidance may be contributing to the fatigue. The hyperventilation syndrome may present with fatigue in association with difficulty breathing, chest pain, lightheadedness, headaches, abdominal pain, and numbness or tingling of the extremities. In addition, fatigue may be a sign of certain eating disorders, especially bulimia and obesity, which frequently are accompanied by poor self-esteem, feelings of guilt, and depression. Patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa typically do not tire easily unless they are moribund or the weight loss has been rapid.Clinicians always should consider the possibility of Addison disease in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially if there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. There usually is generalized hyperpigmentation with involvement of unexposed surfaces as well as accentuation in areas of predilection, as described earlier. Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia are useful diagnostic features, but are not always present. The most definitive diagnostic test is the ACTH stimulation test (described later). It is imperative to consider Addison disease in the differential diagnosis because if it is not recognized and treated, an adrenal crisis may supervene.Many adolescents who have unexplained fatigue begin with a “mono-like” illness that never resolves completely, and all diagnostic testing results are negative. As with acute infectious mononucleosis, these patients often have a history of severe sore throat, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, headaches, nausea, myalgia, and arthralgia with or without evidence of arthritis. Many of the symptoms recur or linger for months in association with the fatigue. In addition, whenever a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is being entertained, the clinician should consider the possibility of infection with Toxoplasma gondii or cytomegalovirus, which may cause similar symptoms.The association between orthostatic blood pressure changes and prolonged fatigue was described by Streeten and Anderson in 1992, who studied seven patients who had lightheadedness, fatigue, “weakness,” and sometimes syncope. Blood pressures were measured every minute with an automated oscillometer while the patients remained standing. There was no fall in blood pressure after standing for a few minutes, which is the endpoint in traditional testing. However, there was a severe fall in blood pressure in all patients after they stood for 13 to 30 minutes, often with syncope or presyncope. Rowe and associates later described four adolescents who had a history of fatigue and underwent tilt-table testing. This procedure induced significant hypotension in all after they were tilted upright for 12 to 23 minutes. Their fatigue improved dramatically after they were treated for orthostatic hypotension.It is not known why patients who have prolonged fatigue develop these cardiovascular changes when they assume the upright posture. When normal individuals stand up, blood pools in the legs, catecholamines increase to compensate for the decreased venous return to the heart, and there is a compensatory increase in heart rate that involves more vigorous contractions. The reduced amount of blood flow to the heart is pumped more efficiently to the vital organs, especially the brain. In contrast, when individuals who have neurally mediated hypotension stand up, there appears to be a “miscommunication” between the heart and the brain. The heart rate slows while the vessels in the arms and legs dilate. As a result, even more blood is taken from the brain, and the patients feel faint. Finally, an abnormal increase in heart rate after prolonged standing has been described in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue. This condition is known as delayed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and it may occur with or without hypotension.In many instances, no diagnostic studies are required after a thorough history and careful physical examination. The costs of investigative studies are high, and any unnecessary testing should be avoided unless specifically indicated. However, if the diagnosis remains uncertain, the clinician should consider a screening evaluation that includes the baseline tests shown in Table 3.The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum electrolytes, liver profile, and urinalysis allow rapid assessment of target organ status in response to a systemic illness. Rheumatologic studies help exclude systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases that may present with fatigue. Thyroid studies always should be performed because manifestations of thyroid conditions often are subtle early in the course of the illness. A high morning cortisol level goes against a diagnosis of Addison disease, but the ACTH stimulation test is the definitive test to exclude this condition. In normal individuals, the serum cortisol level increases two- to three-fold 1 hour after intravenous administration of a synthetic ACTH prepa",

      "title": "Non‐ulcer dyspepsia: myths and realities",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

Large scale natural disasters that involve large numbers of people not only affect the mental health of victims, but also workers who carry out rescue and recovery tasks. Flashbacks restore emotions associated with traumatic events and make people very uncomfortable. PTSD has a large impact on individuals and society. There is evidence to suggest that, among anxiety disorders, PTSD is one of the most strongly associated with suicidal behavior.

      "title": "Exercise for chronic musculoskeletal pain: A biopsychosocial approach",
      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) refers to ongoing pain felt in the bones, joints and tissues of the body that persists longer than 3 months. For these conditions, it is widely accepted that secondary pathologies or the consequences of persistent pain, including fear of movement, pain catastrophizing, anxiety and nervous system sensitization appear to be the main contributors to pain and disability. While exercise is a primary treatment modality for CMP, the intent is often to improve physical function with less attention to secondary pathologies. Exercise interventions for CMP which address secondary pathologies align with contemporary pain rehabilitation practices and have greater potential to improve patient outcomes above exercise alone. Biopsychosocial treatment which acknowledges and addresses the biological, psychological and social contributions to pain and disability is currently seen as the most efficacious approach to chronic pain. This clinical update discusses key aspects of a biopsychosocial approach concerning exercise prescription for CMP and considers both patient needs and clinician competencies. There is consensus for individualized, supervised exercise based on patient presentation, goals and preference that is perceived as safe and non‐threatening to avoid fostering unhelpful associations between physical activity and pain. The weight of evidence supporting exercise for CMP has been provided by aerobic and resistance exercise studies, although there is considerable uncertainty on how to best apply the findings to exercise prescription. In this clinical update, we also provide evidence‐based guidance on exercise prescription for CMP through a synthesis of published work within the field of exercise and CMP rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is suggested that psychotherapeutic treatment during pregnancy can help a disturbed woman achieve better integration of internal resources and self-representations, thereby preventing postnatal maternal distress. The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

      "abstract": "The current chapter examines the associations between psychopathy and its subcomponents and various features of emotion regulation (ER). Overall, there is a significant association between psychopathy and ER difficulties. These difficulties are likely to span across several overlapping ER domains, including emotional non-acceptance, poor emotional awareness and clarity, access to limited repertoire of effective ER strategies, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior when upset (i.e., poor distress tolerance), and difficulties inhibiting impulsive behavior under emotional arousal (i.e., negative urgency). This pattern seems generally consistent with historical and contemporary conceptualizations of psychopathy. More overt features of psychopathy (i.e., behavioral) are strongly related to emotion dysregulation, also in line with the different contemporary perspectives reviewed earlier. More recent research has extended beyond theoretical expectations by showing that the ER disturbances linked to psychopathy are widespread and not limited to specific ER components, and also that these disturbances are not merely the reflection of general externalizing psychopathology or negative emotionality.",

Diagnosis is made basically on somatic symptoms, the most important ones being chronic fatigue, chronic pain, chronic sleep disorder, chronic gastrointestinal disturbance, and dysphoria. Other illnesses that might be present instead of or in addition to depression should be sought, both before depression therapy is started and also in the face of persistent symptoms after treatment is started. Basic treatment is with antidepressant medications, with careful attention to selection of drug and dosage, and careful monitoring for adverse effects. Antidepressant therapy and any other applicable forms of therapy are not mutually exclusive, and any other means of improving the patient's overall situation should be vigorously sought.",

My disabilities after the strokes lay not only in the mechanical execution of commands and the ability of contraction of muscles, but also in mental processes like perception, attention, memory, and thought. These impediments have meant drastic changes in my living conditions and social status. My disability was multifaceted and involved my whole person. Its expression was somatic, psychic, and behavioural. I suffered from loss of appetite, disturbance of sleep, psychic anxiety, depression, anguish, aggressive reactions, communication difficulties, disorganization of conduct, and so on. My personality no longer matched up to my own expectations. I was trapped in a situation of impossibility of living, despair, and hopelessness. I was confronted with a problem I could not circumvent, and I had insufficient skills available to solve it. I had fallen into a state of nothingness. My life was in crisis.",

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

PTSD has not been demonstrated to represent a unified construct such as that established for other validated psychiatric disorders identified in this text, but a developing knowledge base for PTSD is promising for future validation of this diagnosis. PTSD is an unusual diagnosis because of the conditional nature of this disorder that requires exposure to a traumatic event for consideration of the diagnosis. Individuals who have not been exposed to a traumatic event cannot meet criteria for PTSD. This feature of PTSD has created difficulties in applying this diagnosis in both clinical and research settings.",

With the acceleration of modern life rhythm and the increase of the social competition pressure, emotional stress has become an important cause for the spread of Shanghuo symptoms. What's more, Shanghuo can impact the body physiological functions to cause the onset, recurrence and progression of common diseases, harming the health of the body. According to the long-term research findings, the author found that Shanghuo referred to the imbalance of multiple physiological functions, such as nerve, immunity and metabolism, caused by emotional stress. \"Shanghuo\" is not a disease itself, but it can increase the susceptibility to a variety of diseases. This study reviewed the traditional medicine theory and the modern medical studies, and explored the relevance and correlation mechanisms between the Shanghuo symptoms and disease susceptibility, so as to provide a reference to improve the state of sub-health and prevent or treat modern diseases.",

Psychosomatic factors should be given special attention during interviews. For a correct picture to be obtained, the help of a specially trained worker i.e. a psychiatrist or psychologist, should be enlisted. Factors and casual relationships can then be uncovered which remain problems to doctors not thus specialized. The two series dealt with in this study illustrate this clearly. Summarizing the observations made, Menière patients subjected to careful psychic and somatic analysis are found to have a predisposing psychosomatic constitution which, under chronic or acute stress, leads to such somatic manifestations as, in their turn, seem to presuppose a certain somatic predisposition—in this particular case evidently in the ear. Chronic stress seems to impair prognosis, a fact not difficult to understand considering that the mode of reaction depends upon the constitution, which—obviously—is of fairly permanent nature.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in positive psychology underscore the potential benefit of focusing on resilience factors rather than psychiatric illness or symptoms. Resilience can be defined as a set of qualities that can be multidimensional and enable an individual to persevere through adversity. Both internal and external stressors are constant in a person’s life and one’s ability to cope affects their resilience. Sometimes, one’s ability to cope is unsuccessful and can result in self-destructive behaviors. Obtaining information on risk factors is important in identifying personal and environmental issues that contribute to self-destructive behaviors. These behaviors have been described as wide-ranging acts of harm to self, including suicidal behaviors, nonsuicidal self-injury, and recklessness. Direct and indirect subtypes of self-destructive behaviors are important to understand and will be explored. Past and childhood trauma is known to be a strong predictor of self-harming behavior into adulthood. Further, post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses are strongly correlated with prevalence of suicide attempts. The literature indicates that other risk factors include psychiatric illness, socioeconomic disadvantages, early and late adulthood, sexual orientation, and military/veteran status. Additionally, self-harming behavior is a predictor for suicide attempts, with a suicide completion rate of 5% for up to 9 years after hospitalization for self-harm. Research shows that adolescents, military/veteran, and ethnically and sexually diverse populations are most at risk. Several cultural aspects within these groups will be explored to show potential protective factors which can be applied to the individual. It is important to understand the factors that relate to resilience in dealing with negative effects of trauma and stress, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental illness. Successful evidence-based resilience programs within each of these at-risk groups will be discussed along with implications for further research.",

Die Ursache, weshalb Unfallfolgen psychischer Art haeufig zu Rechtsstreitigkeiten fuehren, liegen darin, dass psychische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden und mitunter kaum zu objektivieren sind. Diese Ausgangslage erfordert zunaechst, dass zwischen einem seelischen Primaerschaden und einem seelischen Folgeschaden zu unterscheiden ist.

In settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, the rate of malingering may be as high as 30%, but its frequency in clinical practice is not known. We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

No siempre las definiciones y descripciones de los trastornos depresivos distinguen entre trastornos depresivos de estados de animo no patologico. Si la sintomatologia depresiva aparece como una respuesta a un evento de la vida como el duelo, un diagnostico de depresion puede no ser claro ya que estas reacciones representan reacciones normales y probablemente adaptacion a esas circunstancias de la vida. El reto a enfrentar es distinguir reacciones emocionales normales a eventos cotidianos de un conjunto de enfermedades psiquiatricas caracterizadas por la presencia de tristeza. Algunos estudios recientes de investigacion senalan algunos de los correlatos neurobiologicos entre tristeza y depresion. Este trabajo repasa una nueva evidencia de la necesidad de distinguir la tristeza de la depresion clinica, con una vision diferente. La cuestion es no solo la diversa calidad del episodio de depresion o del depresivo y los sintomas asociados a la misma; sino que tambien el presente estudio considera el valor adaptativo de la tristeza y sentimientos relacionados que afecta a casos clinicos especificos. La tristeza tiene algunos aspectos positivos y por lo tanto un valor adaptativo; aumenta la capacidad para resolver problemas relacionados con las perdidas y danos, la tristeza tambien nos ayuda a comunicar nuestra vulnerabilidad y a veces necesita, evitar las agresiones en los conflictos jerarquicos y modula las intervenciones que llevan a recuperar vinculos perdidos. La respuesta a las preguntas implicadas en este problema tendra un impacto en la manera de que la Psiquiatria sera concebida, practicada y financiada en un futuro cercano.

Definitions and descriptions of depressive disorders do not always distinguish between depressive disorders from nonpathological mood states. If depressive symptomatology appears as a response to a life event such as bereavement, a diagnosis of depression may not be clear since these reactions represent normal and presumably adaptive reactions to such life circumstances. The challenge to face is to distinguish normal emotional reactions to everyday events from a set of psychiatric illnesses characterised by the presence of sadness. Some recent research studies point out some of the neurobiological correlates between sorrow and depression. This paper reviews new evidence for the need to distinguish sadness from clinical depression, supporting a different view. The issue is not only the different quality of depression or depressive episode and the symptoms associated to it, the present study also considered the adaptive value of sadness and related affects in general in specific clinical cases. Sadness has some positive functions and therefore an adaptive value; it increases the ability to solve challenges related to losses and harms, sadness also helps us to communicate our vulnerability and needs, sometimes avoid aggressions in hierarchical conflicts and modulates interventions that lead to recover from lost bonds. The answer to the questions involved in this problem will have an impact on the way psychiatry will be conceived, practiced and financed in the near future",

It is of equal importance compared with others in the 21st century. Stress management is a common phenomenon globally. The imbalance of any occasion creates stress. The most significant factors include separated from family, loneliness, fatigue, multi-nationality, limited recreation activity, and dissatisfaction of job opportunity, which tends to cause healthcare issues, especially sleep deprivation and depression. The long-lasting stress causes chronic mental fatigue. It has positive and negative impacts, which depend on situations. Sometimes it plays as a motivating factor for peak performance and great opportunity, or sometimes negative like when a person faces social, physical, organizational, and emotional problems.",

Postconcussion syndrome is defined as the persistence of these symptoms beyond 3 months. These initial symptoms can be debilitating and can lead to further physiological or psychological impairments such as depression, slowed processing speed, and gait imbalances. Although pharmacological interventions with antidepressants and stimulants may be useful, some patients may not accept or adequately respond to these interventions. A nonpharmacological approach to treating postconcussion syndrome uses a holistic approach to treat both the mind and body. Nonprescription therapies include vestibular rehabilitation for dizziness, vertigo, and balance/gait difficulties, as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy for both somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The timing and ratio of rest versus rehabilitation through activity is case specific and a matter of ongoing clinical judgment given the uniqueness of each injury and the variety of postconcussive presentations.

Mental trauma or psychological injury has been underdiagnosed as a basis for litigation, and attorneys often overlook the need to screen accident victims and family members. Clinical data reveal that it is not conclusive to extrapolate findings related to grief to a particular drowning event. Grief is emotional, is often an unknown reaction, and it does not always make sense. As an individual experiences grief, dwelling on what has been lost is part of the normal process. The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult. This is an assessment conducted by a neuropsychologist or a trained skill psychometrist. Neuropsychological evaluations document patterns of strengths and weakness among cognitive and behavioral functions, behavioral alterations, and cognitive changes resulting from a central nervous system (CNS) disease or injury.",

The pattern was of mild but typical depressive symptoms. Residual symptoms were more common in subjects with more severe initial illness, but were not related to any other predictors, including longer prior illness, dysthymia, or lower dose of drug treatment during the illness episode. There were weak associations with personality that might have been consequences of symptom presence. Residual symptoms were very strong predictors of subsequent early relapse, which occurred in 76% (13/17) of those with residual symptoms and 25% (10/40) of those without.",

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

It is not clear whether the different case definitions have different implications for aetiology or prognosis. Paediatric CFS/ME is defined in the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidelines as \"generalised fatigue persisting after routine tests and investigations have failed to identify an obvious underlying cause\".8 The NICE recommended that the fatigue should have lasted 3 months before a diagnosis is made and highlighted the fact that the fatigue must be disabling and was likely to occur in the presence of one other symptom7 (box 1). There is a philosophical discussion to be had on how diagnoses are made, particularly with diagnoses where no underlying pathogen has been identified, but it can be argued that \"delineation of a syndrome is the first step towards elucidation of the chain of causation and redefinition of the whole group or subgroups within it\".9 Box 1 ### Definitions for chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in children and young people Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health definition of chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2007 guidelines7",

Further studies of PMS in all areas--etiology, pathobiology, diagnosis, course of illness, and treatment efficacy--are needed to increase the body of information about the menstrual cycle's effects on women's health and mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "Regressive behavior is a known sequela after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, prolonged “infantile-like” behavior has received little attention in the literature, suggesting that this is a rare phenomenon. It is typically characterized by long-lasting childish, extremely dependent, and sometimes aggressive behavior, which is distinguished from the expected recovery process. The relevant theoretical framework lies in the field of disorders called “Neuropathologies of the self” (NPS). We report three cases of young adults who, following a severe TBI, developed continual regressive behavior. The Disability Rating Scale (DRS) was used to assess possible change in their condition. First, while admitted, which was performed in retrospect, and again 6 years later at the time stated. Inter-rater reliability for the scale items showed adequate correlation. Results showed no significant difference in patients’ scores, indicating persistent functional difficulties. We conclude that this “regressive syndrome” presents an unusual form of behavior that is stable over time. It seems to be in line with other NPS disorders, and may stem from an interaction of organic factors and primary mental complexity. Nevertheless, further research is required to examine the factors affecting the emergence and recovery from this phenomenon.",

      "title": "Defining Mental Health in Later Life",
      "abstract": "Although mental health has traditionally received little attention other than as the absence of mental illness, lifespan psychology has recently generated research that enlightens us about the factors that constitute psychological well-being. Similarly, recent evidence about the preventive benefits of wellness and successful aging have renewed attention on the importance of defining mental health-even though the mental health service-delivery network in the western world is based on a medical model that only addresses illness and disorder. TRADITIONAL MODELS FOR DEFINING MENTAL HEALTH Traditional models for defining mental health include approaches and core constructs that also can be applied to studies of well-being. Statistical definitions of mental health use comparisons between individuals to identify people whose functioning falls at the outer ends of the theoretical bell curve of normative data. For instance, on a characteristic such as mood, people experiencing levels at the highest or lowest extremes would be considered abnormal (e.g., manic or depressed), while those falling in the middle would be considered normal according to a definition that equates normative with normal. Obvious problems arise with this definition, as certain characteristics (e.g., cognitive functioning) are abnormal only in one direction, and other characteristics do not lend themselves to this kind of statistical approach at all (e.g., vitality). A symptom-based definition of mental health is the underpinning of the current diagnostic system used by mental health practitioners and policy makers. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) defines mental disorders and syndromes in terms of clusters of symptoms that often coexist in particular constellations or patterns and that impair a person's day-to-day functioning or cause personal distress. Within this approach, mental health is defined primarily by the absence of symptoms known to impair functioning. Again, obvious problems arise within this approach, as certain people may be symptom-free but not viewed by others as mentally healthy (e.g., a sociopath, defined as such because of behavior). Moral or spiritual approaches to psychosocial functioning continue to influence definitions of mental health and illness. Such definitions are used in more traditional cultures and subcultures to focus on prosocial characteristics that are considered evidence of mental health. The notion that the spiritual world influences behavior both positively and negatively remains evident in dominant western culture. In addition, many ethnic groups rely on such frameworks for their primary understanding of how to interpret and influence behavior. Cultural differences in relying on spiritual beliefs to define mental well-being or mental problems are a clear challenge to this approach. Subjective distress is commonly used to partially determine the presence or absence of mental health and disorders. The DSM-IV includes subjective distress as one outcome alternative that could lead to the determination that symptom patterns are sufficiently intense to warrant diagnosis. Heavy reliance on subjective criteria as a major indicator of well-being may be of concern, however, because of humans' capacity to adapt to a variety of adverse conditions and consider them normal (Baltes and Baltes, 1990). Furthermore, many people with significant disorders do not recognize themselves to be distressed (e.g., pedophiles and others with personality disorders). Each of these approaches offers a meaningful contribution to definitions of mental health and disorder, and, together, the approaches have furthered efforts of the past two decades to develop a useful nomenclature for mental disorder. However, these approaches are less useful for efforts to define mental health. NEW DIRECTIONs FROM LIFESPAN PSYCHOLOGY Recent discussions about theory and data in the lifespan psychology literature provide yet another set of frameworks for formulating a definition for mental health in later life. …",

      "title": "Paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of recovery",
      "abstract": "Bell’s palsy (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy of the facial nerve) is an acute, usually unilateral paralysis of facial muscles. This disorder had been described and studied by Sir Charles Bell in 1836. In majority of Bell’s palsy cases the patient achieves full spontaneous recovery within 3-5 weeks even without treatment. In about 15-30% of cases the recovery takes considerably longer time (3 to 6 months, sometimes longer) and is usually incomplete. After the incomplete recovery of Bell’s palsy some residuals and complications usually develop. Those can include weakness of facial muscles, facial asymmetry in both neutral expression and with facial movements, pathological synkinesis, contractures of facial muscles, crocodile tears, facial pains etc.\r\n The above-mentioned complications may result in disfigured face with various degrees of severity, involuntary facial movements during speech and emotions, facial pains that are difficult to relieve with pain-killers, inability to adequately express emotions. All the named manifestations can have a dramatic impact on individual’s self-esteem, social contacts and general quality of life. They may lead to stress, depression, self-isolation and in some extreme cases – to suicidal behavior.\r\nCustomary treatment for acute Bell’s palsy include prednisone, antiviral medications, eye care to prevent drying of the cornea, mime-therapy (neuromuscular retraining). Sometimes acupuncture, chiropractors, laser therapy or high doses of B-vitamins are used. In some countries such controversial interventions as electrical stimulation (shocks) and massage with ice-cubes are being used as treatment modalities for acute Bell’s palsy. If the facial condition does not considerably improve within the first year, then the choice of treatments for residuals and complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy is rather limited. It includes continuation of mime-therapy, periodic injections of botulinum toxin, and in some exceptional cases surgical interventions (nerve graft, muscle transposition etc.) Facial nerve decompression has not been proven to be effective as Bell’s palsy treatment and therefore is nowadays seldom used. Long-standing Bell’s palsy patients are left with very limited choice of treatments for their residuals and complications. In the medical world and among rehabilitation specialists it is considered that if Bell’s palsy had not recovered within first 1-2 years and if complications had formed, then the patient will retain the developed synkinesis, contractures, related facial pains and other manifestations for the rest of his or her life.\r\nIn the recent years there has not been much research done of the underlying causes for the complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy. Without thorough understanding of such causes it is rather challenging to compose proper rehabilitation programs that deliver the desired improvements in facial symmetry and respectively, in patient’s quality of life.\r\nIn this article we discuss the traditional approach to possible causes, available treatments of Bell’s palsy complications and share our concept of a new paradigm in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of the recovery (2 years and more). According to this new paradigm, synkinesis, contractures and mass movements of facial muscles, as well as related chronic facial pains are the result of newly-formed, pathological mimetic patterns in the CNS, which can be reduced and then reversed by applying the new approach to rehabilitation, based on other than traditional principles. The results achieved by our patients can serve as an evidence that this new approach may indicate a beginning of a paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy.",

Individual anxiety disorders have considerable symptomatic overlap in their expression. The life-time prevalence of all anxiety disorders in the general population is about 25%. There is familial aggregation of anxiety and mood disorders such as major depression. Genetic factors and life experiences both contribute to the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders. GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and uncontrollable worry, is present for longer than 6 months, and tends to occur comorbidly with other conditions, including other anxiety disorders and major depression as well as general medical conditions. GAD, given its chronic nature, is associated with significant impairment. GAD is responsive to pharmacological treatments, such as anxiolytics and antidepressants, as well as psychotherapies such as cognitive therapy.",

      "title": "Treatment options for situational anxiety in the neurology physician practice",
      "abstract": "Recent decades have been characterized by high stress levels, which inevitably leads to neuroticism and psychopathization of the population. Emotional stress and the anxiety that follows it can be the cause and provocateur of some pathological processes and diseases. Unlike normal anxiety, intended to adapt the body, protect it and preserve life, pathological anxiety is inadequate to the intensity of the threat, is long-lasting, severe, and disrupts the quality of a person’s life and his activities. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis caused by stress leads to the development of psycho-vegetative syndrome – a complex of somatic, vegetative, and mental symptoms. However, in clinical practice, doctors usually encounter the fact that the patient more often presents various multisystem somatic complaints, ignoring emotional experiences. Undiagnosed anxiety can lead to chronicity or relapse of the disease, the prescription of only symptomatic therapy and aggravation of the course of the missed anxiety disorder. For a doctor to qualitatively assess the clinical picture, it is necessary to understand the structure of autonomic dysfunction in various systems and “recognize” the manifestations of anxiety. Managing such patients, especially comorbid ones, is a complex task, the solution of which will be most effective through joint efforts with psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, art therapy, music therapy, medications are an integral part of the therapy for this category of patients. Psychotropic drugs can reduce both anxiety and vegetative symptoms. For subclinical anxiety disorder with somatic manifestations, herbal sedatives or drugs based on them are used in outpatient practice, which have a favorable safety profile with sufficient effectiveness. The drug of choice may be Valocordin, which has sedative, antispasmodic, and hypnotic effects, which corresponds to the goals of treating psychovegetative syndrome.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment in elderly patients with schizophrenia: age related changes",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is a major feature of the illness. Like many of the other aspects of the illness, however, it has not been studied extensively in older patients. Several studies of older patients with a lifetime course of poor outcome and chronic institutional stay have indicated that some patients manifest evidence of profound cognitive impairments on a cross-sectional basis and cognitive and functional decline over longitudinal follow-ups of 30 months or longer. Risk factors for this decline include lower educational attainment and more severe positive symptoms, but do not include more severe symptoms of physical illness. These impairments have been shown to be discriminable from normal age-related changes and from the changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In contrast, studies of patients with no history of lifetime institutional stay find no such evidence of either age-related changes in cognitive functioning or longitudinal decline in cognitive or functional status. Since there is accumulating evidence of progressive brain changes over the lifespan in patients with schizophrenia, the course of cognitive deficits in later life will remain an important topic, both for understanding the lifetime course of schizophrenia and for developing interventions aimed at reduction of disability in the illness.",

With time, she became increasingly baffled by these episodes, trying to “figure out if the situation was causing guilt” (Supplamentary Table 1). These episodes were noted by the patient to be more frequent in social-affective situations, such as standing in front of large groups or arguing with her parents.",

      "title": "Tackling anxiety and depression in older people in primary care.",
      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that anxiety and depression are less common in older than younger adults. One in ten people aged > or = 65 fulfils the diagnostic criteria for at least one common mental disorder. Older depressed patients have an increased risk of both cardiac and all-cause mortality. Both anxiety and depression in older patients are often unrecognised and untreated, and have a poor prognosis. There is a progressive decline in the prevalence of common mental disorders above the age of 55. Anxiety and depression often occur together, and share many risk factors. However, anxiety tends to follow threats or traumatic events, whereas depression follows loss events. Chronic diseases, cognitive impairment, pain and functional disability are risk factors for the onset of depression, but not anxiety. Depression is between two and three times more common among those with a chronic physical health problem. Even patients with major depression often remain unrecognised and untreated. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is by far the most common anxiety disorder in older people but most GAD patients are not recognised in primary care and only a third of them receive any form of treatment. Older patients often deny feeling anxious or depressed and are more likely to present with insomnia, irritability, agitation and multiple somatic complaints. GPs may erroneously believe that depression is a normal reaction to the losses of old age, and may be reluctant to initiate treatment. A good case can be made for replacing the PHQ-9 with the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale which almost entirely avoids somatic questions. This is a screening not a diagnostic tool and does not evaluate symptom severity.",

In recent studies prevalence is at least 17% in primary care. Somatoform complaints (e.g. headache with 38.7%) or non-specific common symptoms (e.g. feeling of inner restlessness with 41.3%) are much more widespread. Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

      "title": "Maternal Depression, Mothering and Child Development",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

Treatment using a biopsychosocial model must focus on providing the individual with specific techniques designed to help increase feelings of control over-persistent and problematic symptoms. The research reviewed emphasized wide variability in patients' responses to pain and biomedical treatment as a likely outcome predicated by the individual's prior history with pain, their cognitive appraisals and behavioral coping responses, the social milieu in which the pain occurs, and the course of the pain pathophysiology. CP/CPPS should not be viewed from a restrictive biomedical model because pain is not a purely physical phenomenon, but rather a complex physical, emotional, and interpersonal fusion, where the negative outcomes are suggested to advance over time if left unchecked.",

      "abstract": "The essential feature of functional somatic syndromes is the presence of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network . This alternative approach is based on the fact that self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments.",

The direct and indirect consequences of stress and breakdown in adaptation also require evaluation not only from the general and occupational medicine viewpoint, but also sociologically.

The performance characteristics of the new criteria set are yet to be tested--a necessary next step to inform the discussions that will culminate in DSM-IV. The remaining areas of greatest controversy are whether (1) early onset, primary dysthymic disorder should be redefined as depressive personality and placed on Axis II; (2) \"double-depression\" represents a real clinical phenomenon or a definitional artifact; and (3) the content of the diagnostic criteria can be made more specific for chronic depressions.

      "title": "Molecular and Genetic Basis of Stress",
      "abstract": "A person’s reaction to trauma depends on the traumatic situation itself, personality characteristics of the person exposed to trauma, and posttraumatic social environment. Stressor must be extreme event that is extremely dangerous or fatal nature, and which is outside normal human experience [1]. Studies investigating psychological consequences of military and civil trauma confirmed the correlation between the nature and intensity of trauma, previous traumatic experience, and psychological consequences. Stress causes the autonomic nervous system hyperactivity. If the stress is extreme or constant symptoms of hyperactivity, increased heart rate, increased respiration, sweating, muscle tension, insomnia and increased anxiety are becoming significant for the prolonging the symptoms of PTSD. Our cells are well adapted to exposure to a mild stress for a short time. In contrast there are potentially serious consequences of exposure to the prolonged stress[2]. Various damages arising from the war in Bosnia (1992 - 1995) are almost undetectable, and the consequences for the mental health of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina are long and painful. It is estimated that in Bosnia and Herzegovina there are 1.75 million people who have some stress-related mental disorders, of which 1 million in the Federation. PTSD may be represented by mutations that must be carried by many genes. There may even be epigenetic reasons for the disorder that have nothing to do with heritable mutations per se. Epigenetic means related to functional changes in the genome that can be regulated by external environmental events that do not involve alterations in the genetic code. One epigenetic mechanism is called “methylation,” a molecular process that affects the activity of a large percentage of genes. Epigenetic investigations say that methylation may be involved in the development of stress regulation in early life[3]. A number of longitudinal studies have looked at independent variables spanning the entire course of the illness. A 10-year follow-up study in Holocaust survivors clearly demonstrated decline in stress hormone levels for those patients in whom PTSD developed or in whom PTSD was chronic. No such decline was shown for those survivors who did not present with PTSD. Indeed, they showed a relative increase in hormone levels [4]. Hippocampal volume has also been studied (using the same types of experiments as the twin studies described previously). Hippocampal volume can be quite variable. It can change as a result of environmental exposure, duration of certain illnesses, and even the age of the subject. As noted, shrunken hippocampal volume has been shown in PTSD patients, but most of these are younger cohorts. When one examines PTSD in older cohorts, the differences in volume evaporate, and no linkage with disease is observed [5]. Microarray analysis is a powerful way to look at global gene expression profiles in tissues which can identify relevant molecular processes. On that way we have enough tools on hand to find the genes responsible for the disorder. Studying such genes can lead to creating effective treatments, including designing medications that are not only specific to the disorder but also specific to an individual’s experience with the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

Quienes han pasado por circunstancias vitales adversas (desempleo, luto, traumatismos psicologicos) tienen mas probabilidades de sufrir depresion. A su vez puede generar mas estres y disfuncion, empeorar la situacion vital de la persona afectada. (OMS, 2017). La depresion puede llegar a hacerse cronica o recurrente y dificultar sensiblemente el desempeno en el trabajo o la escuela y la capacidad para afrontar la vida diaria. La posibilidad diagnostica de un trastorno depresivo a partir de datos observacionales poco especificos: deterioro en la apariencia y aspecto personal, lentitud en los movimientos, marcha cansina, tono de voz bajo, facies tristes o poco expresivas, llanto facil o espontaneo en la consulta, escasa concentracion durante la entrevista, verbalizacion de idealizacion pesimista, quejas hipocondriacas, alteraciones en el ritmo del sueno, quejas somaticas difusas y dificiles de encuadrar. (Alberdi Sadupe, Taboada, & Vazquez , 2006).\r\nEn su forma mas grave, puede conducir al suicidio, si es leve, se puede tratar sin necesidad de tratamiento farmacologico, pero cuando tiene caracter moderado o grave se pueden necesitar farmacos y psicoterapia profesional. (OMS, 2017)\r\nEn un estudio realizado a 500 estudiantes universitarios en Lima-Peru, se encontro que la prevalencia de depresion segun los niveles de complejidad corresponde el 9.7% a depresion leve, el 2.8% a depresion moderada y el 0.05% a una depresion severa. \r\nLa presente investigacion busca determinar la prevalencia de la depresion de los estudiantes universitarios en la ciudad Bucaramanga en el ano 2017; utilizando un instrumento disenado para evaluarla clasificandola: en rango normal, ligeramente deprimido, moderadamente deprimido y severamente deprimido.

      "abstract": "Abstract Recovery is the process of managing your addiction and mood disorder and making changes in your life.1 Recovery requires hard work, discipline, a commitment to change, and a willingness to address both of your disorders. Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

      "abstract": "Die postpartalen psychischen Störungen lassen sich im Wesentlichen drei Gruppen zuordnen: Dem so genannten \"Baby Blues\", der Wochenbettdepression und der Wochenbettpsychose. Der etwa 3 - 5 Tage nach Entbindung auftretende Baby Blues kommt nach 50 - 70 % aller Geburten vor und klingt nach etwa einer Woche ohne weitere Therapie meist folgenlos ab. Allerdings entwickeln 20 - 30 % dieser Frauen im weiteren Wochenbettverlauf eine Depression, weshalb bei über 2 Wochen post partum persistierenden Bluessymptomen eine genauere Exploration hinsichtlich einer Depression zu empfehlen ist. Wochenbettdepressionen betreffen 10 - 15 % aller Entbundenen; sie treten meist mehrere Wochen bis Monate nach Entbindung in Form einer depressiven Verstimmung mit Schlafstörungen, Ängstlichkeit, Antriebsmangel, Interessenverlust und Schuldgefühlen bis hin zu Selbstmordgedanken auf. Um sie nicht als Babyblues fehlzudeuten, sind gezielte Fragen nach der Stimmungslage der jungen Mutter bei der Untersuchung 6 Wochen post partum, ggfs. unter Anwendung der Edinburgh-Skala zu empfehlen. Patientinnen mit bekannten Risikofaktoren für die Entwicklung einer Wochenbettdepression (Z.n. Wochenbettdepression oder Wochenbettpsychose, depressive Erkrankung, Angsterkrankung, bipolare Erkrankung) bedürfen einer engmaschigen Überwachung und ggfs. einer prophylaktischen Behandlung in Kooperation mit dem Psychiater. Leichtere Formen der Wochenbettdepression sind ambulant mit psychotherapeutischen und soziotherapeutischen Maßnahmen meist gut zu behandeln. Bei schwereren Verläufen sind Antidepressiva (selektive Serotoninwiederaufnahmehemmer (SSRI) oder bestimmte Trizyklika) indiziert. Postpartale Angst- und Zwangsstörungen sprechen gut auf Psychotherapie an; bei Angsterkrankungen werden außerdem Benzodiazepine, bei Zwangserkrankungen SSRI empfohlen. Wochenbettpsychosen (ca. 0,1 - 0,2 %) treten vermehrt bei bekannter bipolarer oder schizoaffektiver Störung bzw. bei Z.n. Wochenbettpsychose auf. Sie müssen vor allem wegen der Gefahr des erweiterten Suizids stationär behandelt werden; idealerweise erfolgt dies in interdisziplinären Mutter-Kind-Einheiten.",

      "title": "The Impact of Chemical Changes in The Brain Caused by Chronic Stress Can Trigger Depression",
      "abstract": "The present research has attempted to study the link between chronic stress, the chemical changes in the brain caused by it, and depression. Chronic stress (also known as chronic strain) has been defined in a variety of ways, but it usually refers to one or more types of stress that have persisted for at least many months. Numerous chemical changes occur in the human brain when the human body is subjected to chronic stress over a lengthy period. Chronic or ongoing stress can cause several psychological and physiological problems and stress has been found to influence brain chemicals including cortisol and corticotropin-releasing factor. Cortisol levels that are elevated for an extended period have been related to mood disorders and hippocampus shrinkage in the brain. Stress is a key contributor to chronic inflammation in the body. Furthermore, diabetes and heart disease can also be caused by chronic inflammation. Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels in the blood and has an effect on serotonin levels in the body. This contributes to the fact that continuous stress causes a series of chemical changes in the human brain, which may simply make the individual more prone to developing depression or relapsing (the condition is prone to recur in someone who has recovered). These physiological and biochemical changes make the human body more sensitive to depression and make it more likely to acquire the mental illness (known as Major Depressive Disorder). The current study examined many research studies that support a substantial relationship between chronic stress and depression",

A more age-appropriate and functional realignment of psychiatric categories linked to dysfunctional anger is suggested. Among other recommendations, this realignment would remove irritability as a problematic definer in the present DSM mood categories: expand oppositional defiant disorder to include adults; link the callous unemotional subtype of conduct disorder in adolescents to antisocial personality disorder; move intermittent explosive disorder to an appropriate category: and expand the term 'mood' to apply also to dysfunctional anger and anxiety.The non-specific term 'irritability' commonly used in the DSM has had an adverse effect on diagnostic specificity and thereby on treatment.

Even when the term “antisocial” is used in other than a legal or criminological sense – for example, when it is applied in psychiatric diagnostics in an attempt to define and understand individual human behavior more fully – it remains overinclusive. From a clinical standpoint, the term “antisocial” most often signifies antisocial personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1952, 1968, 1980), which in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) is considered an “axis II” personality disorder, which may or may not coexist with certain “axis I” clinical syndromes or other conditions. Simply stated, this means that, according to current diagnostic nomenclature, an antisocial personality disorder theoretically could coexist with an organic mental disorder, substance use disorder, paranoid disorder, depressive disorder, psychosexual disorder, and so on.",

      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

PMD can be represented by different types of excitation, mistaken judgments (including paranoidal ones, confabulations, false orientation), false perception (psychosensory, in particular, illusory and hallucinatory phenomena) and affective disorders. Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly). Irritation of different brain structures and their disconnection as well as pathological neuroplasticity in prolonged forms--are considered the basis for PMD occurrence.",

      "abstract": "The conceptualisation of anxiety has been expanded to include the traditionally recognised trait anxiety and the newer construct, anxiety sensitivity. Anxiety is often a precursor to depression. Rumination is a risk factor not only for depression but also for a related range of conditions such as anxiety, substance abuse and eating disorders. Evidence for the value of low self-esteem in predicting the development of anxiety and depressive symptomatology in adolescence and emerging adulthood is inconclusive due to the complex and multifaceted relationship between self-esteem and mental health outcomes. In contrast, a parenting style that was perceived as warm and authoritative was positively associated with active coping and negatively associated with anxiety. Mood and anxiety disorders, running away, and a sense of hopelessness also increase the risk for adolescent suicide attempts. Intervention should focus on breaking the cycle of depression and negative coping and should include an analysis of cognitions and attributions.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "Cognitive, life stress, and interpersonal approaches to a developmental psychopathology model of depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract One pathway to depression in children and adults is hypothesized to result from complex transactions among cognitive, stress, and interpersonal variables. Cognitive vulnerability includes not only appraisals of events and circumstances that emphasize personal unworthiness and incompetence, but also underlying beliefs and “working models” of the self and others. Such cognitions arise in part in the context of maladaptive attachment relations with the parents and may be reinforced by interpersonal incompetencies and difficulties in peer, family, and social relationships. Stressful conditions in early life and throughout development may undermine or erode the development of effective coping competencies. Moreover, maladaptive cognitions about the self and others, and ineffective coping competencies, may contribute to the occurrence of stressful events and circumstances —and these in turn may trigger depressive reactions. For many depressed people with chronic or recurrent depression, therefore, developmental processes play critical roles in the origin and continuation of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "This article uses a version of the vulnerability-stress model to examine psychosocial factors related to the onset, course, and treatment of schizophrenia. High-risk studies, most of which study offspring of a schizophrenic parent, suggest that signs of vulnerability to the disorder may emerge in early to middle childhood in neuromotor integration, attentional and information-processing abilities, and deviant social behavior. It is still not clear that these markers are specific to the subsequent development of schizophrenia. The evidence for stressful family relationships as potentiators of the disorder in vulnerable offspring is also reviewed. Although few studies are available that bear directly on this issue, the preliminary evidence suggests that further investigation is warranted. Stressors, particularly those arising from within the family, are also examined as they relate to the course of schizophrenia. The data on expressed emotion (EE) have been replicated more often than not, although the origins of high EE attitudes are not precisely understood. These attitudes do not arise as reactions to the form or severity of a relative's disorder, but they may relate to the length of time between initial onset of the disorder and first hospitalization. Family-based intervention programs, overlaid on regular antipsychotic drug treatment, appear to reduce the risk for relapse in the short-term. At least one of the mechanisms of action of these programs is to reduce the negative affective climate in the family.",

      "title": "CHRONIC PAIN IN SURVIVORS OF TORTURE – Psyche or Soma?",
      "abstract": "Persistent pain related to the musculo-skeletal system is the most frequent reported physical complaint in survivors of torture. In spite of a long-standing tradition of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, however, there is no consensus on how chronic pain and pain-related disability are best addressed within this clinical practice. Are pain problems in torture survivors to be viewed as a somatic problem and intensively investigated and managed as such, or assumed to be the presentation/concomitant of psychological disturbance such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other trauma-related problem? The current paper is intended as an overview of chronic pain in torture survivors viewed from the perspectives offered by the interactive and multivariate theoretical models of pain. According to these models pain should be viewed not as the result of either solely physical or solely psychological causes, but rather as a set of bio-physiological, psychosocial and behavioural factors contributing to the total experience of pain. Consequently, appropriate assessment of chronic pain requires assessment of more than just the direct components of pain. Given the complexity inherent in the construct of subjective pain, there is a need to obtain a diversity of assessment information that must then be integrated to understand the individuals’ pain and to contribute to treatment decision-making. Overemphasising the importance of psychological aspects, however, may result in insufficient somatic pain diagnoses and reduced treatment efficacy. Basic knowledge of the physiology of pain is therefore a prerequisite when assessing, diagnosing, and managing individuals suffering from chronic pain conditions. A brief introduction to the physiology of pain has therefore been enclosed in this paper, focusing on chronic, persistent pain and the pain signalling system under abnormal conditions. Possible pain generating mechanisms in chronic post-torture pain are highlighted and how to use clinical information and an understanding of pain classification to identify these mechanisms. Clinically, a failure to appreciate the intricacies of the relation and co-occurrence of trauma-related problems and chronic pain carries a risk of poor clinical decision-making, selection for treatment, and design of therapeutic intervention. It is advocated that chronic post-torture pain should be viewed from the perspectives offered by the interactive and multivariate models of pain and stress, and that knowledge-based clinical guidelines for the assessment and interdisciplinary management emphasising biomedical, behavioural, and cognitive aspects of chronic pain and pain-associated disability in torture survivors should be developed based on these models.",

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

      "abstract": "The problem of the determination of the degree of culpability of an individual who has committed an anti-social act is sometimes associated with great difficulties. A variety of factors may enter into the solution of this problem. An illegal act may be committed accidentally or unexpectedly and independently of the individual's will. It may be committed under an unavoidable necessity, such as in cases of protection of ones self or ones family. It may be committed under the influence of extreme passion or anger, when consciousness becomes blurred and cerebral inhibition is obliterated. It may be committed by insane individuals whose delusional ideas, accompanied or not by hallucinatory images, develop morbid impulses or deliberate and well planned criminal tendencies. Finally, illegal acts may be committed by individuals who, though not insane in the strict sense of the word, are nevertheless different from normal individuals by their power of reasoning, by their sentiments, tastes, sympathies, etc. To this class belongs the large category of psychopathic individuals, and also the mental defectives. The discussion of the underlying psychological moments of each of these groups of individuals is comprised in an extensive literature. We will be concerned exclusively with the medico-legal relation of the latter group alone. In order to ascertain the degree of legal responsibility of mental defectives, it is necessary first to emphasize the characteristic clinical features of mental deficiency. In considering all varieties of deviation from normal in the psychic sphere we find a long scale beginning with mental monstrosities and ending with slight mental feebleness. When the intellectual powers are involved in their entirety we deal with idiocy. When the arrest of mental development is only incomplete and is, therefore, compatible with the existence of some intellectual manifestations, we deal with imbecility. There are also individuals in whom only certain powers are likely to reach a degree of development; in whom there is no general, but only partial defect of intellectual powers. For example, one will show a meager power of intellectual acquisition, in another the power of judgment is defective; another is incapable of acquiring ele-",

      "abstract": "A 29-year-old man was admitted because of sudden onset of retrograde amnesia. The patient was unable to recall events having occurred during the past 2 years. The impairment was especially serious with regard to personal memories during the 5 months prior to admission, while he had first been working as a full-time employee under stressful circumstance. A diagnosis of dissociative amnesia was made on the basis of absence of any systemic or neurological diseases that could cause amnesia, the inadaptable character of the patient, the nature of amnesia, and presence of stressful condition possibly related to the amnesia. Visual event-related potential (ERP) studies recorded with human face discrimination tasks demonstrated a P3a wave in response to a face of his superior in the office, whom he said that he had never seen before. The similar P3a wave was observed in response to a face quite familiar to the patient, his mother, but not to a face truly unknown to him. These findings suggest that the visual memory of his superior's face exists in the brain, but the patient is unable to retrieve it by some psychogenic mechanism. 131I-IMP SPECT revealed decreased perfusion in the left medial temporal lobe and the basal forebrain, suggesting the association between dissociative amnesia and focal brain dysfunction. While dissociative amnesia has been understood as psychogenic nature, both ERPs and SPECT are quite important tools to understand the association between the psychological phenomenon and biological changes of the brain in this disorder.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Moreover, autonomic nervous system functioning and post-exertional malaise examination is considered to be important in diagnosis of adolescent patients with ME/CFS. The presented analysis of research shows that adolescents with ME/CFS urge to be understood and believed regarding an illness that few understood. Continuing education and remaining the social activity in young ME/CFS patients seems to be crucial in maintaining quality of life. ME/CFS in adolescents might lead to significant problems related to the school absenteeism, poorer quality of life at school, school and academic achievement compared to healthy adolescents. Anxiety might co-occur with ME/CFS in adolescents. Supportive therapy for comorbidities could be considered, if needed. However, there is no established effective treatment for ME/CFS, for which there is urgent need. (JNNN 2020;9(2):76–79)",

Psychogenesis is doubtful in cooperative patients from whom an initiating conflict-situation cannot be evaluated, if the time of onset does not relate to onset of symptoms, even if the pattern of symptoms seem to correlate with the structure of personality. 2. If a patient is too readily convinced of an exclusively mental source of his problems, one has to be aware of to deal with mechanisms called \"inhibition of bodily threat\" or \"inhibition of death\". These states of mental inhibition may also serve to demonstrate feelings of revenge against the respective individual.",

      "abstract": "У статті розглядається питання необхідності дослідження особистісної саморегуляції в дітей із порушеннями інтелектуального розвитку. Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

But such a perverted condition of the moral sense is so almost invariably indicated, and often only discovered by the activity of the animal propensities, that it is more convenient to treat of it under the third class of mental disorders. It is likewise more consistent with our adopted principle of classification, which consists in referring each mental disorder to that group of faculties, the affection of which is essential to its manifestations. In homicidal mania, the animal propensities are of necessity called into action, whether the homicidal act be the result of their diseased action, in association with a healthy condition of the higher sentiments, or of their normal action when associated with, and therefore uncontrolled by, a state of the moral sense rendered powerless or feeble by disease; be it congenital or acquired, or the result of functional disorder or structural changes. We usually become cognizant of diseased mental conditions by positive, not by negative, symptoms; some overt act or explosion of passion will, in general, be the first proof of such disease of the moral sentiments, as involves their occlusion or inertness, when they ought to be in exercise. Should the disease be of such a nature as to increase the activity of these faculties, then we have an exhibition of religious excitement or ecstasy, a morbid condition already treated of.",

It is a complex construct that encompasses (1) primary emotions, or affects, and secondary emotions, with each category having its own characteristics, amplitude, and duration, (2) rapid shifting from neutral or valenced affect to intense affect, and (3) dysfunctional modulation of emotions. Affective instability is often confused with mood lability, as in bipolar disorders, as well as with other terms. To clarify the concept, we searched databases for the termaffective instabilityand read related articles on the topic. In this article we situate the term within the current affective nomenclature and human emotional experience, explore its psychophysiological features, and place it within the context of psychopathology. We explain why the term can potentially be confused with mood pathology and then define affective instability as an inherited temperamental trait modulated by developmental experience.",

An alternative, dimensional approach assumes that psychotic symptoms are continuous with normal experiences and are not necessarily associated with disability. Evidence for a continuum of psychosis comes from studies showing that the core symptoms of psychosis, delusions and hallucinations, are much more prevalent in the general population than their clinical counterparts. These milder forms of expression of psychosis show similar patterns of associations with demographic and environmental risk factors as the clinical disorder, providing further support for the notion of continuity. Although the majority of individuals experiencing these lesser psychotic “symptoms” are not in need of care, they may nevertheless have an increased risk of developing a clinical disorder. Transitions over the psychosis continuum may in part be driven by the cognitive and emotional response to the psychotic or psychosislike experiences.",

Although test scales measuring fatigue and depression share a significant number of items related to somatic functioning,2 most authors distinguish fatigue from depression, the latter being characterized by lack of selfesteem, despair or a feeling of hopelessness. Most authors also agree that fatigue does not depend on overall or motor disability (as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)3). This is in line with the clinical observation that fatigue may be the presenting symptom of MS, occurring at a time where there is minimal or no neurological disability.1",

However, there is growing evidence for the role of habit forming in OCD. That questions the role of affective symptoms in OCD, such as anxiety or disgust. However affective symptoms, in particular depressive symptoms and anxiety, also occur during the course of OCD. How do affective symptoms and obsessive-compulsive symptoms relate to each other during the longterm course of OCD? These questions were investigated during provoked obessive-compulsive symptoms as well as during the six-years-course of OCD. The conclusion is that affective symptoms have an important role regarding the experience and the course of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms and that affective and obsessive-compulsive symptoms affect each other during the longterm course of OCD.",

La identificación del duelo complicado es central para poder ofrecer tratamientos adecuados.

En este estudio descriptivo participaron un total de 68 personas que habían sufrido una pérdida, al menos seis meses antes de la evaluación. Completaron una batería de pruebas sobre intensidad del duelo y psicopatología. Los resultados señalan que todas las variables psicopatológicas mostraron altas relaciones significativas con la intensidad de síntomas de duelo. La centralidad con que se percibió la pérdida y los sentimientos de hostilidad predijeron en gran medida los valores de duelo complicado y con mayor intensidad de experiencias de duelo y de síntomas psicopatológicos. El perfil sintomatológico en duelo complicado se relaciona con un gran abanico de psicopatología. La pérdida de un hijo parece ser un importante factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de duelo complicado. The loss of a loved one may provoke complicated grief, which is characterized by intense symptoms of yearning, sadness, or loss of life meaning. Identifying those at risk of developing complicated grief is crucial to provide adequate treatment. However, little is known about the symptom profile or the influence that the type of loss may have on grief intensity. A descriptive design was carried out. A total of 68 participants that have lost a loved one due to death, at least six months ago, took part on the research. They completed a range of emotional self-report measures. All psychopathological variables showed high and significant relations with the intensity of grief. The centrality perceived and feelings of hostility predicted the score of complicated grief. Finally, the loss of a son was associated with complicated grief and with higher scores on the experiences of loss and emotional psychopathology. Symptom profile of those with complicated grief is associated with a large number of psychopathological variables, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of a son seems to be an important risk factor for developing complicated grief.",

      "abstract": "Burnout or professional fatigue syndrome has never been more talked about than in recent times. It is the result of exposure to a situation in which the strategies of the subject who are supposed to manage the stresses of the environment become outdated and inoperative. An imbalance is created between the demands and the material, operational and psychological resources to cope with them. Many health professions are confronted with the challenge of managing burnout. Among them, the general practitioner is very often on the front line. This paper is dedicated to him in priority. In its first part, it deals successively with the classification of the pathology (ICD-10 and DSM-5), its prevalence, its socio-economic impacts, its clinical picture (three stages), its diagnosis (by clinic and questionnaires), its causes, its evolution (from denial to acceptance), and its long-term consequences in the absence of treatment.Le burnout ou syndrome de fatigue professionnelle n’a jamais autant fait parler de lui que ces derniers temps.

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent and understudied mental health problems in late life. Specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder are the most prevalent anxiety disorders in older adults among the 11 disorders identified by the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (fifth edition). Anxiety disorders lead to significant functional burdens and interface with physical health problems and cognitive impairment, concerns frequently experienced in adults over age 65. Additional contextual factors should be considered when assessing and treating late-life anxiety, including the effects of polypharmacy, other mental health conditions, role changes, and societal attitudes toward aging. The relationship between anxiety and physical health problems in older adults can be causal or contextual, and can involve poorer estimates of subjective health and lower ratings of functioning. These factors present unique challenges to the detection, conceptualization, and treatment of late-life anxiety, including the tendency for older adults to focus on somatic symptoms and the potential for long-term behaviors that can mask distress such as substance use. Researchers are increasingly incorporating a gerodiversity framework to understand the contributions of cultural, individual, and other group differences that may affect the presentation of anxiety symptoms and disorders. Older adults in general are less likely to be treated for anxiety disorders, and intersecting individual and group differences likely further affect how anxiety disorders are perceived by healthcare providers. Cognitive behavioral therapy and its variants have the most empirical support for treatment. Newer evidence lends support to acceptance and commitment therapy and problem-solving therapy, which tend to address some of the contextual factors that may be important in treatment.",

Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

Como trastorno medico, el desgaste profesional no tiene una definicion clara, pero ha sido bien definido como trastorno psicologico, y es cada vez mas reconocido por las personas que trabajan en profesiones relacionadas con la atencion. Desde hace tiempo sindrome de Burnout se ha identificado como un problema crucial en la atencion; sin embargo, se conoce relativamente poco acerca de las medidas que pueden tomarse para prevenirlo o mitigarlo por este motivo presentamos estrategias de tratamiento que ayuden a disminuir los sintomas y mejorar la calidad de vida y atencion de los profesionales de la salud.",

Health care seeking may not be related to the presence of physical disease but may reflect social problems, psychological disturbance, or frank psychiatric disorder. Management of unexplained physical symptoms depends on the duration of symptoms. If acute, exclusion of physical disease, as well as providing symptomatic care, is a priority. The patient's fears of illness need to be addressed and an explanation in simple terms of the symptoms provided. Adverse life situations should be identified and, where possible, rectified. Psychiatric disorders require appropriate treatment. When symptoms are chronic, conservative management is required to contain the symptoms and avoid iatrogenic problems.",

      "title": "The Importance of Early Diagnosis of Somatic Symptom Disorder: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "A somatic symptom disorder (SSD) diagnosis is made when a person places emphasis on physical symptoms such as pain, exhaustion, or shortness of breath so much that it causes significant suffering and/or functional issues. The individual's thoughts, sentiments, and activities are an overstated reaction to such symptoms. Regardless of whether the physical symptoms are connected to a diagnosable medical condition, the person experiences symptoms and believes they are ill. When a person exhibits symptoms that satisfy the diagnostic standards of an SSD, the disease should be identified. However, due to the disorder's frequent co-occurrence, particularly with anxiety and depressive disorders, support for these concurrent diagnoses should be sought. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, and medication are all examples of effective treatments for SSD. It has been demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) aid in treating symptoms. The authors describe the case of an eight-year-old boy with complaints of abdominal pain that were unexplained by various tests. The pain lasted 10 years and was episodic (each episode lasted around 10 days; one particular episode lasted approximately six months). Multiple investigations were conducted, but no physiological reason for his symptoms was discovered. His evaluation was conducted by an interdisciplinary team that included neurologists, psychiatrists, surgeons, and doctors. The underlying cause was subsequently determined to be SSD. As people with SSD present to general practitioners and the emergency room rather than psychiatric facilities, this incident serves as a sobering reminder of the need to advocate for an accurate diagnosis of this condition.",

      "abstract": "Due to the anatomical intricacy of the region and the possibility of psychological as well as physical damage, maxillofacial injuries are unique. High rates of general psychological morbidity, including stress, anxiety, depression, and “psychiatric disorder,” have been documented following maxillofacial trauma. These conditions may eventually result in PTSD and behavioral changes. Injury-related facial disfigurement reduces self-esteem and triggers a generally negative social response, which is typically manifested by social withdrawal. These factors have a further detrimental impact on the person’s mental condition, thereby affecting their quality of life. When a patient reports an injury, the main aim is to restore the esthetic and functional components. The emotional and mental state of patients is rarely ever recorded. Providing early support in the form of psychotherapy and guidance to the patient in light of such psychological impact following trauma can improve their overall emotional status and quality of life.",

Treatments aimed at improvement of depressive symptoms do not automatically lead to functional recovery in terms of return to work, and if they do, there is generally a long time lag. Several approaches have been suggested to improve return to work, that generally imply that the sick-listed employee should not wait for remission before resuming work, but rather try to return gradually. Personal as well as work factors influence the outcome of such a process, so that this approach has interpersonal as well as workplace implications that should be addressed at the same time as personal factors and the depressive symptoms.",

      "title": "Aggression and Violence",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

The distinct and clear definition is a premise of defining and constructing all further critical incident stress management (CISM) modules. Crucial aspects in dealing with CISM are the description and the definition of the CI itself. The situation of a CI goes beyond normal, common experiences and, therefore, the people affected find themselves in an extremely stressful condition. While CIS are a normal survival mechanism, post traumatic stress disorder is the pathogen manifestation of CIS which were not sufficiently coped with. In order to understand why CIS are considered as normal reactions to an abnormal event, it might be helpful to give an insight into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. The psychological and physical reactions are initiated by neurobiological pathways and can be considered normal reactions to an abnormal event.",

      "title": "Qualitat de vida, adaptació social i estrès en joves amb un primer episodi psicòtic o en risc de psicosi",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIO:\nLa qualitat de vida i el funcionament social han esdevingut bons indicadors per mesurar la millora clinica dels trastorns psicotics, i han estat ampliament estudiats en persones amb esquizofrenia. En les primeres fases de la psicosi el funcionament psicosocial i la qualitat de vida romanen sovint deteriorades fins i tot despres de la remissio dels simptomes psicotics, afectant als resultats a llarg termini de la malaltia. Es frequent tambe que aquest pitjor funcionament estigui present abans de l’aparicio del primer episodi psicotic (PEP), en la coneguda fase prodromica, fase caracteristica dels subjectes coneguts com Estats Mentals d’Alt Risc (EMAR). Per altra banda, el paper de l’estres en l’aparicio d’un trastorn psicotic ha estat objecte d’estudi i ha estat conceptualitzat en el que es coneix com el model de vulnerabilitat-estres per explicar l’etiopatogenesi de l’esquizofrenia: persones amb una predisposicio genetica a la malaltia la desenvoluparan o no en funcio de la relacio amb l’ambient i els successos que esdevinguin al llarg de la seva vida. L’estres pero, tambe ha estat estudiat en altre vessants i processos que afecten l’evolucio de la malaltia, com per exemple en que l’us d’estrategies d’afrontament negatives davant l’estres implica l’empitjorament de la qualitat de vida en pacients amb psicosi, o tambe en el fet que pacients amb psicosi sense ocupacio laboral refereixen majors nivells d’estres que els que treballen, essent la ocupacio laboral un element intimament relacionat amb la qualitat de vida en persones amb psicosi. Alguns elements d’estres clarament identificats dins dels anomentats aconteixements vitals estressats, com ara el maltractament infantil, tambe s’ han associat a una pitjor adaptacio premorbida en pacients que han debutat amb alguna malaltia psicotica. OBJECTIUS:\nL’objectiu principal de l’estudi va ser explorar la relacio entre la qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social en joves amb una psicosis incipient i investigar-ne els possibles efectes mediadors de les mesures d’estres. Per altra banda es pretenia analitzar la correlacio entre el maltractament infantil, com a esdeveniment estressant major, i l’adaptacio social.\n METODOLOGIA:\nAquesta tesi doctoral consta de tres treballs. El primer es un estudi analitic observacional i transversal on es van comparar les mesures d’estres i de qualitat de vida entre un grup de pacients considerats EMAR atesos en el servei de l’Equip d’Intervencio Precoc i un grup de quaranta controls sans. Posteriorment es va estratificar el grup de joves EMAR en funcio de l’adaptacio social que presentaven (baixa o normal segons puntuacions en l’escala d’adaptacio social SASS) i es va analitzar la qualitat de vida en base a aquesta estratificacio. Per ultim es va realitzar un analisi de mediacio per explorar si les mesures d’estres intervenien en la relacio entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida.\nEl segon, es un estudi observacional i prospectiu on es va mesurar la qualitat de vida, l’adaptacio social i les mesures d’estres de forma basal i a l’any posterior a la presentacio d’un PEP. L’evolucio de la qualitat de vida es va analitzar en funcio de les puntuacions en l’adaptacio social. Paral·lelament es van comaprar els resultats basals del grup de joves amb un PEP amb un grup de cinquanta-cinc controls sans i tambe es va mesurar l’efecte de mediacio de l’estres entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida en aquest grup d’estudi. \nEl tercer es tracta d’un estudi analitic observacional i transversal, on es va analitzar la relacio del maltractament infantil amb l’adaptacio social en totes les seves dimensions, d’un grup de joves amb una psicosi incipient utilitzant un model d’equacions estructurals, que permet un analisis multivariant de diferents subconjunts de variables, a l’hora que permet analitzar la relacio causal de variables de diferents grups.\n RESULTATS:\nEstudi 1.\nEls pacients EMAR van reportar taxes d’ocupacio laboral mes baixes, mes estres, pitjor qualitat de vida i menor adaptacio social que els controls sans. La qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social es van associar a les mesures d’estres. Els subjectes EMAR amb baixa adaptacio social van reportar mes estres percebut i pitjor qualitat de vida que els EMAR amb adaptacio social normal i que els controls sans. L’estres percebut va intervenir explicant la relacio que s’estableix entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida. \nEstudi 2. \nEls pacients van reportar una pitjor qualitat de vida, una pitjor adaptacio social i mes estres que els controls sans. Els pacients amb un PEP van millorar significativament la qualitat de vida i les mesures d’estres al llarg de l’any de seguiment, pero no l’adaptacio social. L’estres percebut va mediar l’associacio entre una pitjor adaptacio social i una qualitat de vida inferior. \nEstudi 3. \nEls EMAR van presentar mes negligencia emocional i pitjor adaptacio social comparats amb els PEP. El Model d'Equacions Estructurals (MEE) emprat va mostrar que el maltractament s’associa a una pitjor adaptacio social, principalment en dominis que impliquen relacions interpersonals. Quan els simptomes depressius fan de mediadors, es a dir, que expliquen com es la relacio que s’estableix entre el maltractament i l’adaptacio social, tambe es veuen afectats els dominis d’oci i treball i interessos socio-culturals. CONCLUSIONS:\nL’adaptacio social es menor en els subjectes EMAR que en subjectes sans. Aquesta te un impacte negatiu sobre la qualitat de vida dels joves EMAR. L’associacio entre la qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social esta influenciada per l’estres percebut.\nEn el cas dels joves amb un PEP, l’adaptacio social a l’inici pot determinar la qualitat de vida durant el periode d’un any posterior a l’inici de la malaltia. Malgrat la millora en la majoria de mesures estudiades en l’any posterior al PEP, els pacients no aconsegueixen el mateix nivell de qualitat de vida que els del grup sense patologia. \nPer ultim, els antecedents de maltractament infantil influeixen negativament en l’adaptacio social de joves amb una psicosi incipient.",

      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of the activity of an operator controlling a complex technical system depends not only on his professional qualifications and his vested interest in obtaining a high rating but also on his actual functional state, the most important characteristics of which are: level of alertness, degree of emotional tension, and fatigue. These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Occupational stress was perceived to be a problem only in jobs with high pressure and low pay, such as teaching and social services. Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

      "abstract": "Emotions have not often been studied in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Most existing studies have assessed the psychopathological manifestations involved, essentially depression and less frequently anxiety. The results have shown that major depressive episodes and anxious episodes are not frequent in ALS patients, although moderate depressive or anxious symptoms are often observed, but less frequently than in other diseases like multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Depressive symptoms are not correlated to the duration or severity of the disease. This has led us to investigate the coping mechanisms involved in ALS. Results of previously published studies have shown that they did not differ from those observed in other somatic diseases, but ALS patients show more frequent concern with spirituality and religious preoccupations. It thus appears necessary to make a more detailed study of how ALS patients cope with the disease and its ominous consequences. Emotional processing difficulties may be a factor underlying quite diverse somatic and psychological disorders. The Baker's model propose five stages in emotional processing: emotional experience, emotional expression, labelling, linkage and awareness. Assessment of the emotional processing used by ALS patients should improve our comprehension of their adaptive functioning. The patients' caregivers play an essential role, and studies have shown that they often suffer themselves from depression and the burdens involved, and that the perceived social support has an impact on the quality of life and on the depression of the patients. Therefore, it seems important to assess the emotional processing not only of patients but also of their caregivers.",

One of older adults' well-known problems relates to the fact that their quality of life can be threatened by physical health stresses and associated depressive symptomatology. Common health problems among older adults often contribute to depressive symptomatology, and, in turn, depressive symptoms may further compromise older adults' health. It is thus an important task to discover factors that can protect older adults from experiencing the negative emotional consequences of health stresses. Using ideas from the life-span theory of control, we show how to adaptively manage the negative consequences of health problems in the elderly. Active investments in overcoming health problems that are controllable should result in positive outcomes. In contrast, it may be beneficial for older adults to disengage from health goals that are unattainable. By adjusting their control-related behaviors to the controllability of specific health stresses, older adults can maintain their psychological and physical health.",

This article examines the evidence for yet another claimed effect of boredom and monotony, viz., that these factors are stressors, and that because they are stressors, they may produce effects even more detrimental than those mentioned above. Both laboratory and field studies are examined for evidence of increased neuroendocrine activity during exposure to conditions determined to be, or generally acknowledged to be, boring or monotonous. It is concluded that the available data offer no support for the belief that boredom or monotony per se produces the syndrome of stress. However, monotony coupled with a need to maintain high levels of alertness could represent a combination capable of eliciting considerable stress.",

However, which of these confer risk independently is uncertain, and the implications of their overlap, combinations, and interactions are poorly understood. Potential explanatory mechanisms are being characterized with increasing detail and sophistication. Of particular interest are psychobiological processes initiated by stress. Other mechanisms involve stress-related health behaviors and illness behaviors that delay or reduce the effectiveness of medical treatment. With some promising exceptions, findings of intervention trials are uncertain regarding the effectiveness of psychological treatments for modifying affective traits and mental disorders to reduce their impact on cardiovascular disease. Recent developments include novel conceptualizations of mental disorders; examination of the interplay between cognitive factors and emotion; and theoretical frameworks that integrate psychological stress processes with neuroscience, health behavior, and social cognition. Also promising is increased attention to gender identity and minority group membership.",

      "title": "Estudio de la eficacia de un tratamiento psicológico breve en la disminución de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "El trastorno de panico se define como un trastorno en el que los ataques de panico presentan de forma inesperada y recurrente y al menos uno de ellos va seguido de un minimo de un mes de inquietud o preocupacion persistente por la aparicion de nuevas crisis o sus consecuencias, y/o por un cambio significativo y desadaptativo en el comportamiento que se relaciona con los ataques de panico. El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

When depression appears within days after stroke onset, it is likely to remit, whereas depression at 3 months is likely to be sustained for 1 year. One of the major problems posed by elderly stroke patients is how to identify and optimally manage PSD. This review provides insight to identification and management of depression in elderly stroke patients. Depression following stroke is less likely to include dysphoria and more likely characterized by vegetative signs and symptoms compared with other forms of late-life depression, and clinicians should rely more on nonsomatic symptoms rather than somatic symptoms. Evaluation and diagnosis of depression among elderly stroke patients are more complex due to vague symptoms of depression, overlapping signs and symptoms of stroke and depression, lack of properly trained health care personnel, and insufficient assessment tools for proper diagnosis. Major goals of treatment are to reduce depressive symptoms, improve mood and quality of life, and reduce the risk of medical complications including relapse. Antidepressants (ADs) are generally not indicated in mild forms because the balance of benefit and risk is not satisfactory in elderly stroke patients. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the first choice of PSD treatment in elderly patients due to their lower potential for drug interaction and side effects, which are more common with tricyclic ADs. Recently, stimulant medications have emerged as promising new therapeutic interventions for PSD and are now the subject of rigorous clinical trials. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also be useful, and electroconvulsive therapy is available for patients with severe refractory PSD.Keywords: depression, poststroke, stroke",

      "abstract": "To make a diagnosis of concussion, you need a reliable history of 2 things: (1) An acute external physical force applied to the brain AND (2) An impairment in the function of the brain directly caused by the external physical force. One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

      "title": "Prescribing for depressed adolescents: Office decision-making in the face of limited research evidence",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a relatively common, disabling, potentially life-threatening medical condition.1 MDD is diagnosed when there are five or more symptoms occurring over 2 or more weeks.2 Adult and adolescent symptoms of MDD are almost the same. However, irritable mood and lack of weight gain can qualify as depressive symptoms in adolescents.2 The lifetime prevalence of unipolar depression (MDD or dysthymic disorder) in adolescence is 11.7%; three-quarters of this percentage suffer severe impairment.3 Adolescent MDD has very high levels of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders.4 Depression is the condition most commonly implicated in adolescent and adult suicide.5 Adolescent depression runs a remitting and relapsing course, often recurring later in adolescence or adulthood6, 7 (see Fig. 1). Of those adolescents who recover from their depression, about 50% will have another depressive episode in the next 5 years.6, 8 In summary, adolescent MDD is a serious and sometimes chronic medical condition that requires assertive treatment. Course of adolescent major depression. *No depressive symptoms for over 2 months. A number of antidepressants have come onto the market since 1987 that provide fewer side effects at therapeutic dose and in overdose than the older tricyclic antidepressants.9, 10 These newer agents include the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram), the serotonin–norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine) and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine). The prescribing of antidepressants to children and adolescents has increased from 1996 to 2007.11 Overall, 19% of Australian paediatricians and 68% of child psychiatrists self-report prescribing SSRIs.12 However, this is very unlikely to be specifically for major depression, as paediatricians prescribe across a broad variety of diagnoses and at times for off-label conditions. The SSRIs are a class of antidepressant that have a high affinity for blocking the presynaptic serotonin transport proteins but not the other monoamine transmembrane transport proteins.13 SSRIs differ in their effects through secondary binding to non-serotonergic receptors,14 the antidepressant effects of their metabolites, their excretion half-lives and their effect on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.15 Despite their differences, the available SSRIs are all effective treatments for moderate adult depression16 and display similar overall side effect profiles.15 In 2004, evidence emerged from antidepressant trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies that there was an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviours in children and adolescents given antidepressants. In October 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered that pharmaceutical companies add a ‘black box’ warning on all antidepressant medication warning of the heightened risk of suicidality.17 There have been several key guidelines, meta-analyses and papers published since the FDA black box warning that have added further information in an attempt to clarify the role of antidepressants in the treatment of depressed adolescents. Despite the increasing amount of information available, it is our contention that the available literature remains limited and at times contradictory about prescribing. A selective review of the key papers is provided with a discussion on the implication for practice-based management of depressed adolescents. The association of antidepressants and suicidal behaviour in adolescents is discussed elsewhere.18 Do antidepressant drugs work at all in adolescent depression? There is universal agreement that tricyclic antidepressants have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. A Cochrane meta-analysis found that there was no difference in the rate of recovery in children and adolescents with depressive disorder between those given tricyclic antidepressants and those given placebo treatments.19 The randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English peer-reviewed journals for the treatment of adolescent or combined adolescent/child depression (n = 14) are shown in Table 1. The majority of the studies were industry-funded and were conducted in North America. Unpublished and non-English-language studies on nefazodone, citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine and mirtazapine have been noted elsewhere.34-37 Fluoxetine is the drug with the most consistent positive response, in three out of the four studies. On the basis of evidence of efficacy from RCTs, the FDA has approved both fluoxetine, in 2003,38 and escitalopram (the active enantiomer of citalopram), in 2009, for use in adolescent depression.39 While seven studies show superiority of drug over placebo, the reported findings from some of the studies have been queried since publication. A study of sertraline by Wagner et al. (2003) that reported positive results had in fact pooled two studies with the same methodology.25 When each of the sertraline studies is taken on its own there is no significance in either study.18 Jureidini (2008) noted that the significant difference between paroxetine and placebo reported by Keller et al. (2001) was found using measures not cited in the original protocol (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression depressed mood item, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia – Lifetime depressed mood item, Clinical Global Impression).40 It is possible that the outcomes reported from each of the RCTs may be influenced by the variables related to the study design, medication compliance, placebo response rate and the nature of the cohort recruited.37, 41-43 The differences between the studies restrict direct comparison of their reported findings. The limitations of single RCTs point us to systematic reviews with meta-analyses that have the capacity to pool data and address the problem of small sample sizes.44 An early meta-analysis (n = 5 RCTs) reported a small effect size for antidepressants over placebo, with suggested negligible clinical benefit.45 Tsapakis et al. (n = 29 RCTs including tricyclics) reported an overall number needed to treat (NNT) of 9, with a higher response rate in adolescents compared with children.46 Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry (n = 12 RCTs)47 and Whittington et al. (n = 5 RCTs)48 reported a modest benefit for fluoxetine over placebo. In summary, these meta-analyses found small effect sizes that have been interpreted as reflecting limited to negligible clinical improvement. The most recent Cochrane review (n = 19 RCTs) of 3335 participants treated with newer antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, mirtazapine, venlafaxine)35 found a small statistically significant difference in response/remission favouring antidepressants over placebo, but this finding was qualified as being not clinically meaningful.35 Other authors came to different conclusions. Bridge et al. (n = 15 RCTs) found in their meta-analysis that the NNT for antidepressants in children and adolescent MDD was 10 but advocated for ‘the cautious and well monitored’ use of antidepressants.37 Other techniques have been used to assess antidepressant efficacy. Gibbons et al. (2012) pooled all the data from each participant in the fluoxetine RCT studies (n = 708) over the first 6 weeks of treatment, arguing this approach was superior to a meta-analysis as it utilised all the data available.49 Gibbons et al. found that using fluoxetine compared with placebo, the NNT for response to treatment was 4.49 Higher response and remission rates were reported for fluoxetine in depressed youth than adults.49 The overall findings suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of fluoxetine and less evidence for that of other antidepressants in the short term. The various complex analyses, in the main, have been confusing, as different authors have argued for exclusion of selected RCTs from analysis depending on their orientation.46, 50, 51 Further, meta-analysis itself is not an exact science and is open to some interpretation depending on which studies are included, the quality of the studies and the nature of the statistical analysis (fixed-effects vs. random-effects regression).37, 52 Some studies that have compared combined cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication treatments to monotherapeutic approaches for adolescent depression have shown differences in the relative efficacy of CBT, antidepressants or combination after 3 months.31, 53 However, there is convergence in efficacy across all the treatments (medication vs. CBT vs. combination) in the subsequent months53, 54 and years.8 In a meta-analysis of five RCTs, antidepressants (predominantly fluoxetine) have been shown to be equivalent to a combination of antidepressant and CBT at 26 and 36 weeks' follow-up.55 These findings challenge the assumption that two treatments are ultimately better than one. In contrast, for adolescents with MDD who do not respond to the initial SSRI, changing to another antidepressant (SSRI or venlafaxine), especially in conjunction with CBT, has been shown to result in an improvement in depressive symptoms in half of patients.56 In this treatment-resistant group the change to a combination of CBT and antidepressant or another antidepressant led to 38.9% achieving remission at 24 weeks.57 RCTs of antidepressant efficacy have typically aimed to examine short-term outcome (2 to 3 months). Adolescent depressive disorder runs a relapsing, remitting course into early adulthood.6 There have been two placebo-controlled studies of children and adolescents with MDD looking at relapse prevention.58, 59 Over 32 weeks' (n = 40) and 6 months' (n = 102) follow-up of patients who remitted from MDD, fewer patients relapsed on fluoxetine than placebo, and those on placebo relapsed more quickly than those on fluoxetine,58, 59 providing preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of fluoxetine in reducing risk of MDD relapse. Kennard et al. conducted a pilot study of adolescents with MDD (n = 46) who had responded to fluoxetine, randomising them to CBT and fluoxetine or fluoxetine only over the next 6 months.60 Those adolescents who were given CBT and fluoxetine were eight times less likely to relapse than those who received medication alone.60 There is early evidence that in the continuation phase of treatment (6 to 12 months after the acute phase), there is a role for antidepressant and possibly CBT prophylaxis to prevent relapse. Depression in children and adolescents is associated with parental depression.61 This association is likely to be mediated by genetic susceptibility; exposure to parental depressive emotions, cognitions and behaviours; and increased familial stresses. Intervention studies to treat depressed parents have largely focused on maternal depression.62 For depressed adolescents whose mothers are concurrently depressed, treating the mother's depression has been shown to improve internalising disorders in their offspring.63 This improvement continues at 12-month follow-up.64 These studies, taken together, point to the importance of looking at the whole family system and not just treating the adolescent in isolation. There are several clinical practice guidelines that incorporate these research findings and expert opinion to assist paediatricians in the management of the depressed adolescent. The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care treatment (GLAD-PC) were published in 2007,65 the beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines were released in 2010,66 and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines were released in 200567 and updated in 2011 without change. The NICE guidelines recommend that children and adolescents with moderate to severe depression should be offered, as first-line treatment, CBT, interpersonal therapy or short-term family therapy of at least 3 months' duration. Antidepressants should only be prescribed if the adolescent has moderate to severe depression, is assessed by a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services tier 2 or 3 professional and is receiving concurrent psychological treatment. The beyondblue guidelines recommend that fluoxetine should be considered for reduction of depressive symptoms in the short term where psychological treatment has failed, is inaccessible or is refused.66 The GLAD-PC guidelines recommend using an SSRI for moderate to severe depression, outlining dosing regiments for six different SSRIs.65 The NICE guidelines appear to be the most conservative in their recommendations and the GLAD-PC the most liberal. The recommendation for the use of antidepressants in the short term by the beyondblue guidelines is in line with the evidence base, which, in the main, has investigated short-term outcomes of depression. A number of factors limit the clinician's ability to apply RCT findings in his or her practice.68 The RCTs described use placebos, are short-term and are not representative of those depressed adolescents who present in the clinician's office. Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry reported that the children and adolescents in RCTs were unlike those who presented for treatment, who were suffering with lower levels of comorbidity and suicidality.47 The paediatrician often sees patients who would be excluded from most of the adolescent depression RCTs. For instance, there is scant information about the assessment of use of antidepressants in those with MDD and developmental disability,69 leaving them therapeutic orphans. Further, the clinician does not have the option of using a placebo. If the likelihood of a short-term response is 61% on an antidepressant,37 where does that leave the prescribing clinician? It is very likely that many clinicians will consider trialling an SSRI. Seligman (1998) has made the point that the aims of clinical trials overlap with those of the practicing clinician, but they are not the same thing. Seligman notes that clinical trials are largely short-term, single-intervention studies, usually focusing on a single outcome (e.g. reduction in depressive symptoms).70 By contrast, clinical work is, in the main, a long-term engagement, involving multiple treatments that are self-correcting.70 The decision to medicate, while guided by the available research, is also directed by the adolescent's severity of symptoms, unique strengths and vulnerabilities, family factors, access to mental health services and individual wishes of the patient and his or her parents. The paediatrician is well placed to integrate all these factors. The treatment guidelines for adolescent depression suggest that the role of antidepressants is as a second-line treatment for moderate to severe depression as part of stepped treatment where there has been inadequate response to psychological therapies. Of the antidepressants, fluoxetine has the strongest evidence of efficacy; however, the evidence is largely short-term. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that fluoxetine can prevent relapse. Tricyclics have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. CBT may be added to an antidepressant; however, evidence of an additive effect is limited. Effectiveness studies are largely unavailable, and treatment response rates may vary in clinical practice. If an adolescent and his or her mother are both depressed, then both are likely to benefit if the mother is the one who takes and responds to an antidepressant.",

      "abstract": "The article describes features of trauma memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including characteristics of unintentional re-experiencing symptoms and intentional recall of trauma narratives. Reexperiencing symptoms are usually sensory impressions and emotional responses from the trauma that appear to lack a time perspective and a context. The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as re-experiencing of warning signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event changed for the worse. Triggers of re-experiencing symptoms include stimuli that have perceptual similarity to cues accompanying the traumatic event. Intentional recall of the trauma in PTSD may be characterised by confusion about temporal order, and difficulty in accessing important details, both of which contribute to problematic appraisals. Recall tends to be disjointed. When patients with PTSD deliberately recall the worst moments of the trauma, they often do not access other relevant (usually subsequent) information that would correct impressions/predictions made at the time. A theoretical analysis of re-experiencing symptoms and their triggers is offered, and implications for treatment are discussed. These include the need to actively incorporate updating information (\"I know now ...\") into the worst moments of the trauma memory, and to train patients to discriminate between the stimuli that were present during the trauma (\"then\") and the innocuous triggers of re-experiencing symptoms (\"now\").",

      "abstract": "In the evaluation of disability resulting from hysteria, conversion or psycho-physiological reactions, consideration should be given to the clinical effects resulting from the disturbed, or actual loss of function upon the physiological homeostasis of the patient, as well as his personal activities on a day-to-day basis. While classical forms of major hysteria are less frequent in occurrence in recent years, the etiological basis of the pattern still is clinically significant. Conversion reactions and psychophysiological reactions affecting various body systems continue to be a part of the spectrum of psychiatric illness seen in active practice. While no organic cause for the symptoms is present, the loss of function, when substantial and persistent, equates with the loss of function resulting from actual organic disease. Not all of these reactions occur in the ‘hysterical personality’, and both social and cultural patterns must be taken into account. In evaluating the severity of an impairment (loss of function) resulting from a functional illness, the psychological and physiological homeostasis of the patient is a crucial consideration. Symptoms derived from purely conscious reactions are seldom associated with actual loss of function.",

      "title": "Psychological parameters of psoriasis",
      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory scaling dermatosis. The marked visible appearance of the lesions have a negative impact on body image that leads to decreased self-esteem, hence seriously compromising the patient's quality of life. The clinical picture critically affects the social well-being of the patient since the disease is commonly misunderstood and feared by the social environment as being contagious. The patient feels stigmatized and this further intensifies their lack of self-confidence and self-esteem. Feelings of shame and guilt increase the tendency toward suicidal ideation. The poor quality of life of psoriatic patients has been associated with excessive alcohol consumption, increased smoking and greater use of tranquilizers, sedatives and antidepressants. As far as mental impairment is concerned, a correlation has been found between psychological stress and the clinical severity of symptoms: the more mentally affected the patient, the more severe the dermatologic lesions. Similarly, stressful life events constitute a major risk for the occurrence and recurrence, exacerbating the severity and duration of the symptoms. Depression and anxiety can worsen the disease or cause resistance to treatment or patient's indifference, which in turn can lead to expensive and prolonged treatment. Not least, the disease itself contributes to anxiety, depression and psychological stress, thus creating a \"vicious circle\" that is difficult to manage. Given that women seem to invest more in their personal appearance than men, it is hardly surprising that female psoriatic patients report higher levels of depression. Similarly, the risk of mental disorders is also higher in younger patients for whom body image plays an equally significant role. The severity of the disease, side effects of therapy and mental disorders are among the causes that have been attributed to sexual dysfunction reported by some psoriatic patients. At the social level, stigma, social rejection, feelings of shame, embarrassment and lack of confidence provoked by the disease often lead to the discontinuation of daily activities and social withdrawal. This review attempts to describe the prevalence of psychological stress and its negative social impact on patients with psoriasis. The recognition and treatment of these psychosocial problems may contribute to improving the quality of life for patients and reduce treatment costs. The collaboration between the psychiatrist and the dermatologist is a fundamental prerequisite toward addressing these issues.",

      "title": "Different Childhood Adversities Are Associated with Different Symptom Patterns in Adulthood",
      "abstract": "A history of childhood adversities has been associated with the pathogenesis of several psychiatric conditions: major depressive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, alcohol/substance dependence, personality disorders [1]. It has therefore been suggested that childhood traumata might be a non-specific risk factor for psychopathology [2].This is in contrast to most psychological models, that postulated a certain specificity between the kind of childhood trauma, the attachment style and adult psychopathology [e.g. [3]].Few studies have dealt with this issue on empirical grounds. It has been reported that patients with a history of maltreatment exhibit greater severity, higher comorbidity, greater risk for suicide and poorer treatment response compared with non-maltreated patients with the same diagnoses [4].Emotional neglect during childhood was reported to be associated with depression, dysthymia and social phobia and with the anhedonic symptoms of depression, whereas sexual abuse in the past was associated with anxious arousal and general distress [5,6].As these findings are scant and not fully consistent, we decided to study the effects of early traumata on adult psychopathology, exploring the hypothesis that different adversities might be associated with different symptom patterns.Operational diagnoses, with their high rate of comorbidity and lack of specificity, might not be an adequate way to explore this topic. It is conceivable that different types of early adversities might produce symptom patterns that range transdiagnostically. Since to our knowledge no study has systematically explored this hypothesis, we assessed the relationship between early adversities (loss, neglect and abuse) and symptoms in a representative sample of psychiatric patients according to a transnosographic perspective.During the period November to December 2010 it was possible to contact and interview 409 consecutive patients admitted, within 1 week of the interview, to all the psychiatric in- and outpatient facilities of Tuscany. A group of 200 people randomly drawn from the general population living in the same catchment area and matched with the psychiatric cases for age, gender and education made up the controls.The adversities of childhood/adolescence were studied by the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA-Q [7]) and by an interview for early trauma widely used in the past [8]. For the purpose of this study early adversities were evaluated as follows: (a) presence of a loss event whenever a death or separation (for 1 year or more) from parents was reported; (b) presence of sexual abuse or physical abuse when the CECA-Q or the interview showed the occurrence of physical and/or sexual abuse; (c) the presence of neglect was based on the CECA-Q scores in the scales 'Mother's Neglect' and 'Father's Neglect' using the proposed cut-off [7].DSM-IV diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders [9]. The symptoms were assessed independently of the diagnoses: the items of several well-known rating scales, combined in a single fully validated instrument [8], were used.Compared with controls, patients as a whole showed an excess of all early life events (below statistical significance only in the case of loss; p value used <0.05). When the patients were divided according to their DSM-IV diagnoses (only diagnoses with at least 30 cases were considered), almost all the main diagnostic groups showed a significantly higher rate of abuse and neglect compared with the control group. An excess of loss events was generally reported, but the significance level was attained only by non-affective psychosis, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. When the diagnostic categories were compared with each other, no significant difference was found.The psychiatric symptoms of the patients who reported the occurrence of no adversity during childhood/early adolescence were compared with those of the cases who reported loss, neglect, sexual abuse or physical abuse. Of the 54 symptoms shown by at least 10% of cases, 17 bore significant associations with early adversities. Six maintained the significance (p < 0.001) after Bonferroni correction.Compared with patients with no early adversity, the patients reporting neglect were characterized by an excess of early awakening [odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = 1.86 (1.06-3.30)], hyporexia [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.13-3.70)], eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 2.87 (1.16-7.06)], suicidal ideation/attempts [OR (95% CI) = 1.83 (1.03-3.53)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 2.09 (1.17-3.74)] and sexual activity [OR (95% CI) = 1.91 (1.08-3.38)], mood-congruent delusions [OR (95% CI) = 2.61 (1.04-6.50)], and a previous history of hyperthymia [OR (95% CI) = 1.87 (1.03-3.38)].Sexual abuse was associated with night terror [OR (95% CI) = 2.46 (1.03-5.69)], recurrent nightmares [OR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.02-3.91)], intrusive memories [OR (95% CI) = 2.96 (1.05-8.34)] and flashbacks of the event [OR (95% CI) = 3.4 (1.16-9.92)], aggressive impulses [OR (95% CI) = 2.96 (1.51-5.82)], hyporexia [OR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.02-3.91)], binge eating [OR (95% CI) = 2.18 (1.07-4.42)], eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 3 (1.02-8)], suicidal ideation/attempts [OR (95% CI) = 2.04 (1.21-4.76)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 2.43 (1.22-4.83)], mood-congruent delusions [OR (95% CI) = 3.41 (1.03-8.96)], and a past history of substance abuse [OR (95% CI) = 3.02 (1.39-6.82)].Physical abuse bore significant associations with eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 3.09 (1.27-7.51)], recurrent nightmares [OR (95% CI) = 3.19 (1.11-9.14)], intrusive memories [OR (95% CI) = 2.63 (1.01-6.84)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 1.9 (1.07-3.67)] and a past history of substance abuse [OR (95% CI) = 2.25 (1.05-4.8)].Loss of parents was associated with a significantly increased risk of having weight loss [OR (95% CI) = 2.54 (1.37-4.59)] and grandiose thoughts [OR (95% CI) = 3.38 (1.54-7.42)].As the symptoms had some level of reciprocal association and the early life events also were not independent of each other, we adopted the stepwise forward conditional method of regression for controlling the multicollinearity. The adjusted ORs confirmed that each type of early adversity was associated with a specific symptom pattern (table 1).A huge number of previous studies already reported that early adversities differentiate psychiatric patients and controls, but failed to distinguish among specific DSM-IV diagnoses [1,2]. The well-known heterogeneity of DSM diagnoses and the high level of comorbidity can account for this. For this reason we chose the 'functional' approach proposed by Van Praag [10] and indeed in the present study early adversities seem to influence differentially specific symptom profiles rather than diagnoses.Retrospective recall may obviously bias the assessment of early adversities. However, the excess of even those early adversities that are reliably retrieved, such as death of parents, renders plausible that also the more subjective accounts retain a sufficient amount of credibility.The present study is one of the first yielding empirical evidence supporting the common psychotherapeutic position that different early adversities are associated with different adult clinical states. While these associations do not warrant a causal link, they suggest that the topic merits being studied from different perspectives rather than by adopting a purely nosological approach.",

      "abstract": "For the clinician caring for patients in some phase of symptomatic HIV disease, patients' current level of adaptation and potential to sustain a sense of well-being are critical. Symptoms of anxiety and depression raise concern, and must be assessed for their severity and enduring qualities. Are these expressions evidence of moods that fluctuate over time even within a given day? Or are they reflective of full-blown syndromes enduring over time? Finally, are these reported and observable symptoms signs of current or imminent psychiatric disorders? Too frequently, episodes of anxiety and depression in persons with life-threatening illness are misdiagnosed where transient moods are given clinical relevance and syndromes are underestimated. Specificity in assessment is needed to derive the most appropriate intervention program. This problem in the context of primary care services to persons with HIV illness can lead to too much concern about temporary distress and minimization of moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression. People with AIDS (PWAs) must cope with multiple complications while anticipating a shortened lifespan. Emotional distress is common and may be organically based, idiopathic, and/or reactive. The relationship of somatic well-being and subjective emotional distress needs attention since the severity of physical debilitation and heightened risk of psychological problems seem to be correlated in this population. Predicting increased anxiety and dysphoric moods at crisis points in the illness draws attention to the role of individuals' cognitive appraisals of their symptoms, judgments of self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies. Symptom severity and perceived control over symptoms are interlocking phenomena capable of influencing emotional distress in these patients.",

Some of them are revealed, described and could be measured by means of Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON 2006.

They became a focus of controversy regarding fragmentation of memory, identity and consciousness, especially regarding amnesia and memory retrieval of traumatic events. It became clear that trauma and dissociation are closely linked, both at the time of trauma and in its aftermath. The very discontinuity of experience brought about by trauma can be reflected in the discontinuity of memory and personal identity. As our understanding of other reactions to trauma led to the formulation of PTSD, recognition grew of a dissociative subtype in the DSM-5 that reflected suppression of trauma-related affect. Neurobiological research on dissociation has demonstrated characteristic activity in the region of the posterior cingulate cortex and a corresponding altered relationship with the prefrontal cortex. Dissociative disorders have been underdiagnosed and disrespected, but despite that they have not disappeared, and continue to be increasingly integrated into mainstream psychiatric and psychological thought.",

      "abstract": "Post-stroke mood and emotional disturbances are frequent and diverse in their manifestations. Among them, post-stroke depression is the best known. Although post-stroke anger (PSA) has been studied relatively less, it can be as frequent as depression. Manifestations of PSA range from overt aggressive behaviors (including hitting or hurting others) to becoming irritable, impulsive, hostile, and less tolerable to family members. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of PSA include neurochemical dysfunction due to brain injury, frustration associated with neurological deficits or unfavorable environments, and genetic predisposition. PSA causes distress in both patients and their caregivers, negatively influences the patient’s quality of life, and increases the burden on caregivers. It can be treated or prevented using various methods, including pharmacological therapies. In addition, anger or hostility may also be a risk or triggering factor for stroke. The hazardous effects of anger may be mediated by other risk factors, including hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The identification of anger as a result or cause of stroke is important because strategic management of anger may help improve the patient’s quality of life or prevent stroke occurrence. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, prevalence, factors or predictors, relevant lesion locations, and pharmacological treatment of PSA. We further describe the current evidence on anger as a risk or triggering factor for stroke.",

      "title": "Chronic unpredictable stress promotes cell-specific plasticity in prefrontal cortex D1 and D2 pyramidal neurons",
      "abstract": "Abstract Exposure to unpredictable environmental stress is widely recognized as a major determinant for risk and severity in neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, and PTSD. The ability of ostensibly unrelated disorders to give rise to seemingly similar psychiatric phenotypes highlights a need to identify circuit-level concepts that could unify diverse factors under a common pathophysiology. Although difficult to disentangle a causative effect of stress from other factors on medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction, a wealth of data from humans and rodents demonstrates that the PFC is a key target of stress. The present study sought to identify a model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) which induces affective behaviors in C57BL6J mice and once established, measure spike firing and the ability to evoke an action potential in mPFC layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons. Adult male mice received 2 weeks of ‘less intense’ stress or 2 or 4 weeks of ‘more intense’ CUS followed by sucrose preference for assessment of anhedonia, elevated plus maze for assessment of anxiety and forced swim test for assessment of depressive-like behaviors. Our findings indicate that more intense CUS exposure results in increased anhedonia, anxiety, and depressive behaviors, while the less intense stress results in no measured behavioral phenotypes. Once a behavioral model was established, mice were euthanized approximately 21 days post-stress for whole-cell patch clamp recordings from layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices. No significant differences were initially observed in intrinsic cell excitability in either region. However, post-hoc analysis and subsequent confirmation using transgenic mice expressing tdtomato or eGFP under control of dopamine D1- or D2-type receptor showed that D1-expressing pyramidal neurons (D1-PYR) in the PrL exhibit reduced thresholds to fire an action potential (increased excitability) but impaired firing capacity at more depolarized potentials, whereas D2-expressing pyramidal neurons showed an overall reduction in excitability and spike firing frequency. Examination of synaptic transmission showed that D1- and D2-PYR in exhibit differences in basal excitatory and inhibitory signaling under naïve conditions. In CUS mice, D1-PYR showed increased frequency of both miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, whereas D2-PYR only showed a reduction in excitatory currents. These findings demonstrate that the intrinsic physiology and synaptic regulation of D1- and D2-PYR subpopulations differentially undergo stress-induced plasticity that may have functional implications for stress-related pathology, and that these adaptations may reflect unique differences in basal properties regulating output of these cells.",

      "abstract": "Harness Suspension Stress (HSS) is defined as the physiological stress resulting from hanging motionless in a harness for a length of time. HSS may produce pain in the legs, numbness, syncope, and has been the subject of debate without much clinical data to support the physiologic explanation for these clinical features. HSS has been reported loosely in peer-reviewed literature. Further, one's predisposition of developing HSS, or subsequent medical ramifications requiring therapy has not been well evaluated. Our knowledge of HSS to this point has been derived mostly from expert opinion and case reports over the last 50 years. A rise in manufacturer development of fall protection equipment, including the use of harnesses, has resulted in increased regulative preventative measures, rescue techniques, and postulations for medical care. Other syndromes have been associated with the effects of HSS, but the constellation of symptoms reported for HSS are inconsistent with any other set of well- established existing medical syndromes, leaving a gap in understanding of the overall etiology and pathogenesis of HSS. This review aims to examine possible factors that may help qualify or quantify a series of measurable signs or symptoms that may establish HSS as its own syndrome, or if pre-dispositional factors may play a role that could be of clinical or practical use.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy on Shyness: Influence of Age",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONShyness may be defined experientially as excessive self-focus characterized by negative self-evaluation that creates discomfort and/or inhibition in social situations and interferes with pursuing one's interpersonal or professional goals. The experience of shyness can occur at any or all of the following levels: cognitive, affective, physiological and behavioural and may be triggered by a wide variety of situational cues (Henderson and Zimbardo, 1998). Among the most typical situations are interactions with authorities and strangers, one on one opposite sex interactions, and unstructured social settings. Subcategories of shyness reflect the degree (i.e., mild social awkwardness to totally inhibiting social phobia) and frequency of experienced shyness and include chronic shyness (self-labeling as shy and the experience of shyness in numerous social situations), situational shyness (the experience of shyness in specific social situations), and shy extroverts (experience anxiety and negative self-evaluation but are publicly outgoing).Shyness, often start in adolescence and is centered on a fear of scrutiny by other people in comparatively small groups (as opposed to crowds), usually leading to avoidance of social situation (Schmidt et al., 1997). According to various statistics, around 40 to 50 percent of the people (and sometimes more) are involved in shyness. Shyness evokes negative effect, which leads to sadness, unhappiness and fearfulness, and tendency to describe oneself as 'shy natured' is associated with low global self esteem and with feelings of low self worth in several domains of the self (Crozier, 1995). Shy adolescents tended to be lower in self-esteem, more introverted, and more anxious than their non-shy counterparts (Lawrence and Bennett, 1992). Shy individuals also tend to lack confidence (Crozier, 1982), and express larger perceived skill deficits compared to non-shy individuals (Jackson et al., 1997). A common observation in virtually all shyness research is that the consequences of shyness are deeply troubling. A general observation in most of the shyness research is that the consequences of shyness are deeply troubling shyness leads to higher levels of anxiety (D'Souza, 2003), fear (D'Souza, Gowda and Gowda, 2006), depression and loneliness (Somesha and D'Souza, 2008, 2009).Researchers in India and abroad have proposed several treatment approaches to shyness from medication to life skills intervention to psychotherapy. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) theory is a method to understand and treat dysfunctional emotions and behaviors. It is a cognitive-behavioral approach that posits that inappropriate behaviors result not from an event but rather from irrational beliefs. REBT asserts that irrational beliefs lead to unhealthy negative emotions and behaviors, such as rage and guilt (Jensen, 2008). The present study is aimed at finding out the effectiveness of REBT on shyness among early and late adolescents in India.METHODSampleA large sample of adolescents (N=1200) between 12-18 years was screened for Shyness Assessment Test (SAT) and the samples who had high levels of shyness (scores more than 72) were selected. Next, the researcher selected 96 adolescents randomly and assigned them for the intervention of the study, 48 as experimental group and 48 students as control group. There were 24 early and 24 late adolescents in each group. The experimental group was administered REBT, while the control group was not given any specific intervention.ToolThe Shyness Assessment Test (SAT) was developed by D'Souza (2006) of Maharaja's College, University of Mysore. It consisted of 54 items and requires the subject to indicate his/her response by marking YES, NO or CAN'T SAY. The items in the test pertained to three domains of shyness-Cognitive/Affective, Physiological and Action oriented. Item analysis of the scale using SPSS program resulted in Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0. …",

MS is a major cause of neurological disability among the middle-aged and is an important condition cared for in general practice. Among the physical symptoms seen are fatigue, focal neurological deficits and both sexual and sphincter dysfunction. It is also recognised that psychiatric symptoms play a role in the disease course. These may be owing to the direct effects of demyelination, the emotional reaction to this illness, a poor adjustment to chronic illness or the use of steroids. Transient mood changes, such as anxiety and irritability, are experienced by two-thirds of patients in any year, while major depressive criteria are met in one-third of patients.1 Other mood disturbances less commonly seen are euphoria, mania, and pathological laughing or crying.",

      "title": "POST–SPINAL CORD INJURY PAIN STATES",
      "abstract": "Pain, in contrast to motor deficit, is rarely the main cause of functional disability in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). It frequently occurs, however, in conjunction with disabling motor, autonomic, and urinary tract problems. It is estimated that there are more than 200,000 patients in the United States with SCI. 38 It is probable that more than a half of all SCI patients suffer from pain. 6 These numbers reflect the overall magnitude of this problem. The severity and persistence of pain associated with SCI are, however, of greater significance than its prevalence. It is not unusual for these patients to experience pain for decades because their longevity approaches normal life expectancy owing to early interventions and rehabilitative measures. 40 The lack of effective treatment for SCI pain causes these patients great frustration because in addition to long-term motor disability, they must endure intractable pain. This article first discusses acute pains resulting from spinal injury (Table 1). The remainder of the article concentrates on chronic pains that either appear immediately or sometime after SCI and continue for more than 6 months. It is important to recognize that after 3 to 6 months, the condition of the patient's spinal cord stabilizes, and neurologic dysfunction is no longer considered chronic but rather is referred to as a permanent post-SCI neurologic condition. Pain can appear at any time after SCI (i.e., in the acute stage, during recovery, or in the stable phase). In addition, some pain syndromes are found to be related to complications of SCI. The term pain is used generically throughout the article, although it sometimes may denote more than one type of pain. Referrals to pain generally include dysesthesia because it is difficult to distinguish between these conditions before considering a detailed description of the patient's complaint, including its distribution as well as neurologic findings. 7 Nociceptive versus neurogenic pain (see the articles by Sorkin, and Yaksh and Chaplan) is presented followed by a discussion regarding central pain syndrome, which is treated separately for the purpose of this article. Cauda equina injury is a pure root/nerve injury and does not include primary spinal cord lesion. It is, however, common to include cauda equina injury in discussion of SCI pain. 15, 22, 54 This article also includes discussion about cauda equina injury for several reasons: It is caused by spinal column injury, it may occur concomitantly with conus medullaris injury, and its associated pain is similar to so-called transitional zone SCI pain.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that cognitive and behavioral interventions have enduring effects that reduce risk for subsequent symptom return following treatment termination. These enduring effects have been most clearly demonstrated with respect to depression and the anxiety disorders. It remains unclear whether these effects are a consequence of the amelioration of the causal processes that generate risk or the introduction of compensatory strategies that offset them and whether these effects reflect the mobilization of cognitive or other mechanisms. No such enduring effects have been observed for the psychoactive medications, which appear to be largely palliative in nature. Other psychosocial interventions remain largely untested, although claims that they produce lasting change have long been made. Whether such enduring effects extend to other disorders remains to be seen, but the capacity to reduce risk following treatment termination is one of the major benefits provided by the cognitive and behavioral interventions with respect to the treatment of depression and the anxiety disorders.",

Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of disability, although this aspect of disability in chronic pain disorders is often ignored. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of disability, and the rate of progression to disability in patients with chronic pain. Work disability in lower socioeconomic groups is associated with issues of physical work demands and work flexibility (ie, the ability to control the pace of work, take unscheduled breaks or engage in modified work). Workplace interventions, particularly in the subacute phase, that are geared to workers′ limitations offer the best opportunity to reduce the current burden of disability. Where such work modifications are not available, disability will be problematic.",

      "title": "Reactions to stressful experiences",
      "abstract": "In biological terms, stress literally means a force from the outside world acting upon an individual, and is a phenomenon we have all experienced. The term ‘stress’ was first used in the 1930s by the endocrin­ologist Hans Selye to describe the responses of la­boratory animals to various stimuli. Originally, Selye meant ‘stress’ to be the response of an organism to a perceived threat or ‘stressor’, but the term is now used to mean the stimulus rather than the response in some cases. When presented with a stressor of any type, everyone will produce a reaction to that stress, and this is a normal physiological event. However, if the reac­tion is prolonged, too intense, or atypical in some way, stress can become abnormal and cause problems. Stressful events, even when reacted to normally, are important contributors to the causes of many kinds of psychiatric disorder. In this chapter, we consider those psychiatric disorders that are specific reactions to stressful experiences. These may occur independently or alongside other psychiatric conditions and include: … ● acute stress reactions: short- term disorders after stressful events; ● post- traumatic stress disorder: a disorder following exceptionally severe stress; ● adjustment disorders: conditions occurring after a change in life circumstances; ● grief reactions: the normal and abnormal responses to bereavement; ● reactions to special kinds of acute stress: for example, traffic accidents, war, earthquakes, etc… For all these conditions, an identifiable stressor is a necessary but not always sufficient factor in its aetiology. GPs encounter the vast majority of patients with stress disorders who present to the health services, but all clinicians will see these patients in their clinical specialties. The reasons for this are threefold: … 1 Acute physical illness and its treatment are stressful. 2 Chronic illness or disability can result in substantial changes in life circumstances. 3 Clinicians treat people involved in other kinds of stressful experiences…. Everyone reacts to stress differently, and what consti­tutes a stressful event is therefore highly subjective. However, there are certain situations that are likely to be experienced as stressful by anyone. The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale is a list of 43 life events which predispose to stress- related illnesses, weighted ac­cording to their respective probability of doing so.",

      "abstract": "The lack of “fit” between legal and medical concepts is perhaps best shown in the psychiatric disability of injured workmen. In the particular case discussed in this article, the problem is illustrated (1) in the long-standing preexistence of organic brain disease over many years, (2) in the occurrence of a heart attack from which the claimant recovered in “physical” terms. The heart attack forced a break in his employment and made his previously subclinical disability obvious to employer, wife, and the claimant himself. The resulting disability featured depression, anhedonia, and loss of identity, thus becoming primarily psychiatric in nature. No one of these disorders is “causally related” as a single entity; the problem is the outcome of a cumulative stress in a person made highly vulnerable through prior deterioration. Of particular import is the demonstration of “context-dependence”: workers depend for their own sense of identity and responsibility upon their occupation, and the loss of work becomes itself a “causal” factor.",

This psychological phenomenon can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and complicated grief. Survivor’s guilt is described as the manifestation of tension, distress, or solitude that is triggered by a celebration of life, references to the deceased, and expressions of sympathy. Survivor’s guilt is difficult to treat, and the treatment will depend on the severity of the patient’s symptoms and the individual’s specific needs. This symptom is often overlooked, as it gets grouped into the broader recognized disorder of PTSD. It has been studied within various contexts, including instances of multiple causality, bereaved populations, and HIV-positive men.",

Rather, they fit into a third category--those with the \"tired person\" syndrome. The essential feature of this syndrome is the decrease in self-esteem that follows the real or perceived loss of the ability to work productively. The decrease in self-esteem triggers anxiety, which may be so severe as to approach a panic state. The patient then becomes increasingly disabled or has increasing physical symptoms and enters a vicious cycle culminating in debility. Treatment is aimed at the physician's accepting and legitimizing the very real loss that the patient perceives in order to help him or her become comfortably dependent.",

Psychopharmaka können adjuvant herangezogen werden, wobei nur der Serotoninwiederaufnahmehemmer Fluoxetin über eine Zulassung bei Minderjährigen mit depressiven Störungen verfügt. Zweite Wahl sind Sertralin und Citalopram. Wegen des Off-label-Gebrauchs sind Aufklärungs- und Einwilligungspflicht der Erziehungsberechtigten besonders zu berücksichtigen. Prognostisch ungünstige Faktoren sind ein früher Beginn der Erkrankung, Komorbiditäten in jungem Alter, genetische Belastung, depressive Erkrankung der Mutter, Trennung der Eltern bei unter 10-jährigen Kindern und unzulängliche Sozialisation.",

However, if the stressor was perceived and the stress reaction started, alcohol does not realize the stress-protective action, but rather increases stress due to the deterioration of coping strategies and cognitive functions. It was elucidated that in the chronic course of alcohol dependence, the negative consequences of alcohol abuse come to the fore, which in turn becomes an additional factor of distress.",

Patients have to be back at their baseline functional level once the disorder has resolved. This is a heterogeneous group of patients who have either a disorder similar to schizophrenia or something closer to a mood disorder. Objectives To analyze clinical, psychopathological and epidemiological characteristics of schizophreniform disorder and also review causes, incidence, prevalence, diagnostic, therapeutic tools and the importance of maintaining the treatment, because of the abandonment of the treatment, which is a predictor of relapses. Methods A review of the main impact literature concerning schizophreniform disorder is done during the last five years: prevalence, incidence, pathogenesis and its relationship with other psychiatric disorders encoded in DSM-V are studied. Results The etiology is unknown. Psychotic symptoms can be treated with antipsychotics for 3 to 6 months. They usually respond faster than patients with schizophrenia (75% vs 20% respond within 8 days). Conclusions The disease has a favorable prognosis, and has similarities with mood disorders. However, some data suggest a close relationship to schizophrenia. In support of the relationship with mood disorders, patients have more affective symptoms and a better outcome than patients with schizophrenia. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Psychiatric collaboration in the diagnostic work-up is, then, highly desirable. Certain empirical and thematic psychological tests may provide further presumptive evidence for diagnosis. Although histrionic, repressive, and immature personality traits may tend to correlate with conversion reactions, they have not been found to be consistently associated and are, therefore, unreliable criteria for diagnosis.",

Developmental stammering, regardless of country or language, affects one per cent of adult populations. Exacerbation by the stress of adult conversation or public speaking contrasts sharply with normal flow during singing, acting or conversation with children. Alterations in regional cerebral blood flow suggest that there are underlying differences in sensorimotor function in developmental stammerers whose symptoms commonly appear during the period of intensive language acquisition around the third and fourth year. Emotional tensions may exacerbate the disturbance, but equally psychological growth is adversely affected by the handicap. Abnormal motor control is confirmed by the exaggerated activity in the right hemisphere. The normal sequence of articulatory programming and motor preparation for single word reading is reversed. Absence of activation over the left auditory cortex supports the notion of impaired or diminished auditory feedback in the self-monitoring of speech seen in normal brains. Subcortical abnormalities are a feature of both developmental and acquired stammering.",

We report on a 9 month-old infant with myoclonic attacks, which consisted of frequent clusters of up to 10 symmetric jerks affecting mainly the arms and the head occurring as reflex responses to unexpected auditory stimuli. There was no family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions. Ictal EEG demonstrated a typical 3 Hz spike-wave pattern, while there were no abnormalities, either in wakefulness or during sleep. The neurodevelopmental examination was unremarkable and MRI of the brain was normal. The attacks disappeared 3 weeks after initiating sodium valproate, and have not reappeared since then (follow-up 3 years and 3 months); today, at 4 years of age, the patient has normal psycho-motor development. RMEI should be considered as an age-dependent, idiopathic, generalized epileptic syndrome with an apparently good prognosis[Published with video sequences].",

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging: the adaptive mechanisms in migraine",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a primary brain dysfunction subtended by an episodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Although migraine attacks are clinically welldefined, the underlying pathophysiology of the more complex migraine scenario is largely unknown. Functional brain changes, that occur because of repeated migraine attacks, may be explained through a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model. The fundamental assumption is that “the brain is a central organ of stress” [1], able to detect stressful or potentially stressful situations and react in form of behavioural and/or physiologic responses. These brain responses, mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, could be either adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, allostasis is the ability to protect the body through adaptation [2]. Contrariwise, the allostatic load and overload, resulting from repeated stress and/or allostasis [3], refers to the wear and tear on the systems that normally support adaptation. Compelling evidence suggests that the brain of migraine patients is significantly different from healthy controls. Some of these differences are related to abnormal cortical activity during painful stimulations, suggesting an “adaptive” response observed in the course of moderate or high noxious trigeminal stimulations. Conversely, other differences relate to abnormality in responses that should be adaptive but become impaired or maladaptive, such as altered brainstem processing. More recently, a decreased functional connectivity was demonstrated within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) in patients with migraine without and with aura in the absence of clinically relevant executive deficits. FPN represents the neural substrate of executive functions and FPN functional abnormalities might be a part of a complex cascade that terminates in a migraine attack. Specifically, FPN functional connectivity changes could underlie a defective executive functioning in which high-demanding conditions cannot be correctly processed and solved by patients with migraine, escalating the brain adaptive response, likely resulting in a risk factor for headache attacks. In conclusion, we believe that in migraine an internal state of dysregulation creates an allostatic load with maladaptive consequences on brain, behaviour, physiological regulation and systemic physiology that progress in a feedforward cascade. Thus, we suggest that migraine should be considered a brain disease and not simply a recurrent acute pain syndrome.",

A correlation has also been established between the degree of social stress and an individual's use of medical services. However, the majority of people do not respond to stress in these ways. Social supports (e.g. a caring family) seem to be an important protective factor against the effects of stress. Other mtethods of protection (meditation, relaxation response or learning specific coping skills) are also important, but have been little studied.

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

They examine the relationship of endogenous/melancholic symptoms to other clinical features, treatment response, selected laboratory tests, consistency across episodes, family history, and particular courses of illness.Melancholic symptom features are predictive of a positive response to ECT and to tricyclic antidepressants in the severely ill. Key features include psychomotor retardation, unreactive mood, pervasive anhedonia, and distinct quality of mood. Melancholic features are associated with shorter REM latency and/or nonsuppression of cortisol during the dexamethasone suppression test. Depressive episodes that are not melancholic may take on melancholic features with repetition and passage of time in some individuals. Once melancholic features are present, it is unclear whether they repeat across subsequent episodes. Melancholic features are not uniquely associated with a positive family history of depression per se, but they may be especially associated with a family history of severe depression.The available evidence suggests some clinical utility and some (albeit not entirely consistent) validity for the concept of melancholic features. Consequently, DSM-IV will retain the designation \"with melancholic features,\" return to the shorter DSM-III feature listing, and broaden the designation by requiring either unreactive mood or pervasive anhedonia but not both. Further research on this subgroup is indicated.",

Annually, pain is estimated to burden the U.S. economy with $100 billion in direct costs and $61 billion in productivity losses. These losses, which amount to a mean of 4.6 hours weekly, are largely due to diminished performance at work.1 Perhaps more significant, but more difficult to quantify, is the emotional distress and diminished quality of life that pain inflicts on individuals and their loved ones.\n\nWhat Is Pain? \n\nPain, as defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain is “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.”2 Thus, pain is an experience that comprises a physical sensory component and an affective cognitive component. The physical element involves a nociceptive, neuropathic, or inflammatory stimulus that is transmitted via the spinal cord to the thalamus and then to areas of the cerebral cortex, where it is perceived. Acute pain serves a biological purpose as an alert to potential, immediate, or ongoing injury.\n\nChronic pain is pathologic, serves no biological purpose, and can result from peripheral sensitization, in which processes (such as changes in gene expression in the dorsal root ganglia) augment the synthesis of various peripheral nociceptors. In turn, inputs to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord are amplified, leading to activation of N -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and subsequent …",

      "title": "Hot off the press: <scp>MRI</scp> sensitivity for transient global amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an idiopathic acute neurological disorder that presents with sudden onset anterograde memory loss. It was first described as a syndrome in 1956 by Courjon and Guyotat1 and also by Bender.2 Fisher and Adams formally described TGA in 1964.3 The usual presentation is a patient between 50 and 70 years of age who is cognitively and neurologically intact but asking repetitive questions and unable to form new memories. Symptoms are short-lived and resolve within 24 h. The incidence has been reported as 23.5 per 100,000 people per year and is more common in people who get migraine headaches.4, 5 TGA is often precipitated by physical or emotional stressors, pain, the Valsalva maneuver, hot or cold water immersion, or sexual intercourse.6 The criterion standard of TGA diagnosis combines seven clinical criteria: the attack is witnessed, there is clear anterograde amnesia, the absence of other neurological symptoms during the attack, the absence of abnormal neurological examination findings, memory loss is less than 24 h, there are no epileptic features or history of same, and there is no recent head injury.7 The workup of TGA can include laboratory testing, EEG, ECG, echocardiography, and advanced neuroimaging. This is a systematic review of observational studies of TGA. It included adult patients with a diagnosis of TGA based on existing clinical criteria who were evaluated with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at varying time intervals (e.g., 0–12 h, 12–24 h) after symptom onset. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of DW-MRI in diagnosis of TGA. DW-MRI had low sensitivity for TGA early after symptom onset, but the sensitivity increased over time. The authors concluded that obtaining a DW-MRI in patients with a clinical diagnosis of TGA in the acute setting is likely a low-yield test. This was a good quality systematic review with a relevant diagnostic question, a detailed search strategy, and appropriate assessment of primary studies for common forms of bias. The major limitations of the included studies were the lack of precision (i.e., wide confidence intervals [CIs]) and high heterogeneity for estimates of DW-MRI sensitivity in diagnosing TGA. Heterogeneity as measured by the I2 test was very high at 72%–96% for most measured time points after symptom onset. Another limitation is that all studies included in this systematic review were observational in nature, with no randomized trials allocating patients to any time frame. Furthermore, although there were almost 1700 patients included in this review, there were still very few patients in some of the time points at which MRI was performed. This study also suffered from partial verification bias, also known as referral or workup bias. This occurs when only a certain set of patients who underwent the index test are verified by the reference standard. In this case, only those who met the clinical criteria for TGA had a DW-MRI performed, while patients who did not meet clinical criteria did not have an MRI. This could increase the overall sensitivity reported in the study. Finally, to get an accurate measure of sensitivity and specificity, we need a criterion standard to measure against. TGA is a clinical diagnosis, and the criterion standards used were the defined clinical criteria for the disease. This may be a somewhat uncertain criterion standard. Furthermore, if the criterion standard is clinical, the bedside physician already has access to the criterion standard diagnosis, and it is reasonable to ask what value an MRI could possibly add. Overall, 23 studies with a total of 1688 patients met inclusion criteria. All studies were case series of adult patients who were diagnosed with TGA clinically and who underwent DW-MRI. In the first 12 h from symptom onset, sensitivity of DW-MRI is 15.6%. Sensitivity improves thereafter to ranges as high as 83%, but there are very wide CIs for all point estimates and significant heterogeneity between studies. The Table 1 summarizes sensitivity of DW-MRI as a function of time interval from symptom onset. This study emphasizes the value of clinical criteria in the diagnosis of TGA and the low yield of DW-MRI testing. This is valuable information as it will reduce the unnecessary use of an expensive and time-consuming test in the acute setting. It is possible but unlikely that future prospective and randomized trials will change this. @shawnkdowling: Assuming there are no red flags, I do some basic labs and non-contrast CT head. I'd never considered ordering a DW-MRI and glad I do not need to based on this study. I typically consult neuro if the amnesia has not resolved at 12 h. @iwwalker: Textbook TGA does not need a neuro consult so consulting early likely keeps them unnecessarily in the ED for that, but cannot send them home until resolved regardless. If TGA is going on and on, I would also question the diagnosis, thus the referral. @Kapur_AK: Similar approach here. Our neurologists suggest we refer all as outpatients, which I'm okay with doing. I refer atypical or prolonged presentations in the ED (closer to 4–6 h). Ultimately the conclusion of emergency physicians weighing in on Twitter was not to order MRIs, while outpatient neurology consultation practices were variable. Clinical criteria remain the criterion standard in diagnosis of transient global amnesia. Early imaging with DW-MRI is a low-yield test and should not be performed in the emergency department. The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.",

This condition may be differentiated from acute pain on the basis of biological finality, pathogenic mechanisms, autonomic reactions, affective and behavioural components but most of all of the therapeutic goals. It is important to remind that the experience of pain is the result of at least three interactive neuro-psychological determinants viz. the sensory-discriminative, the affective-motivational and the cognitive-evaluative systems. For this reason, when pain becomes treatment resistant, it is important to complete the usual diagnostic approach by an evaluation of pain as a phenomenon and to abandon a strictly \"peripheral\" model.

Psychological assessment of pain should focus on the role of psychological processes in the multifactorial causation of the illness causing the pain, notably their role in illness-proneness in general. Also, iatrogenic psychological distress, associatively precipitated psychological conflict and illness-perpetuating psychological processes should be looked for.

      "abstract": "The brain reciprocally communicates with the rest of the body via neural, endocrine, immune, and other systems. This is crucial for coordinating the complex behavioral and physiological responses needed to cope with the many challenges of life. The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is a key brain structure involved in assessing rewards and threats, as well as activating appropriate responses. This is a dynamic process that depends on evolving needs and challenges. Important challenges include illness or injury. These typically involve inflammation and pain, which evoke neuroinflammatory processes in the brain to drive sickness behaviours. In the short term, sickness behaviours are considered adaptive, as they promote convalescence (e.g. low mood; lethargy, fatigue, social withdrawal), and enhanced threat appraisal (e.g. anxiety) to combat increased risk/vulnerability associated with sickness. Chronic inflammation, however, appears to remodel the system to inappropriately activate threat-coping responses, resulting in depressive and/or anxious phenotypes. These mood disorders are particularly pronounced in diseases and disorders associated with gut dysfunction, which feature chronic inflammation and altered ACC function. We propose that chronic inflammation remodels ACC physiology such that it errantly predicts heightened danger based on a mental model (a.k.a ‘schema’) of the world. This evokes chronic activation of threat-coping systems, including endocrine signaling (e.g. adrenaline), and anxiety. Inflammation can be driven by brain systems involving ACC, leading to a feedback-cycle that self-reinforces pathological states. This theory accounts for a wealth of clinical and preclinical data that implicate the ACC in disorders of mood and gastrointestinal function, and reveals a key player in the gut-brain axis that may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) differs from other anxiety disorders in that experience of a traumatic event is necessary for the onset of the disorder. The condition runs a longitudinal course, involving a series of transitional states, with progressive modification occurring with time. Notably, only a small percentage of people that experience trauma will develop PTSD. Risk factors, such as prior trauma, prior psychiatric history, family psychiatric history, peritraumatic dissociation, acute stress symptoms, the nature of the biological response, and autonomic hyperarousal, need to be considered when setting up models to predict the course of the condition. These risk factors influence vulnerability to the onset of PTSD and its spontaneous remission. In the majority of cases, PTSD is accompanied by another condition, such as major depression, an anxiety disorder, or substance abuse. This comorbidity can also complicate the course of the disorder and raises questions about the role of PTSD in other psychiatric conditions. This article reviews what is known about the emergence of PTSD following exposure to a traumatic event using data from clinical studies.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines on cognitive impairment in bipolar disorders – Assessment and management",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Bipolar disorder (BD) affects about 0.5% of the Indian population.[1] Individuals with BD experience residual symptoms between episodes and manifest significant functional and cognitive impairments, even during remission. Patients with BD show notable cognitive impairment across all clinical states, including euthymia, even when potential confounding factors like demographic variables, medication effects, and residual depressive symptoms are controlled for.[2] Neurocognitive deficits are not only a persistent aspect of the illness but also postulated to be a fundamental primary characteristic, rather than a result of the mood state or medication.[3] A significant and widespread neurocognitive deficit reportedly exists even before the first onset of mood symptoms, persists through various phases, and often deteriorates as the illness progresses.[4–6] Cognitive functioning is a key predictor of occupational functioning in BD and may exert a greater influence than other clinical factors. Considering the widespread and negative psychosocial impact of cognitive dysfunction in the illness, it is crucial to utilize appropriate cognitive measures to enhance our understanding of the nature, severity, and correlates of cognitive deficits in the illness and to develop effective therapeutic strategies to address this cognitive impairment in BD. PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES A thorough literature search was conducted using the key words/MeSH terms neurocognition, cognitive function, cognitive deficits OR executive functions OR working memory, cognitive domains AND bipolar disorder, mania, and bipolar depression. The 1643 articles that were returned were scrutinised for relevance. In addition, the Medline search returned about 63 systematic reviews and 46 meta-analyses on the search terms neurocognition and bipolar disorder. The articles were then screened for relevance on the title and abstract. The ones that were more recent were included in the review on the understanding that they would include the previous articles. Search for Indian literature using the same search terms returned about 30 articles, most of which have been included in this guideline. Weightage was given to meta-analysis where available. The manuscript has been organised in a manner that would provide good flow for the reader, including what is the evidence available including social cognition, what assessments are possible, time taken for each assessment, what are the treatment options investigated and which of these are feasible in clinical practice. A flow chart is incorporated to highlight the same. COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN BD – EVIDENCE SO FAR To understand cognition in BD, let us try to answer a few questions that commonly arise when we talk about cognition in this group of patients. Are cognitive deficits present in BD? Many studies have supplemented the clinical observation that not all BD patients have cognitive deficits. Three distinct cognitive subgroups have been identified in BD subjects in remission – those with intact cognition, those with selective cognitive impairment, and those with global cognitive impairment (Burdick, 2014; Lima, 2019).[7,8] These differences remained over a 5-year longitudinal course, thereby further highlighting that cognitive deficits in BD could represent a significantly heterogeneous group (Elhrich, 2022)[9] and the cognition remained intact in the high-performance group relative to healthy subjects. Cognitive heterogeneity is now being increasingly recognized, and the cognitive trajectory of BD is a subject of scholastic debate and enquiry (Van Rheenan, 2020).[10] Despite this, there is a consensus that not only the performance on neurocognitive tasks in nearly every major domain is disrupted during manic, depressed, or mixed phases of BD but also the deficits persist even in euthymia. Studies have noted that in euthymic BD, domain-specific deficits have been demonstrated in attention, verbal learning memory, and executive functions.[11] Attention is a complex neurocognitive domain with several subcomponents and is essential to all higher cognitive functions. Sustained attention is impaired in BD in all phases of the illness, and these impairments do not remit completely during euthymia. Selective attention deficits present in the acute episodes also persist during euthymia.[12] Verbal immediate and delayed recall is also impaired in remitted BD. Executive function deficits are the most consistent neurocognitive deficit reported in euthymic BD in different aspects of executive function like planning, set-shifting, cognitive control, and verbal fluency.[12–14] In summary, multiple investigations have consistently provided evidence of neurocognitive deficits in individuals with BD across all clinical stages, including euthymia. These impairments have been found to have moderate to high effect sizes. Deficits in verbal memory and certain aspects of executive functioning seem to be more pronounced compared to other cognitive domains. The findings of various studies are summarized below [Table 1].Table 1: Summary of studies on cognitive deficits in BDAt what stages are cognitive deficits noted? At what stage in the course of the illness do cognitive deficits occur, does illness progression has an impact on the progression of the cognitive deficits, and what is the potential for intervention at each stage are some questions that are of clinical relevance. Some studies (individual and reviews/meta-analyses) have evaluated cognitive deficits in the different stages of BD and the correlation between illness progression and the progression of cognitive deficits. The individual studies are mostly cross-sectional though longitudinal studies would be more informative. Most of these studies have reported that cognitive deficits are present from the very early stages, that is, even in the first-degree unaffected family members also, and these are more pronounced after the onset of the first episode. A recent study by Reddy et al., 2023 done at NIMHANS also showed similar results.[19] A study done at NIMHANS[20] that evaluated cognition across stages of BD also noted that those with a higher number of episodes, especially more than three manic episodes, show higher deficits than those with one or two episodes. Some of these studies are summarized below [Table 2].Table 2: Summary of studies on cognitive deficits across stages of BDAre there distinct cognitive subgroups of BD? Some of the studies have attempted to investigate this question. Bora (2018) examined the impact of a history of psychotic characteristics and full manic episodes on neurocognitive performance. The results showed that those with a history of psychotic symptoms and individuals with a history of full manic episodes, that is, BD-I, had slightly more severe cognitive deficits. BD-I significantly underperformed BD-II in global cognition, verbal memory, and processing speed. Psychotic BD was associated with significantly impaired cognition in global cognition verbal memory processing speed, EF speed, EF accuracy, working memory, and social cognition.[26] Studies have also attempted to see the difference between BD I and BD II, and they reported similar cognitive profiles. A recent systematic review reported similar cognitive profiles in BD I and BD II.[27] Lima et al.in 2019 did a hierarchical cluster analysis to investigate the presence of discrete neurocognitive subgroups using a neurocognitive battery as the basis for classification. The Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment (COBRA) and Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) were employed to evaluate self-reported cognitive challenges and the extent of functional impairment. The study delineated three distinct subgroups: The first comprised individuals with normal cognitive function (43.5%), the second included individuals with specific cognitive impairments (33.3%), and the third encompassed individuals with overall cognitive impairments (23.3%). The intact group had significantly greater levels of schooling and higher estimated IQ compared to both the generally and selectively affected groupings. Furthermore, they received a diagnosis of BD at an earlier age and underwent their initial hospitalization at a younger age than individuals with general cognitive impairment. Evidence supports the presence of a spectrum of severity ranging from patients without any impairment to those with significant cognitive dysfunction. Patients in the intact group exhibit a greater level of cognitive reserve compared to the other two groups. Nevertheless, they also encountered cognitive grievances and a certain level of functional debilitation.[8] These findings indicate that it is crucial to utilize a combination of tools, such as objective and subjective cognitive measures along with functioning instruments, in order to fully evaluate patients with BD. The above studies suggest that we definitely need a better understanding of the determinants of cognitive deficits in BD patients. Let us discuss these determinants in further detail.DETERMINANTS OF COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN BDASSESSMENT OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS The assessment of cognitive deficits can be outlined in two steps: Screening for cognitive deficits Evaluation of cognitive deficits Like schizophrenia, where researchers have developed cognitive batteries like the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), researchers working on cognition in BD have developed screening tools that can identify cognitive deficits in BD. Before we screen the patient for cognitive deficits, assessment of the baseline IQ is very important. Screen patients when they are in remission (currently euthymic). Clinicians can use the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence® - Second Edition (WASI®-II) to assess the IQ. The WASI is intended to provide estimates of verbal and performance intelligence consistent with previous Wechsler tests in addition to measuring general, or full scale, intelligence.[36] The screening tools that have been validated for use in BD are listed below [Table 3].Table 3: Screening Tools for Cognitive Deficits in Bipolar DisorderAmong the computer-based tests, THINC-IT takes less time (15 minutes) when compared to ICAT (35 min), but THINC-IT is validated only for bipolar depression and has poor psychometric quality, so ICAT is a better screening instrument. Among the paper–pencil screening tests, COBRA takes 10 minutes and is a self-report-based test, whereas SCIP takes 15 minutes is a clinician-assessed, performance-based tool. The International Society of Bipolar Disorder (ISBD) formulated a task force to develop a consensus statement about the neurocognitive deficits in BD. This team reviewed various available cognitive batteries and the individual domain tests for their utility in BD.[41] ISBD Battery for Assessment of Neurocognition (ISBD-BANC) outlines the cognitive domains and neuropsychological tests relevant to BD. The NIMHANS neuropsychological battery which is validated for use in the Indian population has tests that can be used to assess the same cognitive domains [Table 4].Table 4: Proposed Cognitive Battery for Bipolar DisorderOut of the other cognitive batteries that could be relevant in BD but warrant further studies include: Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT) for testing inhibitory control, Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery intradimensional ⁄ extradimensional (CANTAB-IDED) set-shifting task, Tower of London (and variants) for planning, inhibition, and working memory, Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) for decision-making/risk-taking, and Theory of Mind Advanced Test for Theory of Mind. Keefe et al. group also working on cognition in BD adopted the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BAC-S) scale for assessing cognition in BD and called it Brief Assessment of Cognition in Affective Disorders (BAC-A). This battery has been studied extensively and validated for assessing cognition in BD patients.[42] The tests included in the BAC-A battery are as mentioned in the below table [Table 5].Table 5: BAC –A SubtestsRecommendation: If cognitive impairment is suspected during clinical evaluation, initially screen and/or monitor the patient's cognitive performance using one of four instruments (THINC-it, ICAT, COBRA, and SCIP). If deficits are identified, then we can proceed to the next level of assessment, choosing between BAC-A and ISBD-BANC [Figure 1].Figure 1: Algorithm for the type of tests to be used for screening and assessing cognitive deficits in BDBAC-A takes 45 minutes, clinician-assessed, performance-based tests, and ISBD-BANC takes around 90 minutes, clinician-assessed, performance-based tests. Since BAC-A assesses a component of affective memory and emotional inhibition, also takes lesser time, it might be more feasible in clinical settings. SOCIAL COGNITION IN BIPOLAR DISORDER Social cognition (SC) is a discipline that seeks to understand how brain function facilitates the cognitive processes that underlie social behavior. It encompasses a range of intricate processes that enable us to engage in adaptive social interactions. These processes include representing internal bodily states, self and other knowledge, interpersonal motivations, and the ability to respond appropriately to socioemotional information.[43] The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has categorized five fundamental areas within this concept: Theory of Mind (ToM), Social Perception, Social Knowledge, Attribution Bias, and Emotion Processing (EP).[44] The theory of mind pertains to the capacity to comprehend and assign mental states, including beliefs, wants, and intentions, to oneself and others. Mentalizing talents are also referred to as the capacity for understanding and attributing meaning to mental processes in oneself and others. Attributional bias refers to the inclination to attribute the reason for occurrences to oneself, others, or the situation to understand social events and interactions. Emotional processing refers to the cognitive and psychological mechanisms involved in understanding and managing emotions. Emotional intelligence is the capacity to accurately observe and interpret facial expressions that convey emotions, as well as effectively utilize and regulate one's own emotions. Social perception refers to the process by which individuals interpret and understand the behavior, intentions, and characteristics of others in social situations. Social competence refers to the capacity to recognize, assess, and effectively utilize social cues to make accurate assessments about social roles, norms, connections, and the circumstances of others. Social knowledge, also known as social schema, is the understanding of the rules, objectives, and roles that define social circumstances and facilitate social interactions. Patients with euthymic BD experience a decline in ToM function, particularly in verbal ToM. Regarding ToM abilities in individuals with BD, there is a widespread observation of impairment during the acute periods of the illness.[45,46] However, the evidence of abnormalities in remission samples has been less compelling. The study of sociocognitive impairment in euthymic states is highly significant since these deficiencies can significantly hinder social reintegration and rehabilitation.[47] Considering the significance and influence of ToM performance on various aspects of life such as quality of life, social perception, and social behavior, it is crucial to conduct additional research on the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms behind these impairments. This research is necessary to identify specific areas to focus on in the development of personalized SC training for this particular population. A study conducted by Choudhary et al. in 2021[48] indicates that individuals with BD exhibit the lowest performance, while the HC (healthy controls) demonstrate the highest performance on the majority of SC (social cognition) tasks. Siblings, conversely, occupy an intermediate position between the patients and healthy controls for performance on all social cognition subtests, with the exception of the faux pas composite index and externalising bias, where siblings exhibited inferior performance compared to the patient group. Within the several areas of SC, the faux pas index, which reflects deficiencies in ToM, could potentially be explored as a potential endophenotype for BD. However, it is essential to replicate these findings with a larger sample size, undertake normalcy assessments for task performances, and analyze biomarkers to draw definitive conclusions from these results. In the overall population of patients with BD, there is no association between SC and demographic and clinical factors. Nevertheless, SC exhibits a notable correlation with neurocognition in both patients and siblings of patients with BD. Figure 2 presents the algorithm of approach to cognitive evaluation for BD patients.Figure 2: Algorithm of approach to cognitive evaluation in BD patientsMANAGEMENT OF COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN BD Cognitive dysfunction has been linked to psychosocial dysfunction and reduced quality of life in individuals with BD. Secondary expenses associated with BD (such as unemployment and reduced workplace efficiency) present a significantly larger economic burden. There is a pressing need for procognitive treatment to enhance the functioning and quality of life in individuals with cognitive impairment in BD.[49] Below, we present the evidence from various trials that have looked at pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions [Tables 6 and 7, respectively].Table 6: Summary of pharmacological intervention study details and resultsTable 7: Summary Psychosocial and Other Biological Intervention Study Details and ResultsTo summarize the above findings at present, no intervention has shown strong, separate, and beneficial effects on cognitive function in adults with BD, as indicated by findings from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigations. It is recommended to consider methodological concerns such as enriching the study population with persons who have pretreatment cognitive impairment and include those who are in remission. The field must also determine a cognitive measure that is thorough, with a little impact from repeated practice, and is capable of detecting changes as a dependent measure. Since we do not have any agent or therapy that can improve or reverse cognitive deficits in BD, it becomes important that we focus on intervening before these deficits set in, that is, the prevention of cognitive impairment. This can be done first by identifying the mediators of the cognitive impairments and second by intervening early. The mediators of cognitive deficits of BD are educational attainment and premorbid intelligence quotient (proxy variables of cognitive reserve), clinical symptomatology (remission vs acute episode), subclinical depressive symptoms, psychotic symptoms, bipolar diagnostic subtype, psychiatric or medical comorbidity, illness duration (chronicity), number of episodes, pharmacological treatment, and childhood adversity. The potential prevention strategies would be to prevent multiple episodes with effective pharmacotherapy and the implementation of psychoeducation programs, avoid concomitant medications that interfere with cognitive function, treat subclinical depressive symptoms, control comorbidity (mental and psychiatric), promote healthy habits and aerobic physical exercise, implement cognitive or functional remediation, prescribe adjunctive procognitive treatment, and use noninvasive brain stimulation techniques (TMS, tDCS) wherever indicated, early in the course of the illness, that is, after the first episode.[69] APPLICATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE Early interventions in bd The early interventions can again be divided into two, one in the people who have developed the illness and are in the early course and second in those who are at high risk of developing BD. In BD patients in the early course of illness, the ISBD task force has given certain recommendations after a detailed systematic review. They recommend that the combination of psychological and pharmaceutical interventions may provide synergistic effects, although the most effective interventions or combinations for this specific group in the early stages are yet uncertain. They also suggest considering the potential benefits of lithium in reducing relapses in the early stages of illness, along with the data supporting the use of both medication and psychoeducation; it is important to assess the effectiveness of combining lithium and psychoeducation therapies in the early stages of illness. Based on the available evidence supporting the use of both medication and psychological treatments, individuals in the early stages of BD should be provided with the opportunity to receive safe and effective interventions.[70] Another systematic review that evaluated the efficacy of early intervention in high-risk individuals (with an affected FDR) concluded that existing studies provide limited data regarding the conversion to BD, which is the primary outcome measure in early intervention research. Conducting multicenter, prospective randomized studies with large sample numbers, confirmed familial risk, and a homogeneous group of participants would provide valuable insights into the impact of a single intervention. Several therapies with documented efficacy in treating mood episodes, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, atypical antipsychotics, and moderate physical exercise, should be considered for implementation in this particular population. It is important to carefully assess the ethical implications of providing antipsychotics to a high-risk group. Early intervention in the initial phases of a problem can help avoid the long-term impact of the disease and yield significant advantages in terms of both human wellbeing and economic considerations and will greatly contribute to the prevention onset of BD.[71] SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Many individuals with BD exhibit measurable cognitive impairment in all clinical phases, including euthymia, even after accounting for potential confounding factors such as demographic characteristics, drug effects, and residual depressed symptoms. This cognitive impairment affects all domains, although it is especially pronounced in verbal memory and executive functioning. Several studies provide evidence suggesting that lithium treatment has a slight detrimental effect on cognitive performance in a certain subset of people with BD who do not respond well to the medication. Valproate is linked to poorer cognitive function in comparison to other drugs used to stabilize mood, although the effect of second-generation antipsychotics on cognition is still uncertain. Existing research indicates that, in contrast to individuals with schizophrenia, the majority of people with BD exhibit cognitive abilities that are average or higher than normal prior to the onset of the disorder. Nevertheless, a portion of individuals with BD has below-average premorbid intellectual ability, suggesting that early neurodevelopmental issues may contribute to the development of BD in this specific group of patients. The available prospective studies do not provide evidence to support the notion of gradual cognitive loss in BD after the initial episode. In contrast, certain research indicates that patients may observe enhancements in cognitive performance through suitable treatment following the initial manic episode. Cognitive functioning plays a crucial role in predicting how well people with BD can do their everyday activities and work. Initial results from limited studies have indicated the potential cognitive-enhancing effects of behavioral interventions (cognitive remediation) as well as pharmacological interventions (erythropoietin, intranasal insulin, lurasidone, and mifepristone) and neurostimulation interventions (rTMS and tDCS). Conducting longitudinal studies on the neurocognitive functioning of individuals at high risk of BD can enhance our understanding of how neurocognitive impairment develops and progresses in BD. This knowledge can then be used to develop specific early intervention strategies that aim to prevent or slow down and potentially reverse cognitive decline. Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant influence that cognitive abilities have on the overall functioning of individuals with BD. Therefore, future efficacy trials should also prioritize investigating the possible positive and negative effects of therapies on cognitive performance and functional outcomes.

      "abstract": "The concept of a spectrum of posttraumatic disorders has been postulated by a variety of major contributors to the field of psychotraumatology. Although Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is one trauma-based mental health disorder, there are other posttraumatic illnesses that do not qualify for PTSD, nor are they accurately described by other diagnostic categories in the DSM-IV. The present paper proposes and delineates a new syndrome, entitled Posttraumatic Relationship Syndrome (PTRS), which is a function of the experience of trauma in the context of an emotionally intimate relationship. It differs from PTSD in four fundamental ways: (1) the nature of the Stressor criterion; (2) the response to the Stressor; (3) the inclusion of a category of relational symptoms; and (4) the way of coping with the trauma (i.e., it lacks the emotional numbing and avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma). The latter is the most salient difference as it involves a qualitatively different experience of the “world of trauma”-a primarily conscious experience in PTRS and an often unconscious experience in PTSD.",

      "title": "Influences of prenatal and postnatal stress on cognitive function and fear memory consolidation",
      "abstract": "Stress can be defined as the brain response to any demand. Maternal exposure to stress during pregnancy may have negative effects on fetal and infant neurodevelopment, including delayed mental and motor development, difficult temperament, and impaired cognitive performance. Some of these effects are seen on brain structure and function and in the risk for later depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Stress in adolescence appears to have lasting effects on brain regions such as the hippocampus and alters mood and anxiety-related behaviors in animal models, as well as cognitive function. The brain is the key organ of the response to stress because it determines what is threatening and, therefore, potentially stressful, as well as the physiological and behavioral responses which can be either adaptive or damaging. Stressors in adult life alter neuronal morphology in brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex and influence learning, anxiety, executive function, and somatic-visceral functions. Exposure to stress and stress hormones during the prenatal period, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood or aging, has an impact on brain structures involved in cognition and mental health. As demonstrated in the above, generally stress can have wide ranging effects on emotions, mood and behavior.",

Pain is the sensation that usually arises when noxious stimulus causes real or potential damage to bodily tissue.

Adaptive pain contributes to survival by protecting organism from injury. Contrary, maladaptive pain is an expression of the pathologic operation of nervous system. Chronic pain in humans has been arbitrarily defined as pain lasting for more than 6 months. It is not only results from prolonged sensitization of nociceptive neurons but also from influence of social and psychological factors.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: How to Alleviate Her Suffering; Accurate Diagnosis, Tailored Treatments Can Greatly Improve Women's Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Approximately 75% of women experience a premenstrual change in emotional or physical symptoms commonly referred to as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These symptoms--including increased irritability, tension, depressed mood, and somatic complaints such as breast tenderness and bloating--often are mild to moderate and cause minimal distress. (1) However, approximately 3% to 9% of women experience moderate to severe premenstrual mood symptoms that meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] PMDD includes depressed or labile mood, anxiety, irritability, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms that occur exclusively during the 2 weeks before menses and cause significant deterioration in daily functioning. Women with PMDD use general and mental health services more often than women without the condition. (3) They may experience impairment in marital and parental relationships as severe as that experienced by women with recurrent or chronic major depression. (2) PMDD often responds to treatment. Unfortunately, many women with PMDD do not seek treatment, and to 90% may go undiagnosed.4 In this article, we review the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PMDD. A complex disorder A distinguishing characteristic of PMDD is the timing of symptom onset. In women with PMDD, mood symptoms occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (ovulation until onset of menses) and resolve after menstruation onset. Women with PMDD report normal mood and functioning during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (first day of the menstrual cycle until ovulation). Although PMS and PMDD criteria share affective and somatic symptoms, more symptoms are required for a PMDD diagnosis, and symptoms often are more severe. (5) As defined in DSM-IV-TR (Table), (6) PMDD has a broader range of symptoms than PMS and includes symptoms not included in the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria for PMS, (7) such as impaired concentration, appetite, and sleep (hypersomnia or insomnia); and mood lability. PMDD symptoms must occur only during the 2 weeks preceding menses, although average symptoms last 6 days and severity usually peaks in the 2 days before menses. (1) The prevalence of subthreshold PMDD is fairly common; approximately 19% of women will meet some--but not all--DSM-IV-TR criteria for PMDD. (3) In a revision proposed for DSM-5, PMDD would be included as a mood disorder, which represents a significant change from DSM-IV-TR, where it is listed in the appendix as criteria. (8) In addition, in oral contraceptive users, a PMDD diagnosis should not be made unless the premenstrual symptoms are reported to be present and as severe when the woman is not taking the oral contraceptive.

In most menstrual cycles of the past year, [greater than or equal to] 5 of the following symptoms must be present for most of the time during the last week of the luteal phase, begin to remit within a few days after the onset of the follicular phase, and are absent in the week postmenses, with [greater than or equal to] 1 of the symptoms being either 1, 2, 3, or 4: 1.

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

To date, however, there is little literature on pseudodementia as a delayed traumatic stress response. The authors present a case history of a 50‐year‐old woman who developed severe cognitive impairment following retrieval of previously forgotten memories of childhood sexual abuse. Her cognitive condition deteriorated rapidly and dramatically. Neuropsychological assessment and clinical presentation led to a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (vs. corticobasal degeneration). Detailed neurologic and medical evaluations could not identify any underlying physical cause. Her condition progressively worsened over 9 months, at which point memantine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist, was begun. The patient regained full functioning over the next year. Although an organic cause could not be ruled out, it was likely that recovery of traumatic memories was contributory to the patient's condition, as ongoing psychotherapy had begun 1 year into the course. If additional cases with similar presentations are reported, such cases would corroborate the notion that persistent, severe, and reversible cognitive impairment constitutes a previously unrecognized and atypical posttraumatic response.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

Moreover, there is a growing evidence that patients with CFS belong to an inhomogeneous group with different etiologic constellations. Specific somatic factors, e.g. viruses, seem to be less important for onset than certain personality-traits like depressiveness and workaholism. These traits lead to an increased vulnerability to unspecific psychological or biological stressors that may cause chronic fatigue by complex psychosomatic interferences. Concerning diagnosis, there are no specific methods or results available, the same is true for pharmacological treatment. As a consequence, practitioners should be aware not to miss a somatic disease causing fatigue, and, parallel to this, start right from the beginning talking about the psychosomatic background of CFS. Furthermore, psychotherapy has shown to be effective in CFS.",

During one year we followed up every 3 months, 4 women, mean age 53.5 years admitted in Psychiatry Clinic. They all presented for depressive symptoms, started for about 4 years before, for which a series of antidepressants were used without any clinical improvement. Clinical, psychiatric and psychological evaluations were performed every 3 months, showing slowed verbal rhythm, difficulties in expressing themselves and finding right words, repetitive speech, lack of spontaneity and initiative. No perceptual disturbances or memory impairment were found. Systematically neurologic examination was normal except for bradykinesia and bradypsychia. MRI showed evidence of frontal and temporal involvement. According to DSM 5, criteria for probable neurocognitive frontotemporal disorder were fulfilled, as there were a prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production with relative sparing of learning and memory. Because of the nature of the symptoms and the fact that a patient is often 'too young' for dementia to be considered, FTD is often initially misdiagnosed. Especially when present in midlife, it can be a significant clinical challenge to distinguish it from primary psychiatric disorders like major depression, bipolar illness or even late-onset schizophrenia.

Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

Faced with recommending long-term treatment, the clinician must discern the primacy of disorder, which may have been only obliquely addressed at the time of the patient's presentation and then solved by concurrent treatment. Establishing primacy relies on determining whether the psychiatric symptoms were induced by SUD or the psychiatric disorder emerged first and substance use was a means of coping with it. A third possibility exists—that the two disorders developed independently of each other, albeit becoming intermingled over time and serving to exacerbate each other. Clues to the temporal relationship of the disorders can be deduced from a meticulous history obtained from multiple sources, the effects that acute treatment has had on either condition, and the patient's willingness to remain abstinent from the addictive substance. Hasin and colleagues demonstrated the importance that a history of depression has on long-term remission and relapse outcomes in substance dependence (Slide 1).",

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

      "title": "Specific Phobia vs Panic Disorder in Children: A Unique Case Report and Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Specific phobia is defined as marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear and anxiety, is actively avoided, or endured with intense fear or anxiety that is out proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object/situation and to the sociocultural context. These symptoms are persistent and last for at least six months. The prevalence of specific and social phobia in children and adolescents is 2.9 and 0.3%. Panic disorder is defined as recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and is accompanied by at least 4/13 symptoms. One of these panic attacks must be followed by at least one month of constant worry about additional panic attacks and their consequences. There is a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. Such disturbances are not attributable to physiological effects of other substances, medical conditions, or other mental disorders. The prevalence of panic disorders is 5 – 15 percent in adolescents and 5 percent in children.\r\n\r\nCase Presentation: We present a case of a 3-year old male with panic attacks for over one year which started after an incident of smoke detector alarm followed by three more episodes of panic attacks at the daycare center. The recent episode was 4 weeks ago. After the last incident, the patient stopped eating and refused food which worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobia, eating disorder, and referred to outpatient Psychologist.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n• Learn about anxiety disorders in children.\r\n\r\n• Management options for anxiety in children.\r\n\r\n• Etiopathogenesis of anxiety in children.\r\n\r\nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of panic disorder below the age of 4. We conducted a literature review and found no cases published. This is an interesting case for psychiatrists, therapists and pediatricians to learn as there is a lack of evidence in treating children under the age of 4. No medication recommendations were available for this age group; however, off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication was discussed with the patient’s mother who refused. We agreed with the primary care team’s recommendations and the case was referred to an out-patient psychotherapist.",

      "title": "Failure to Comply: Madness and/as Testimony",
      "abstract": "Self-harm, suicide attempts, disordered eating, addiction, and other forms of “acting out” are associated with the trauma of surviving violence. While these behaviours are pathologized as symptoms of mental illness, they can be understood, instead, as strategies of resistance against violence. When violence is ignored or normalized, the “acting out” associated with trauma can be a means of sounding an alarm that something is very wrong. This “acting out” can be understood as an embodied form of testimony. When direct resistance to violence, such as fighting back or escaping, is thwarted or impossible, traumatic “acting out” can be a way to draw attention to and resist violence. Psychiatry, instead of answering the call of trauma by addressing the underlying violence, works to silence that call. Through incarceration, sexual violence, enforced isolation, restricted motion, threats, coercive drugging, gaslighting, and other abusive tactics, psychiatry works to undermine the embodied testimony of trauma by producing compliance. The source of the problem is shifted from the original violence and located instead in the body of the traumatized person. Successful treatment is understood as the reduction or elimination of the very “symptoms” which are in reality acts of resistance to violence. Therefore, successful treatment essentially means submission. The carceral space of psychiatry continues the work of producing compliance even after the patient has left its enclosures, extending the space of the psych ward into the everyday lives of psychiatric survivors.",

Its evaluation belongs to the workday routine of social physicians. Special difficulties arise if chronic pain disorders are to be evaluated, especially in chronic \"nonspecific\" cases, i.e. in the absence of biomedically relevant signs. Employment-related performance is conceptualised as a multidimensional construct with several latent variables. It integrates and extends the domains of \"impairments\" and \"disabilities\" of the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) of WHO. Three basic dimensions are distinguished: one comprising biomedical, the other psychological, the third function-related variables. They are specified within a multidimensional model of employment-related performance. This includes different components of the perception and appraisal of pain, concomitant bodily complaints (e.g. vital exhaustion), psychological impairments as helplessness or anxiety, special facets of the pain behaviour, and functional limitations and allows an estimate of the chronification and prognosis of the pain problem. Some diagnostic measures are still inadequate in respect of established clinimetric standards. In particular, assessment of functional limitations requires further development and research.",

However, acute pain loses its adaptive function when it transitions into chronic pain. Various psychosocial factors influence pain perception and the transition from acute to chronic pain, with psychological flexibility (including its subcomponents emotional and cognitive flexibility) and mindfulness being among those factors. However, the role of psychological flexibility in the development of chronic pain (i.e., non-recovery) remains largely unknown. This dissertation aimed to gain insight into the link between psychological flexibility and mindfulness, and pain experience and recovery. Findings did not uniformly point to a relationship between the relatively new concepts of psychological flexibility (i.e., emotional and cognitive flexibility) and mindfulness, and pain experience and recovery. However, first indications of associations between emotional flexibility and recovery from pain and of beneficial effects of mindfulness for wound healing have been put forward.",

Stress can occur due to a physical injury, mechanical disturbance, chemical change, or emotional factor. Stress can occur at all ages, including children and adolescents. Various physical and psychological events can cause stress in children, for example suffering from an illness, injury/trauma, parental divorce, parental death, sexual abuse, natural disasters, war, etc. Various exposures to physical and psychological stress harmful to the body can cause it to carry out defense mechanisms against these threats, one of which is changes in the cortisol hormone. Cortisol hormone is used as a biochemical marker for acute and chronic stress. The increase in this hormone as an indicator of stress can be changed through psychosocial interventions, one of which is by the provision of music therapy. Music therapy can manage stress problems of people at various ages with minimal side effects and a small amount of money. It is also easy to apply and does not require any intellectual ability to interpret. There are no limitations for users to use music therapy.",

The feeling of an acceleration or a slowing down of the passage of time (PoT) is common. However, there are very few experiments on this temporal feeling. In addition, the few data on the subject are contradictory because of the variety of meanings that this judgement can encompass. The aim of this chapter is to define the different forms of judgement of the PoT according to the period considered and the underlying psychological mechanisms. Four types of PoT judgement are then distinguished: the retrospective PoT judgements for the long periods of life (5–10 years, as we get older) and those for the shorter periods (last week, last month), and the PoT judgements for the present, made either retrospectively (present PoT judgement) or prospectively (PoT judgement of durations).",

      "abstract": "The American Psychiatric Association defines mental illnesses as alterations in the cognitive, emotional or behavioral sphere (or a combination of these domains), which lead to suffering and/or problems in the person's social, professional or relational interaction skills. Given the range of possible symptoms, when talking about mental illnesses, reference should always be made to a standardized classification system, i.e. a list of disorders recognized to date, accompanied by their description and lists of symptoms and essential criteria for diagnosis. Currently, the most widely used manual in the world is the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), published by the American Psychiatric Association, whose structure follows a multiaxial system. Other international norms or classification systems include the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), which is often referred to by the WHO in mental health action plans, defining \"mental disorders\" as the range of disorders that falls under the ICD-10 classification. Within the given classifications, we can find disorders of different severities, with significant differences both in terms of the degree of suffering and in terms of the effects on the person's capacity for social interaction. However, the present paper does not aim to analyze clinical problems related to mental illnesses, but to address the state of care of people suffering from such illnesses in our country. In particular, we are motivated by the need to examine, from a bioethical point of view, critical issues arising from various studies of the current state of psychiatric care, critical issues affecting the lives of people with mental illness and their families, and which are strongly denounced to the institutions by the scientific societies.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe term anxiety is conceptually used in order to define the alertness of an individual in face of the imminence of a certain danger, being, therefore, an emotional state of great adaptive and evolutionary value, essential for survival.However, when the individual presents a persistent anxious state, in addition to periods appropriate to the level of development, this may show anxiety no longer as an adaptive circumstance, but as a psychiatric disorder.Although there is no clear cause for the onset of this disorder, the etiology of anxiety includes the association of a genetic predisposition and psychosocial factors such as stress.Brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus are essential in the response to stress due to their neuromodulation on the HPA axis, which is the control center for the response to stress.Changes in the HPA axis have been associated with the onset of anxiety.In view of this, animal models that study the stress circuit have been explored in order to correlate rodent behavior to human neural processes.In this research, the model used was chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), which promotes moderate to intense stressful stimuli.Environmental enrichment (EE), in the other hand, is a paradigm that provides the animal with varied stimuli and is capable of reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.In this project, the EE was employed with the purpose of evaluating the effects that this environment produces in the face of exposure to CUS on the anxious behavior.Aim Investigate the role of the HPA axis in the modulation of anxious behavior after CUS in animals exposed to EE. MethodologyThe mice were submitted to EE and, subsequently, exposed to the CUS protocol.The role of the HPA axis was investigated by pharmacological inhibition by Metyrapone (MET), which was administered via i.p 30 minutes before each stress.Anxious behavior was then assessed using the elevated plus maze (EPM).Plasma concentrations of corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) were assessed.Results EE, when associated with CUS, favored an anxious phenotype, prevented when there was an overlap of the three variables, which promoted an anxiolytic effect.This anxiolytic effect of EE-CUS-MET was accompanied by an increase in CORT.Apparently, MET acted as a protective agent against anxiety triggered by stress in animals previously enriched, canceling out the disturbing agent (stress).EE animals submitted to CUS showed an increase in plasma ACTH, inhibited by MET.Changes in the HPA axis induced by chronic administration of MET revealed an increase in plasma CORT inversely proportional to anxious behavior, so that higher concentrations of circulating CORT reversed the anxiogenic state.As for the expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GR), EE reduced the expression of hippocampal GR and increased in CPF.Conclusion EE did not have a protective effect against CUS, but intensified the stress threshold, resulting in anxious behavior.However, chronic administration of MET promoted changes in the HPA axis and inhibited anxious behavior induced by EE + CUS, at the expense of an increase in plasma corticosterone concentrations.",

If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms. Treatment approach depends on whether negative symptoms are primary or secondary. Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

There is no such thing as a non‐physical illness. Asking whether emotions cause diseases, or diseases cause emotions, leads to many difficulties and is unprofitable. It is far more useful to ask about stimulus‐response relationships. There are more kinds of specificity relations in psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine than are usually recognized, and the usual specificity statements in psychosomatic medicine are not concerned with I‐R or S‐R specificity. There are many problems in medicine which psychophysiology could help to solve.",

      "title": "“Hidden” and Diverse Long-Term Impacts of Exposure to War and Violence",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, the PTSD diagnosis is often a prerequisite for the survivor's access to specialized treatment services and for obtaining legal recognition or financial compensation when exposed to violence. However, some survivors do not meet all necessary criteria for the PTSD diagnosis, particularly not in the long term. Therefore, they run the risk of being misdiagnosed, inadequately helped or undertreated, and may remain legally unrecognized and unprotected. In this article the \"hidden\" long-term impacts of exposure to war and violence, beyond the PTSD diagnosis, are presented, discussed, and illustrated with case presentations. They include dissociative states, attachment problems, personality changes, guilt, shame, rage, identity issues, moral injury, substances abuse, damaged core beliefs, and bodily sensations linked to stress activation. These phenomena are not persistent, but fluctuate over the survivor's life trajectories. Moreover, the \"hidden\" impacts are framed within theoretical models for understanding long-term impacts of exposure to violence. The models help us grasp the dynamics of interactions between resilience, psychological damage, context and time. These interactions are non linear, and contingently result in development of psychopathological phenomena when reaching a threshold during a process of accumulating potentially traumatic experiences over a survivors' lifetime. Understanding psychological impacts of exposure to violence as a spectrum of interchangeable phenomena over a lifetime, and learning to recognize the \"hidden\" manifestations of psychological trauma will help to improve mental and legal assistance to the survivors both on a short and long term.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic disorder that requires long-term management. Although effective treatments are available, MDD frequently remains undiagnosed. Furthermore, once recognized, treatment duration and dosage are often inadequate and adherence to medication is often poor. However, adequate acute phase treatment of MDD is essential to reduce symptomatology, and improve quality of life and the clinical course. After remission, treatment should be continued for 4–9 months to consolidate the remission and prevent relapse. For patients who do not respond adequately to their initial antidepressant therapy, switching or augmentation of therapy may be necessary. Many patients suffer residual symptomatology, even when classified as being in remission. In addition to the suffering and impairment that this causes, residual symptomatology is associated with a high rate of relapse. Clinicians should strive to achieve asymptomatic recovery both in terms of core symptomatology and psychosocial disability. This requires appropriate treatment at therapeutic doses for a sufficient duration; education and support to promote patient compliance with treatment; and regular monitoring and prompt intervention for patients with symptoms that persist even at subsyndromal levels. In conclusion, there remains considerable scope for improving the identification, treatment and management of patients with MDD.",

      "abstract": "Aims Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as a noncyclical pain that has duration of at least 6 months and can lead to decreased quality of life and physical performance. The pain can be attributed to problems in the pelvic organs and/or problems in related systems, and possible psycho‐social attributes may contribute to the manifestation. Due to the complex nature, CPP syndromes are multifactorial and the terminology needs to reflect the setting. Methods The current review is a synthesis of key aspects of the recent International Continence Society Standardization for Terminology in CPP Syndromes. Results Nine domains can be used for a detailed description of CPP. They include four domains specific to the pelvic organs (lower urinary tract, female genital, male genital, gastrointestinal), two related to other sources of pain which may be perceived in the pelvis (musculoskeletal, neurological) and three which may influence the response to the pain or its impact on the individual (psychological, sexual, and comorbidities). For an individual patient with CPP, each domain should be reviewed in terms of symptoms and signs, noting that positive findings could reflect either a primary cause or a secondary consequence. The findings will guide further evaluations and subsequent treatment. Conclusion We present a synthesis of the standard for terminology in CPP syndromes in women and men, which serves as a systematic framework to consider possible sources of pain (pelvic organs or other sources) and the individual responses and impact.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic reactions in the context of meditation and esoteric practices have been described in the psychiatric literature. In most cases, these psychotic conditions are transient and do not lead to functional impairment. The authors present the case of a 46-year-old woman who had worked as a spiritual healer for several years and, in the course of this occupation, increasingly developed a highly specific configuration of psychotic symptoms (all of which could be convincingly traced back to the formerly used spiritual techniques) along with depressive symptoms and severe functional impairment. The differential diagnosis was initially complicated by the relative conformity of the patient’s psychotic symptoms with her occupational practices and the absence of other, more typical, symptoms of schizophrenia. Only a thorough anamnesis with another spiritual healer and precise identification of psychopathology helped to disentangle the merely uncommon from the pathologic features of this case. Possible mechanisms of psychotogenesis are discussed in light of the literature and the specific features of the presented case. Although a single case report cannot prove a causal link between spiritual healing and development of psychosis, the patient’s specific psychopathology, with preeminently disturbed self-experience, and its consistency with the patient’s spiritual practices suggest at least a contributory role in this case.",

They are not always the object of an acute request for medical care, and when such a request is made, it is rarely based on what the child feels, but much more on noisy or troublesome behaviour or somatic manifestations of the latter, this last possibility producing a masked psychiatric emergency very characteristic of this age; 2) environmental emergencies represent a second form of emergency, defined by a situation which appears when the child's family or tutors suddenly decide that they can no longer face such a behaviour or such symptoms in the child. Intolerance then appears, or even rejection of the child from his home. The authors were led to determine this double dimension, concentrating their attention on the first few years of life, childhood from 4 to 5 years to 11 or 12 years and adolescence. Insisting on the dual necessity, even in emergency cases, of sufficient reflexion and necessary concentration of interest on problems as they are presented by the family, the authors describe the various stages of an emergency: entering into contact, evaluation of the situation, choice of the emergency procedure: gaining time or admission to hospital in a specialized unit. They end by taking into consideration the fact that one is never sufficiently attentive to the child himself and to his own way of dealing with the situation.",

The most commonly reported symptom is headache, although cognitive impairment, amnesia, disequilibrium, sleep disturbances, and behavioral changes are frequently reported as well. By definition, these neurologic symptoms and signs should recover with time; however, there is growing concern for irreversible cumulative effects of repeat concussions. This raises the clinical question that we will address in this chapter—how many concussions are too many before an athlete should retire? Three clinical presentations that should prompt the treating clinician to recommend retirement from contact sports include the following: (1) diagnosis of a neurodegenerative condition, (2) permanent or persistent cognitive or neurobehavioral impairment, and (3) intractable pain and headache (Table 22-1). A relative indication to consider retirement would be progressively lower threshold for concussion with worse symptoms. We will address the evidence that supports these conclusions. Table 22-1 Four Clinical Presentations That Should Prompt Recommendations for Retirement From Contact Sports Strongly recommend retirement if there is: Diagnosis of a neurodegenerative condition Permanent or persistent cognitive or neurobehavioral impairment Intractable pain and headache Consider recommending retirement if there is: Progressively lower threshold for concussion or progressively more severe symptoms",

PTSD is a long-life effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions, leading to the production of feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and horror in the person. There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD, such as physical, mental, or sexual assault at home or working place by others, unexpected death of a loved one, an accidental event, war, or some kind of natural disaster. Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person. Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing trauma, abusive or bad relationships. Various drugs which are used for the treatment of PTSD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, etc.); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and isocarboxazid); mood stabilizers (Divalproex and lamotrigine); atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and quetiapine), etc. In this review, we have covered the different risk factors, case studies related to various treatment options with different age group of peoples with PTSD and their effects on them. We have also covered the symptoms and associated disorders which can play a key role in the development of PTSD.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the prevalence of trauma exposure and posttraumatic problems in the elderly and reviews information on resilience and suggested treatment approaches. While posttraumatic stress disorder in the elderly has been studied, less is known about other common trauma- and stressor-related disorders including adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, and traumatic grief. The <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (fifth edition) defines trauma as “exposure or actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence.” It must be directly experienced, witnessed, or occur to a family member or friend, or it could be a repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of a traumatic event. No event is always traumatic, and, conversely, even a seemingly mild negative event can be traumatic to some individuals. Two presumed variables are (a) appraisal of the situation (whether a person feels in control) and (b) individual biological differences in responsiveness.",

      "title": "Mental Stress; Brain’s Complexity Resolution Dilemma",
      "abstract": "Mental stress in humans, on the face of it, is the perception of unease, of various degrees, in response to stressors, such as, threats, emotional, economic, socioeconomic and political instabilities, and other conditionssome due to geopolitical conditions and some emblematic of modern timeswhich create intense and/or difficult brain engagements. However, since such perception, besides serving as the alarm phase, could also be indicative of other, and often adverse, physiological effects, it has been the subject of much research since the early decades of last century [1-5]. These efforts, which have resulted in a vast body of the very valuable scientific findings, revolve around the physiological processes that stressors prompt in the biologic system; and how they affect its equilibrium, i.e., its homeostasis. But how the physiological processes are triggered through involvement of sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, as well as other systemsthe underlying cause of what can be considered the over-drive engagements of these systemshas seemingly escaped scientific scrutiny and remains unanswered; perhaps because it does not have much bearing on the medical treatments of the ensuing effects of sustained (chronic) stress sensation, and also mainly because much about the details of brain processing of sensory data has not been clearly figured out, though the role of the brain in perception of the world, and life as a whole, has been widely recognized since the enlightenment era; early 17th century. However progress, in last few decades, in understanding modus operandi of the brain, has led to further recognition of the fact that much of the brain operations are computational in nature: It is inferred that brain, and the rest of the nervous system, comprise extensive computational machinery that process all sense-relayed information; using its innate (evolutionary-formulated) instructions, imbedded in its constructs (as patterns), for analyzing events and creating perceptions. In the context of such idealization of the operation of the brain [6], this work is an attempt to throw some light on the puzzle of stress; suggesting a mechanism for creation of its sensation, and the prompting of the physiologic effects.",

      "title": "Psychological Trauma",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder is the quintessential mind/body disorder that alters physiological, biological, and psychological homeostasis. People who have been traumatized often present with distressing and frequently intractable psychosomatic symptoms, often without knowing consciously that the source of their symptoms is the trauma they experienced. The stress response may be considered to exist along a continuum: eustress, stress, and traumatic stress. Traumatic stress precipitates a condition of physiological and psychobiological imbalance in the nervous system and in the endocrine, immune, and neuropeptide systems. Some evidence suggests that discrimination may constitute a stressor and contribute to a greater lifetime allostatic load. Conversely, social relationships mitigate the effects of allostatic load. This intersects with a new model of stress response called \"tend and befriend.\" Learned helplessness intersects with the central assertion of state-dependent memory, learning, and behavior: what we learn and remember is dependent on our psychophysiological state at the time of the experience.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of essential fatty acid, B vitamin, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation for managing stress in women: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this systematic review is to identify the effectiveness of essential fatty acids (EFAs), B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc, consumed as supplements to the daily diet, for managing stress in women. Background The definition of stress has changed in the last few decades. It is no longer seen as only a natural physiological response to a life-threatening event, but also as a specific psychological experience.1 Used colloquially, it is understood to be a negative state of mind, and can broadly be defined as the fear of not being able to cope with a situation that one faces.2 “Time pressure” is another aspect related to the perception of stress today, and relates to the feeling that there is not enough time to accomplish tasks.3 Continuously feeling unable to cope, coupled with ongoing time constraints in performing required tasks, may lead to chronic stress. Chronic stress has been linked to two specific mental health disorders, namely, severe anxiety and depression, due to stress hormone release impacting a number of brain regions, including those responsible for maintaining emotional equilibrium.2,4 Therefore, although stress is not a mental health disorder, in and of itself, when experienced chronically, it may lead to anxiety disorders and depression, which are classified as mental health disorders.2,5 Although the rate at which men and women suffer from mental health disorders is similar, there are marked gender differences in the overall pattern of their mental illness.6,7 Compared to men, women are 50% more susceptible to depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobias and insomnia, hypothesized to be as a result of internalizing their feelings and emotions.2,7,8 Men are more susceptible to externalizing their feelings and emotions, which result in alcoholism, aggression, and substance abuse.2,7,8 Although there are a number of theories explaining why this gender disparity exists, such as neurobiological and neurochemical gender differences, sex steroids and psychosocial stressors, there is as yet no consensus.8,9 Even though the reproductive cycle is considered to be an important part of the physiological explanation for this gender disparity, psychosocial factors are seen to play an increasingly important role.9,10 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to poverty, socioeconomic disadvantages, subordinate social rank and gender based violence and discrimination are other societal factors to take into account when assessing the disparity between the rates of depression experienced by women and men.6 The variety of social roles that women play in today's complex society, such as being wives, mothers, workers and, caretakers of elderly parents, and the growing strata of single-mothers, may be additional risk factors that increase feelings of psychological distress, such as anxiety, fear, confusion and depression, as well as mood-swings.2,8 In addition, some research suggests that women spend more time performing household tasks, and perform a wider range of them than men do, placing additional demands on their time.11,12 The juggling of these various roles, coupled with ongoing domestic tasks, expose women to multiple stressors which can lead to the experience of chronic stress. Chronic stress has been linked to the development of depression, with a significant increase in rates of depression being observed when anxiety disorders are present too.2,7 When stress is experienced, cortisol is one of a number of hormones produced, with high levels of circulating cortisol associated with high levels of stress.2,13 The discovery that depression is also linked to high circulating levels of cortisol supports the findings of psychological research on stress and depression often co-existing.2,7 Depression has been equated to an extreme reaction to chronic stress, indicating that chronic stress could be a catalyst for the development of depression.2 However, more research has been conducted on gender differences in depression than on anxiety disorders.2 The role that gender plays in the development of depression in the presence of anxiety is therefore not well understood. The 1996 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study predicted that clinical or unipolar depression would be the second most significant cause of disability burden in the world by 2020.14 The 2004 updated GBD Study indicates that depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women in low, middle and high-income countries.15 In contrast, it ranked fourth among the 15 leading causes in 1990, showing an adverse, steady increase.14 Addressing ongoing stress may serve to prevent the development of depression in vulnerable women. High blood pressure (hypertension) may also be an indicator of increased stress levels.3 When associated with stress, blood pressure increases due to raised heart muscle activity, the narrowing of blood vessels (vasoconstriction), and increased blood flow to the heart and muscles, in anticipation of imminent physical danger. During the stress response, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is activated, which stimulates adrenal activity, consequently increasing blood pressure too.13 Although there are other physiological symptoms of stress, such as reduced immunity, gastrointestinal challenges, changes in weight and increased fatigue, measuring blood pressure may be a simple, quick and efficient way to confirm the presence of stress.3,13 As mentioned above, circulating cortisol levels, measured in either blood or saliva, also provide a good indication of stress levels.2,3,13 The body and brain are reliant on optimal nutrient supply for structure and function.16,17 Various key nutrients are critical for cognitive functioning, hormone and neurotransmitter synthesis, and stress response regulation. Stress inducing thoughts or experiences stimulate a biochemical cascade that activates the flight-or-flight response, via the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal (HPA) axis.1,2,18 Many of the B vitamins, as well as vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are used to regulate the stress response and synthesize hormones necessary for increased physical activity, such as adrenaline and cortisol.1 In contrast, the synthesis of the calming neurotransmitter serotonin also requires many of the same nutrients.17 As the stress response is a survival mechanism, it takes precedence over the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate mood, induce calm and precede sleep. Therefore, being exposed to chronic stress has the potential to deplete the body and brain of these nutrients, and reduce the capacity to synthesize other important hormones and neurotransmitters.1 Likewise, the ability to return to homeostasis after experiencing stress may be severely compromised when a deficiency in these nutrients exists.1 A downward spiral of increased stress levels and depression may result, with women being more susceptible to this trend because of their exposure to multiple stressors. Although essential fatty acids (EFAs) are not directly involved in the stress regulation process, they are critically important nutrients required for optimal cellular functioning.19 The presence of EFAs in cell membranes improves oxygen and nutrient assimilation to facilitate cellular energy production, and improves membrane flexibility and permeability, which are important aspects of cellular, and specifically, neuronal functioning.19 There are two classes of EFAs, omega 3 and omega 6, which have to be supplied by the diet because humans lack the enzymes to synthesize them.19 The brain, comprising 60% fat at dry weight, is particularly susceptible to a lack of EFAs due to the variety of critical roles they play in neuronal and synaptic membrane structure and function. It is estimated that approximately 20% of the 60% is made up of EFAs.19 Essential fatty acids are also precursors to eicosanoids, which play important roles in a variety of neural activities.19 Over the last five or six decades the consumption of omega 3 has been declining in the general population due to a variety of reasons, leading to a general deficiency in this critically important nutrient.20,21 Supplementing with the following key nutrients, which are vital for the synthesis of hormones linked to the stress response and its regulation, may be useful when ongoing stress is present: Essential fatty acids are involved in both neuronal membrane structure and neurotransmitter release.19 A deficiency in these important nutrients is linked to cognitive functioning deficits, which may affect the ability to cope with stress effectively.19,22 Specific B vitamins are used as co-factors during the stress response to synthesize adrenaline, and they are also used to synthesize neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine.1,16 B vitamins are also used during glucose metabolism in the brain.15 The role they play in cognitive functioning is therefore critical, and a deficiency may affect the ability to cope with stress effectively.17 Vitamin C has an important antioxidant role to play in the brain, in addition to being a co-factor in adrenalin and neurotransmitter synthesis. The brain and adrenal glands are the organs with the highest concentration of this critically important nutrient.16,23 A lack of this vitamin will therefore affect cognitive functioning, and may impact on the ability to cope effectively with stress.17 The micronutrient magnesium is involved in neuronal cell metabolism and is an important co-factor in adrenalin and neurotransmitter synthesis.1,24 Magnesium deficiency will therefore influence cognitive functioning, and may impact on the ability to cope with stress effectively.25 The micronutrient zinc is involved in neuronal cell structure and metabolism, and plays an important role as a co-factor in adrenalin and neurotransmitter synthesis.26,27 Zinc deficiency will therefore influence cognitive functioning, and may impact on the ability to cope effectively with stress.26 In addition, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are co-factors in converting plant based omega 3 EFAs to the highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) metabolites.19 A lack of these metabolites in brain tissue is associated with a variety of mental health challenges.19 A lack of these EFAs may therefore impact on the ability to cope with stress effectively.19 Research has clearly shown that these nutrients are required for hormone and neurotransmitter synthesis.1,17,19,24,26 During ongoing stress these nutrients become depleted because they are used on an ongoing basis to synthesize stress hormones, which takes precedence over other important physiological functions also requiring these nutrients.1,17,28 Furthermore, the absorption of some of these nutrients is also hampered during ongoing stress, and increased excretion of others occurs.1 A number of studies have examined the role that some of these nutrients play in mental health, generally, either in various combinations or alone.28–34 There is however a lack of evidence to support the use of nutrient supplementation for the management of stress, even though supplementation to ameliorate the symptoms of stress is widespread.35 The aim of this systematic review is therefore to investigate whether EFAs, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are capable of reducing levels of stress experienced by women. The review author has conducted a preliminary search of the JBI COnNECT+ database, Embase, Prospero, CINAHL and MEDLINE via PubMed databases, using the keywords below, and no prior or progressing systematic reviews addressing the effectiveness of EFAs, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc on stress levels in women have been found. Inclusion criteria Types of participants The systematic review will consider studies that include all women over the age of 18 years. Studies that include pregnant women will also be considered. Studies that have included both genders will be considered where it is possible to extract data for female participants. Women taking prescription medication for anxiety or depression will be excluded, as will hospitalized women or women suffering from eating disorders. Types of intervention(s) This review will consider studies that evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation with EFAs, specifically Omega-3; B Vitamins, specifically vitamin B3, B5, B6, B9 (folic acid) and B12; Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc at any dose/frequency for managing stress or anxiety being experienced by women. Supplements delivered in any oral form, including capsules, tablets, caplets, chewables, powders and liquids, at any dosage and for a duration of 14 days or longer will be considered. The supplementation of these nutrients will be investigated, whether used individually or in any combination. This review will not consider interventions that have used a combination of herbal and EFA, B vitamin, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation, either alone with the herbal supplement, or in combination with the herbal supplement. Types of comparators Essential fatty acid, B vitamin, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation, either alone, or combined, will be compared with either no intervention or placebo. This review will include studies that compare the named nutrients to each other, either in individual combinations or in a variety of combinations. Types of outcomes The systematic review will consider studies that include the following outcomes: Stress, as measured by any validated tool or measure, for example the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) or the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). Self- or observer reports will be considered. Anxiety, as measured by any validated tool or measure, for example, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) or the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Self- or observer reports will be considered. Measurements using validated tools, or physiological measures of stress, such as increased blood pressure or cortisol levels in blood or saliva will be considered. The presence of stress related symptoms, including, but not limited to, insomnia, irritability, headaches, fatigue, tense muscles, frequent upper respiratory tract and other infections, weight gain, weight loss, gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and loss of sexual desire will be considered. Self- or observer reports will be considered. Types of studies This review will consider experimental studies, including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies. The review will also consider observational studies, series and case control studies and descriptive cross sectional studies. Any of the studies that investigate the use of any of the named supplements, either alone or in any combination, will be included. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE via PubMed and Embase will be undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified studies and articles will be searched for additional studies. Studies published in English will be considered for inclusion in this review. No date limits are stipulated in this review. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE (via PubMed) Embase Scopus CINAHL PsycINFO In addition, the search for unpublished studies will include the following databases: MedNar PsycARTICLES National Institute of Mental Health International Association for Women's Mental Health. Initial keywords women, woman, female, gender, anxiety, psychological stress, psychological distress, psychological resilience, emotional stress, mental health, mental fatigue, essential fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium, zinc, dietary supplements, micronutrient. Assessment of methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data extraction Data will be extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI (Appendix II). The data extracted will include specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative data will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using JBI-MAStARI. All results will be subject to double data entry. Effect sizes expressed as odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed statistically using the standard Chi-square and also explored using subgroup analyses based on the different study designs included in this review, if considered useful and appropriate. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form, including tables and figures, to aid in data presentation. Subgroup analyses on the basis of participant age will be conducted if this information is available.

The review author has conducted a preliminary search of the JBI COnNECT+ database, Embase, Prospero, CINAHL and MEDLINE via PubMed databases, using the keywords below, and no prior or progressing systematic reviews addressing the effectiveness of EFAs, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc on stress levels in women have been found. Inclusion criteria Types of participants The systematic review will consider studies that include all women over the age of 18 years. Studies that include pregnant women will also be considered. Studies that have included both genders will be considered where it is possible to extract data for female participants. Women taking prescription medication for anxiety or depression will be excluded, as will hospitalized women or women suffering from eating disorders. Types of intervention(s) This review will consider studies that evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation with EFAs, specifically Omega-3; B Vitamins, specifically vitamin B3, B5, B6, B9 (folic acid) and B12; Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc at any dose/frequency for managing stress or anxiety being experienced by women. Supplements delivered in any oral form, including capsules, tablets, caplets, chewables, powders and liquids, at any dosage and for a duration of 14 days or longer will be considered. The supplementation of these nutrients will be investigated, whether used individually or in any combination. This review will not consider interventions that have used a combination of herbal and EFA, B vitamin, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation, either alone with the herbal supplement, or in combination with the herbal supplement. Types of comparators Essential fatty acid, B vitamin, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation, either alone, or combined, will be compared with either no intervention or placebo. This review will include studies that compare the named nutrients to each other, either in individual combinations or in a variety of combinations. Types of outcomes The systematic review will consider studies that include the following outcomes: Stress, as measured by any validated tool or measure, for example the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) or the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). Self- or observer reports will be considered. Anxiety, as measured by any validated tool or measure, for example, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) or the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Self- or observer reports will be considered. Measurements using validated tools, or physiological measures of stress, such as increased blood pressure or cortisol levels in blood or saliva will be considered. The presence of stress related symptoms, including, but not limited to, insomnia, irritability, headaches, fatigue, tense muscles, frequent upper respiratory tract and other infections, weight gain, weight loss, gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and loss of sexual desire will be considered. Self- or observer reports will be considered. Types of studies This review will consider experimental studies, including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies. The review will also consider observational studies, series and case control studies and descriptive cross sectional studies. Any of the studies that investigate the use of any of the named supplements, either alone or in any combination, will be included. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE via PubMed and Embase will be undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified studies and articles will be searched for additional studies. Studies published in English will be considered for inclusion in this review. No date limits are stipulated in this review. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE (via PubMed) Embase Scopus CINAHL PsycINFO In addition, the search for unpublished studies will include the following databases: MedNar PsycARTICLES National Institute of Mental Health International Association for Women's Mental Health. Initial keywords women, woman, female, gender, anxiety, psychological stress, psychological distress, psychological resilience, emotional stress, mental health, mental fatigue, essential fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium, zinc, dietary supplements, micronutrient. Assessment of methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data extraction Data will be extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI (Appendix II). The data extracted will include specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative data will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using JBI-MAStARI. All results will be subject to double data entry. Effect sizes expressed as odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed statistically using the standard Chi-square and also explored using subgroup analyses based on the different study designs included in this review, if considered useful and appropriate. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form, including tables and figures, to aid in data presentation. Subgroup analyses on the basis of participant age will be conducted if this information is available.

      "title": "Psychological factors in the irritable bowel syndrome.",
      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent psychological studies of patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or 'functional abdominal pain'. Many studies have used unreliable or invalid methods of assessment and some have confused personality with treatable psychiatric illness. Reliable and valid measures have indicated that 40-50% of patients with recently diagnosed functional abdominal pain have demonstrable psychiatric illness; these patients have a worse prognosis than those who are psychologically normal. When psychiatric disorder is diagnosed in a patient with IBS there are three possibilities: (1) The patient may have developed abdominal and psychiatric symptoms simultaneously in which case treatment of the latter may relieve the bowel symptoms. (2) Psychiatric disorder may precipitate increased concern about bowel symptoms, and consequent attendance at the gastroenterology clinic, of those with chronic mild symptoms. In this case it is illness behaviour, rather than abdominal symptoms, that is caused by the anxiety/depression. (3) Those with chronic neurotic symptoms as part of their personality must be screened for organic disease if they have a fresh onset of bowel symptoms; but they are at high risk of becoming persistent clinic attenders. Further research is needed to clarify when psychological abnormalities play a role in the aetiology of IBS and when they are coincidental, but lead to illness behaviour. The role of psychological factors in the aetiology of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is far from clear, but a review of the literature suggests that some consistent patterns are emerging in spite of methodological problems. There have been three major defects with studies that have linked IBS with neurotic symptomatology. First, the measurement of psychological factors has generally been imprecise. Second, most studies have considered IBS patients as a single group, without making allowance for differing symptom patterns. Third, conclusions have been drawn about hospital samples and extrapolated to all IBS subjects, without taking account of factors which affect consulting behaviour. Most studies have been concerned with psychological factors so these will be considered in most detail.",

Cuando se perpetua la agresion aparecen en la mujer distorsiones cognitivas, disminucion de la autoestima y, otra vez, sentimientos de culpabilidad e indefension. Finalmente, la mujer maltratada queda sometida a una situacion de asilamiento social y de dependencia del agresor que volvera a afectar a su autoestima, le privara de un soporte social adecuado e incrementara la sensacion de poder y control del agresor. Todos estos fenomenos pueden comportarse, atendiendo a las distintas teorias, aislada o conjuntamente como fuentes etiopatogenicas de depresion, aumentando la probabilidad de que aparezca este trastorno en las mujeres victimas de malos tratos por parte de la pareja. EnglishThe Battered Woman Syndrome presents a series of characteristics that act as etiopathogenic elements of depression. It is, firstly, an important psychosocial and physical stress factor that may act as a catalyst for depressive disorders. Secondly, this type of violence mainly occurs in the domestic environment, which provokes feelings of loss, guilt, and helplessness in the victim. When violence is perpetuated, the woman presents cognitive distortions, low self-esteem and, at other times, feelings of guilt and helplessness. Lastly, the battered woman finds herself in a situation of social isolation and dependence on her attacker, which will again affect her self-esteem, deprive her of adequate social support, and increase her feeling of the attacker’s power and control. In accordance with the different theories, all of these phenomena may act, separately or together, as etiopathogenic sources of depression, increasing the probability of this disorder appearing in women who are victims of domestic violence.",

      "title": "Neurodevelopmental and psychosocial aspects of Turner syndrome",
      "abstract": "Turner syndrome (TS) is the complex phenotype of human females with complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome, or monosomy X. A characteristic neurocognitive and psychosocial profile has also been described in TS females. Typically, specific deficits in visual-spatial/perceptual abilities, nonverbal memory function, motor function, executive function, and attentional abilities occur in TS children and adults of varying races and socioeconomic status. TS-associated psychosocial difficulties occur in the areas of maturity and social skills. We hypothesize that a subset of the neurocognitive deficits (visual-spatial/perceptual abilities) are genetically determined and result from abnormal expression of one or more X chromosome genes. In addition, a different subset of these neurocognitive deficits (memory, reaction time, and speeded motor function) result from estrogen deficiency and are at least somewhat reversible with estrogen treatment. The TS-associated psychosocial problems are most likely linked to these core neurocognitive deficits and do not reflect a separate and independent component of the syndrome. Turner syndrome research has progressed significantly over the last decade. The field has moved from descriptive reports based on single individuals or small clinical samples to the use of experimental designs with larger, more diverse and representative samples. This degree of variability among individuals with Turner syndrome in all domains (karyotype or genetic constitution, physical attributes, neurocognitive and social functioning) suggests the need to identify risk and protective factors contributing to the heterogeneity in the phenotype. Active education about TS and participation in patient advocacy groups such as the Turner Syndrome Society of the United States (http://www. turner-syndrome-us.org/) has provided new information for TS adults and families as well as a supportive peer group.

      "title": "Risk of severe postpartum episodes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Body The risk of mothers to develop a severe mental illness is dramatically increased in the first three months after giving birth. Childbirth has the strongest relationship with postpartum affective psychosis, a condition that is characterized by an acute onset of florid symptoms, usually within 2 weeks of delivery, and atypical features, such as rapidly fluctuating psychotic symptoms, florid motor symptoms, perplexity and high risks to the mother and her baby. Follow up data of women with a first episode suggest that some women only become ill in the context of childbirth whereas in others it is an expression of a lifelong bipolar disorder. Whether this reflects two distinct forms of the disorder or different degrees of vulnerability requires future study. The profound hormonal and metabolic as well as psychosocial changes in the perinatal period give rise to a number of hypotheses that seek to explain the pathogenesis of postpartum psychosis. Current research findings on biological and psychosocial risk factors will be discussed as well as what is currently known about responses to treatment. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Within little more than a decade, the subject which was thought to be associated with relatively few conditions, such as mongolism, cretinism, microcephaly and the like, has been shown by medical, genetical and psychiatric research to be significantly related to about 70 conditions. It is possible to arrange a list of these conditions, not necessarily complete, under three basic headings for the purpose of description: subcultural defects, instability defects and somatic defects. Subcultural defectives are characterized by intellectual inadequacy paralleled by a lower level of social development; unstable defectives are characterized by abnormal rather than subnormal conduct and may be of the psychopathic, the epileptic or the exogenous type.

Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia.

It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

      "title": "Stress response in the common lizard Lacerta vivipara Jacquin, 1787",
      "abstract": "El concepto de estres es algo complicado de definir y, sin embargo, todos nos hemos enfrentado al estres en algun momento de nuestra vida y conocemos las consecuencias del mismo. En respuesta a un estimulo o situacion potencialmente estresante se produce una respuesta en el organismo que conlleva una serie de cambios fisiologicos y conductuales que ayudan a lidiar con el estimulo o situacion percibidos, aumentando las probabilidades de supervivencia inmediata. Esta respuesta fisiologica del organismo frente al estres se traduce en un aumento en los niveles basales de glucocorticoides (cortisol o corticosterona dependiendo de la especie). La variacion que puede producirse en los niveles basales de glucocorticoides no solo esta regulada por la percepcion de un factor estresante, sino que a su vez sigue patrones estacionales y circadianos, depende de las caracteristicas propias de cada individuo (sexo, edad, etc), e incluso de factores a nivel psicologico tales como la percepcion individual sobre el control que tenga el individuo del estimulo causante de la respuesta al estres. Ademas, los efectos del aumento de los niveles basales de glucocorticoides tanto a nivel fisiologico como a nivel de comportamiento dependen a su vez de factores tales como el tiempo durante el que se prolongue su aumento o la magnitud del propio aumento. En principio, el aumento de los niveles basales de glucocorticoides en respuesta al estres es adaptativo y esta orientado a aumentar las probabilidades de supervivencia inmediata. Sin embargo, cuando esta respuesta adaptativa y puntual al estres se va prolongando a lo largo del tiempo y pasa a convertirse en algo cronico, aparecen los efectos daninos del estres que pueden incluso producir la muerte del individuo. \nDado que el estres y la respuesta al mismo tienen efectos tanto a nivel filologico como conductual, pueden afectar a la eficacia biologica tanto directa (nivel fisiologico) como indirectamente (modulando las respuestas de comportamiento). Es por tanto fundamental investigar estos posibles efectos a la hora de tratar de entender como los animales son capaces de sobrevivir y adaptarse al medio que les rodea. Igualmente importante es tratar de entender la respuesta que se produce ante los conflictos potenciales que pueden aparecer entre las acciones encaminadas a cubrir necesidades habituales y acciones encaminadas a lidiar con el factor generador de estres. Comprender como reaccionan los distintos organismos al estres y hasta donde llega el alcance de sus efectos puede ser fundamental a la hora de desentranar las interacciones entre las distintas especies y la evolucion de estas relaciones.\nA pesar del gran numero de trabajos que estudian los efectos del estres, de la respuesta al estres y de los propios glucocorticoides, aun quedan bastantes puntos por cubrir, sobre todo en relacion a los efectos sobre decisiones conductuales aparentemente sencillas pero directamente relacionadas con la eficacia biologica individual. Esta tesis pretende ayudar a aclarar algunas de estas incognitas usando como modelo a la lagartija de turbera (Lacerta vivipara Jacquin, 1787). Para ello se estudiaron, por un lado, las decisiones relacionadas con la seleccion de habitat: respuestas sencillas frente a amenazas potenciales concretas en distintas situaciones con diferentes grados de riesgo. Por otro lado, se estudiaron respuestas mas complejas frente a una de las decisiones mas importantes para la eficacia biologica de los individuos: seleccion de pareja y comportamiento relacionado con la reproduccion. Con todo esto se pretende llegar a entender mejor los patrones que rigen tanto la modulacion como la evolucion del comportamiento y de las relaciones sociales, y por tanto de las distintas estrategias vitales en esta especie como respuesta al estres, tratando de integrar los resultados obtenidos en un contexto ecologico.",

      "title": "Exertional Heat Illness during Training and Competition",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Exertional heat illness can affect athletes during high-intensity or long-duration exercise and result in withdrawal from activity or collapse during or soon after activity. These maladies include exercise associated muscle cramping, heat exhaustion, or exertional heatstroke. While certain individuals are more prone to collapse from exhaustion in the heat (i.e., not acclimatized, using certain medications, dehydrated, or recently ill), exertional heatstroke (EHS) can affect seemingly healthy athletes even when the environment is relatively cool. EHS is defined as a rectal temperature greater than 40°C accompanied by symptoms or signs of organ system failure, most frequently central nervous system dysfunction. Early recognition and rapid cooling can reduce both the morbidity and mortality associated with EHS. The clinical changes associated with EHS can be subtle and easy to miss if coaches, medical personnel, and athletes do not maintain a high level of awareness and monitor at-risk athletes closely. Fatigue and exhaustion during exercise occur more rapidly as heat stress increases and are the most common causes of withdrawal from activity in hot conditions. When athletes collapse from exhaustion in hot conditions, the term heat exhaustion is often applied. In some cases, rectal temperature is the only discernable difference between severe heat exhaustion and EHS in on-site evaluations. Heat exhaustion will generally resolve with symptomatic care and oral fluid support. Exercise associated muscle cramping can occur with exhaustive work in any temperature range, but appears to be more prevalent in hot and humid conditions. Muscle cramping usually responds to rest and replacement of fluid and salt (sodium). Prevention strategies are essential to reducing the incidence of EHS, heat exhaustion, and exercise associated muscle cramping. INTRODUCTION This document replaces, in part, the 1996 Position Stand titled \"Heat and Cold Illnesses during Distance Running\" (9) and considers selected heat related medical conditions (EHS, heat exhaustion, and exercise associated muscle cramping) that may affect active people in warm or hot environments. These recommendations are intended to reduce the morbidity and mortality of exertional heat-related illness during physical activity, but individual physiologic responses to exercise and daily health status are variable, so compliance with these recommendations will not guarantee protection. Heat illness occurs world wide with prolonged intense activity in almost every venue (e.g., cycling, running races, American football, soccer). EHS (1,27,62,64,65,109,132,154,160,164) and heat exhaustion (54,71,149,150) occur most frequently in hot-humid conditions, but can occur in cool conditions, during intense or prolonged exercise (133). Heat exhaustion and exercise related muscle cramps do not typically involve excessive hyperthermia, but rather are a result of fatigue, body water and/or electrolyte depletion, and/or central regulatory changes that fail in the face of exhaustion. This document will address recognition, treatment, and incidence reduction for heat exhaustion, EHS, and exercise associated muscle cramping, but does not include anesthesia-induced malignant hyperthermia, sunburn, anhidrotic heat exhaustion, or sweat gland disorders that are classified in other disease categories, because these disorders may or may not involve exercise or be solely related to heat exposure. Hyponatremia also occurs more frequently during prolonged activity in hot conditions, but is usually associated with excessive fluid intake and is addressed in the ACSM Exercise and Fluid Replacement Position Stand. Evidence statements in this document are based on the strength of scientific evidence with regard to clinical outcomes. Because research ethics preclude the use of human subjects in the study of EHS and other exertional heat illnesses, this document employs the following criteria: A, recommendation based on consistent and good-quality patient- or subject-oriented evidence; B, recommendation based on inconsistent or limited-quality patient- or subject-oriented evidence; C, recommendation based on consensus, usual practice, opinion, disease-oriented evidence, or a case series for studies of diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or screening. General Background: Exhaustion, Hyperthermia, and Dehydration Exhaustion is a physiologic response to work defined as the inability to continue exercise and occurs with heavy exertion in all temperature ranges. As ambient temperature increases beyond 20°C (68°F) and heat stress rises, the time to exhaustion decreases (58). From a clinical perspective it is difficult to distinguish athletes with exhaustion in cool conditions from those who collapse in hot conditions. Exercise that must be stopped due to exhaustion is likely triggered by some combination of hyperthermia-induced reduction of peripheral muscle activation due to decreased central activation (brain fatigue) (110,118), hydration level, peripheral effect of hyperthermia on muscle fatigue, depletion of energy stores, electrolyte imbalance, and/or other factors. Some combination of central, spinal cord, and peripheral responses to hyperthermia factor into the etiology of withdrawal or collapse from exhaustion during activity; the exact mechanisms have yet to be explained (90,114-116,171). The exercise-related exhaustion that occurs in hot conditions may be an extension of this phenomenon, but it is more pronounced, because depletion of energy stores occurs faster in hotter conditions, especially when athletes are not acclimatized to exercise in the heat (71). When physiologic exhaustion results in collapse, the clinical syndrome is often referred to as heat exhaustion. In both hot and cool environments, postexercise collapse also may be due to postural hypotension rather than heat exhaustion and postural changes usually resolve with leg elevation and rest in less than 30 min. There are several variables that affect exhaustion in athletes including duration and intensity of exercise, environmental conditions, acclimatization to exercise-heat stress, innate work capacity (V˙O2max), physical conditioning, hydration status, and personal factors like medications, supplements, sleep, and recent illness. In human studies of exercise time to exhaustion at a fixed exercise load, both individuals and groups show a decrease in exercise capacity (time to exhaustion) and an increase in perceived exertion as environmental temperature and/or relative humidity increase and/or as total body water decreases. The combined effects of heat stress and dehydration reduce exercise capacity and performance to a greater degree than either alone. Compared to more moderate conditions, an athlete in hot conditions must either slow the pace to avoid collapse or maintain the pace and risk collapse before the task is completed. Evidence statement. Dehydration reduces endurance exercise performance, decreases time to exhaustion, increases heat storage (11,12,16,41,57,141). Evidence category A. Exertional hyperthermia, defined as a core body temperature above 40°C (104°F) (71,85,86,149,150), occurs during athletic or recreational activity and is influenced by exercise intensity, environmental conditions, clothing, equipment, and individual factors. Hyperthermia occurs during exercise when muscle-generated heat accumulates faster than heat dissipates via increased sweating and skin blood flow (3). Heat production during intense exercise is 15-20 times greater than at rest, and can raise core body temperature by 1°C (1.8°F) every 5 min if no heat is removed from the body (105). Prolonged hyperthermia may lead to EHS, a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not promptly recognized and treated with body cooling. The removal of body heat is controlled by central nervous system (CNS) centers in the hypothalamus and spinal cord, and peripheral centers in the skin and organs. Heat flow to maintain a functional core temperature requires a temperature gradient from the body core to the body shell. If the skin temperature remains constant, the gradient increases as the core temperature increases during exercise, augmenting heat removal. If the shell or skin temperature also rises during exercise, as a result of either the environment or internal heat production, the core to skin gradient may be lost (i.e., reducing heat dissipation) and the core temperature increases. Wide variations of heat tolerance exist among athletes. The extent to which elevated body temperature below 40°C diminishes exercise performance and contributes to heat exhaustion (110) is unknown, but there is considerable attrition from exercise when rectal temperatures reach 39-40°C (144). In controlled laboratory studies, precooling the body will extend the time to exhaustion and preheating will shorten the time to exhaustion, but in both circumstances athletes tend to terminate exercise due to fatigue at a rectal temperature of about 40°C (104°F) (61). In recent years, the importance of hyperthermia in fatigue and collapse has been investigated. These studies have shown that the brain temperature is always higher than core temperature and heat removal is decreased in the hyperthermic brain compared to control (119). Also, as brain temperature increases from 37 to 40°C during exercise, cerebral blood flow and maximal voluntary muscular force output decrease with concurrent changes in brain wave activity and perceived exertion (110,118). Brain hyperthermia may explain why some exercising individuals collapse with exhaustion, while others are able to override central nervous system controls and push themselves to continue exercising strenuously and develop life-threatening EHS. It is not unusual for some athletes to experience prolonged hyperthermia without noticeable medical impairment, especially during competition. Elevated rectal temperatures up to 41.9°C (107.4°F) have been noted in soccer players, American football lineman, road runners, and marathoners who show no symptoms or signs of heat related physical changes (21,42,46,98,125,129,130,132,161,165,176). This is significant because some athletes tolerate rectal temperatures well above the widely accepted threshold for EHS of >40°C without obvious clinical sequelae (71,85,86,104,149,150). Dehydration occurs during prolonged exercise, more rapidly in hot environments when participants lose considerably more sweat than can be replaced by fluid intake (3,72,126). When fluid deficits exceed 3-5% of body weight, sweat production and skin blood flow begin to decline (19) reducing heat dissipation. Water deficits of 6-10% of body weight occur in hot weather, with or without clinically significant losses of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) (25,45,71,100,102,155,173) and reduce exercise tolerance by decreasing cardiac output, sweat production, and skin and muscle blood flow (12,41,57,71,101,141,142). Dehydration may be either a direct (i.e., heat exhaustion, exercise associated muscle cramps) or indirect (i.e., heatstroke) factor in heat illness (10). Excessive sweating also results in salt loss, which has been implicated in exercise associated muscle cramps and in salt loss hyponatremia during long-duration (>8 h) endurance events in the heat. In one study illustrating the cumulative affects of heat stress, a male soldier (32 yr, 180 cm, 110.47 kg, 41.4 mL·kg−1·min−1) participating in monitored, multiday, high-intensity exercise regimen at 41.2°C (106.0°F), 39% RH was asymptomatic with a postexercise rectal temperature of 38.3-38.9°C on days 3-7 (16). From the morning of day 5 to day 8, he lost 5.4 kg of body weight (4.8%) and had an increase of baseline heart rate, skin temperature and rectal temperature during days 6 and 7. On day 8, he developed heat exhaustion with unusual fatigue, muscular weakness, abdominal cramps, and vomiting with a rectal temperature of 39.6°C (103.3°F). His blood endorphin and cortisol levels were 6 and 2 times greater, respectively, than the other study subjects on day 8, indicating severe exercise-heat intolerance. Thirteen other males who maintained body weight near their prestudy baseline completed this protocol without incident. Because day-to-day dehydration affects heat tolerance, physical signs and hydration status should be monitored to reduce the incidence of heat exhaustion in hot environments. When humans exercise near maximal levels, splanchnic and skin blood flow decrease as skeletal muscle blood flow increases to provide plasma glucose, remove heat, and remove metabolic products from working muscles (70). As the central controls for blood flow distribution fatigue due to a core temperature increase, the loss of compensatory splanchnic and skin vasoconstriction results in reduction of the total vascular resistance and worsens cardiac insufficiency (71,84). The loss of splanchnic vasoconstriction during exhaustion has been reproduced in a laboratory rat model and supports the assertion that loss of splanchnic vasoconstriction plays a role in heat exhaustion in athletes (70,73,84). This mechanism partially explains why exertional collapse is less likely to occur in cool environments, where cool, vasoconstricted skin helps maintain both cardiac filling and mean arterial pressure, and prolongs the time to exhaustion. How EHS and heat exhaustion evolve, and in what sequence, are not completely understood (106). Some athletes tolerate hot conditions, dehydration, and hyperthermia well and are seemingly unaffected, while others discontinue activity in relatively less stressful conditions. The path that leads to EHS has been assumed to pass through heat exhaustion, however anecdotal and case study data seem to refute that notion as EHS can occur in relatively fresh athletes who develop symptomatic hyperthermia in 30-60 min of road racing in hot, humid conditions with no real signs of dehydration or heat exhaustion. If these athletes have heat exhaustion, then the duration and transition must be very short. Heat exhaustion should be protective for athletes in that, once exercise is stopped, the risk of developing exertional heat stroke is reduced because exercise-induced metabolic heat production decreases and heat dissipation to the environment increases. A program of prudent exercise in the heat along with acclimatization, improved cardiorespiratory physical fitness, and reasonable fluid replacement during exercise reduce the risk and incidence of both problems. Evidence statement. Exertional heatstroke (EHS) is defined in the field by rectal temperature >40°C at collapse and by central nervous system changes. Evidence category B. EXERTIONAL HEAT ILLNESSES Exertional Heatstroke Etiology. Exertional heatstroke (EHS) is defined by hyperthermia (core body temperature >40°C) associated with central nervous system disturbances and multiple organ system failure. When the metabolic heat produced by muscle during activity outpaces body heat transfer to the surroundings, the core temperature rises to levels that disrupt organ function. Almost all EHS patients exhibit sweat-soaked and pale skin at the time of collapse, as opposed to the dry, hot, and flushed skin that is described in the presentation of non-exertion-related (classic) heatstroke (162). Predisposing factors. Although strenuous exercise in a hot-humid environment, lack of heat acclimatization, and poor physical fitness are widely accepted as the primary factors leading to EHS, even highly trained and heat-acclimatized athletes develop EHS while exercising at a high intensity if heat dissipation is inadequate relative to metabolic heat production (18,34,71). The greatest risk for EHS exists when the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) exceeds 28°C (82°F) (20,81,156) during high-intensity exercise (>75% V˙O2max) and/or strenuous exercise that lasts longer than 1 h as outlined below in \"Monitoring the Environment.\" EHS also can occur in cool (8-18°C [45-65°F]) to moderate (18-28°C [65-82°F]) environments (14,56,132,133), suggesting that individual variations in susceptibility (14,22,55,56,66) may be due to inadequate physical fitness, incomplete heat acclimatization, or other temporary factors like viral illness or medications (81,133). Evidence statement. Ten to 14 days of exercise training in the heat will improve heat acclimatization and reduce the risk of EHS. Evidence category C. The risk of EHS rises substantially when athletes experience multiple stressors such as a sudden increase in physical training, lengthy initial exposure to heat, vapor barrier protective clothing, sleep deprivation (14), inadequate hydration, and poor nutrition. The cumulative effect of heat exposure on previous days raises the risk of EHS, especially if the ambient temperature remains elevated overnight (14,168). Over-the-counter drugs and nutritional supplements containing ephedrine, synephrine, ma huang and other sympathomimetic compounds may increase heat production (23,121), but require verification as a cause of hyperthermia by controlled laboratory studies or field trials. Appropriate fluid ingestion before and during exercise minimizes dehydration and reduces the rate at which core body temperature rises (46,60). However, hyperthermia may occur in the absence of significant dehydration when a fast pace or high-intensity exercise generates more metabolic heat than the body can remove (18,34,165). Skin disease (i.e., miliaria rubra), sunburn, alcohol use, drug abuse (i.e., ecstasy), antidepressant medications (69), obesity, age >40 yr, genetic predisposition to malignant hyperthermia, and a history of heat illness also have been linked to an increased risk of EHS in athletes (14,55,85,150). Athletes should not exercise in a hot environment if they have a fever, respiratory infection, diarrhea, or vomiting (14,81). A study of 179 heat casualties at a 14-km race over 9 yr showed that 23% reported a recent gastrointestinal or respiratory illness (128). A similar study of 10 military patients with EHS reported that three had a fever and six recalled at least one warning sign of impending illness prior to collapse (14). In American football, EHS usually occurs during the initial 4 d of preseason practice, which for most players takes place during the hottest and most humid time of the summer when athletes are the least fit. This emphasizes the importance of gradually introducing activity to induce acclimatization, carefully monitoring changes in behavior or performance during practices, and selectively modifying exercise (i.e., intensity, duration, rest periods) in high-risk conditions. Three factors may influence the early season EHS risk in American football players: (a) failure of coaches to adjust the intensity of the practice to the current environmental conditions, following the advice of the sports medicine staff; (b) unfit and unacclimatized players practicing intensely in the heat; and (c) vapor barrier equipment introduced before acclimatization. One study of 10 EHS cases (14) reported that eight incidents occurred during group running at a 12.1-13.8 km·h−1 pace in environmental temperatures of ≥25°C (77°F), suggesting that some host factor altered exercise-heat tolerance on the day that EHS occurred. Heat tolerance is often less in individuals who have the lowest maximal aerobic power (i.e., V˙O2max ≤ 40 mL·kg−1·min−1) (14,64,96). To maintain pace when running in a group, these less fit individuals must function at higher exercise intensities to maintain the group's pace and are likely to have higher rectal temperatures at the end of a run compared to individuals with a higher V˙O2max. Air flow and heat dissipation also are reduced for runners in a pack. More clinical and scientific reports of EHS involve males, and some hypotheses have been advanced (14). First, men may simply be in more EHS prone situations (i.e., military combat and American football). Second, men may be predisposed because of gender-specific hormonal, physiological, psychological, or morphological (i.e., muscle mass, body surface area-to-mass ratio) differences. Women, however, are not immune to the disorder, and the number of women who experience EHS may rise with the increased participation of women in strenuous sports. Evidence statement. The following conditions increase the risk of EHS: obesity, low physical fitness level, lack of heat acclimatization, dehydration, a previous history of EHS, sleep deprivation, sweat gland dysfunction, sunburn, viral illness, diarrhea, or certain medications. Evidence category B. Physical training, cardiorespiratory fitness, and heat acclimatization reduce the risk of EHS. Evidence category C. Pathophysiology. The underlying pathophysiology of EHS occurs when internal organ tissue temperatures rise above critical levels, cell membranes are damaged, and cell energy systems are disrupted, giving rise to a characteristic clinical syndrome (56,149). As a cell is heated beyond its thermal threshold (i.e., about 40°C), a cascade of events occurs that disrupts cell volume, metabolism, acid-base balance, and membrane permeability leading initially to cell and organ dysfunction and finally to cell death and organ failure (71,91,175). This complex cascade of events explains the variable onset of brain, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic, and muscle dysfunction among EHS patients. The extent of multisystem tissue morbidity and the mortality rate are directly related to the area in degree-minutes under the body core temperature vs. time graph and the length of time required to cool central organs to <40°C (14,20,47,48). Tissue thresholds and the duration of temperature elevation, rather than the peak core body temperature, determine the degree of injury (72). When cooling is rapidly initiated and both the body temperature and cognitive function return to the normal range within an hour of onset of symptoms, most EHS patients recover fully (47,48). EHS victims who are recognized and cooled immediately theoretically tolerate about 60°C·min (120°F·min; area under the cooling curve) above 40.5°C without lasting sequelae (see Fig. 1). Conversely, athletes with EHS who go unrecognized or are not cooled quickly, and have more than 60°C·min of temperature elevation above 40.5°C, tend to have increased morbidity and mortality. Outcomes of 20 \"light\" and 16 \"severe\" cases of EHS during military training (150) showed that coma was relatively brief in light cases when hyperthermia was limited to <1 h, despite evidence of multiple organ involvement that was confirmed with elevated serum muscle and liver enzymes (74,172). Severe EHS cases were moribund at the time of admission and died early with evident central nervous system damage (150). The primary difference between light and severe EHS cases appears to be the length of time between collapse and the initiation of cooling therapy (14,20,47,48).FIGURE 1: Cooling curves for early and late cooling interventions. The area under the early intervention curve above 40.5°C (the dashed line) in degree-minutes is approximately 60 while the area under the late intervention curve (cooling at 50 min) is >145. The prognosis based on area under the cooling curve for the late intervention is poor. Cooling can be delayed when heat stoke is not recognized early in the evaluation or if the athlete is transported before cooling is initiated. The arrow marks the start of cooling at 10 min for early intervention and 50 min for late intervention.Hyperthermia of heart muscle tissue directly suppresses cardiac function, but the dysfunction is reversible with body cooling, as demonstrated by echocardiography (133). Cardiac tissue hyperthermia reduces cardiac output, oxygen delivery to tissues, and the vascular transport of heat from deep tissues to the skin. Cardiac insufficiency or failure associated with hyperthermia accelerates the elevation of core temperature and increases tissue hypoxia, metabolic acidosis and organ dysfunction. The concurrent heating of the brain begins a cascade of cerebral and hypothalamic failure that also accelerates cell death by disrupting the regulation of blood pressure and blood flow. Interestingly, direct hyperthermia-induced brain dysfunction may lead to collapse that can be \"lifesaving,\" if stopping exercise allows the body to cool or the collapse triggers medical evaluation that leads to cooling therapy. Exercise stimulates increased blood flow to working muscle. During a maximal effort, for example, approximately 80-85% of maximal cardiac output is distributed to active muscle tissue (139). As core temperature increases during exercise, the thermoregulatory response increases peripheral vasodilatation and blood flow to the cutaneous vascular beds to augment body cooling. The brain also regulates blood pressure during exercise by decreasing blood flow to splanchnic organs. This decreased intestinal blood flow limits vascular heat exchange in the gut and promotes bowel tissue hyperthermia and ischemia. Gut cell membrane breakdown allows lipopolysaccharide fragments from intestinal gram-negative bacteria to leak into the systemic circulation, increasing the risk of endotoxic shock. Dehydration can accentuate these effects on the GI tract and speed the process. Rhabdomyolysis, the breakdown of muscle fibers, occurs in EHS as muscle tissue exceeds the critical temperature threshold of cell membranes (i.e., about 40°C). Although eccentric and concentric muscle overuse is a common cause of rhabdomyolysis, muscle membrane permeability increases due to hyperthermia and occurs earlier in exercise when the muscle tissues are hyperthermic (71,74). As heat decomposes cell membranes, myoglobin is released and may cause renal tubular toxicity and obstruction if renal blood flow is inadequate. Intracellular potassium is also released into the extracellular space, increasing serum levels and potentially inducing cardiac arrhythmias. Heating renal tissue above its critical threshold can directly suppress renal function and induce acute renal failure that is worsened by sustained hypotension, crystallization of myoglobin, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the metabolic acidosis associated with exercise (31,70,153). Incidence. The incidence of EHS varies from event to event and increases with rising ambient temperature and relative humidity. Limited data exist regarding the incidence of EHS during athletic activities. While fatal outcomes are often reported in the press, there is limited reporting of non fatal EHS unless it involves high profile athletes. In most cases, fatal EHS is a rare event that strikes \"at random\" in sports like American football, especially during the initial four days of preseason conditioning, where the incidence of fatal EHS was about 1 in 350,000 participants from 1995 through 2002 (131). Fatal EHS in American football players often occurs when air temperature is 26-30°C (78-86°F) and relative humidity is 50-80% (87). EHS is observed more often during road racing and other activities that involve continuous, high-intensity exercise. The Twin Cities Marathon, which is run in cool conditions, averages <1 EHS per 10,000 finishers (136); this incidence rises as the WBGT rises. In contrast, one popular 11.5-km road race, staged in hot and humid summer conditions (WBGT 21-27°C), averages 10-20 EHS cases per 10,000 entrants (18,34). The same race course, run in cool conditions, had no cases of EHS (A Crago, M.D., personal communication). Such a high incidence burdens the medical care system and suggests that the summer event is not scheduled at the safest time for the runners. Recognition. Immediate recognition of EHS cases is paramount to survival (68). The appearance of signs and symptoms depends on the degree and duration of hyperthermia (14,48,71,81,150). The symptoms and signs are often nonspecific and include disorientation, confusion, dizziness, irrational or unusual behavior, inappropriate comments, irritability, headache, inability to walk, loss of balance and muscle function resulting in collapse, profound fatigue, hyperventilation, vomiting, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, or coma. Thus, any change of personality or performance should trigger an assessment for EHS, especially in hot-humid conditions. In collision sports like American football, EHS has been initially mistaken for concussion; among nonathletes, EHS also has been initially misdiagnosed as psychosis. A body core temperature estimate is vital to establishing an EHS diagnosis, and rectal temperature should be measured in any athlete who collapses or exhibits signs or symptoms consistent with EHS. Ear (aural canal or tympanic membrane), oral, skin over the temporal artery, and axillary temperature measurements should not be used to diagnose EHS because they are spuriously lowered by the temperature of air, skin, and liquids that contact the skin (18,134,135). Oral temperature measurements also are affected by hyperventilation, swallowing, ingestion of cold liquids, and face fanning (33,151). At the time of collapse, systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg, tachycardia, hyperventilation, and a shocklike appearance (i.e., sweaty, cool skin) are common. Evidence statement. Ear (i.e., aural), oral, skin, temporal, and axillary temperature measurements should not be used to diagnose or distinguish EHS from exertional heat exhaustion. Evidence category B. Early symptoms of EHS include clumsiness, stumbling, headache, nausea, dizziness, apathy, confusion, and impairment of consciousness (71,85,149,161). Evidence category B. Treatment. EHS is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate whole body cooling for a satisfactory outcome (14,44,48,72,82,85,120,132,149). Cooling should be initiated and, if there are no other life-threatening complications, completed on-site prior to evacuation to the hospita",

Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain is a condition in its own right, not better accounted for by a specific classified disease. Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain is a symptom that arises from an underlying disease classified elsewhere. Such secondary musculoskeletal pain originates in persistent nociception in musculoskeletal structures from local or systemic etiologies, or it may be related to deep somatic lesions. It can be caused by inflammation, by structural changes, or by biomechanical consequences of diseases of the nervous system.

      "title": "[Consciousness functions in psychoses. Concepts, empirism and hypotheses].",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia may be described as a disease where speech, bodily language and social responsiveness are obvious expressions of a deteriorated ability to interact with the surroundings in a precise and relevant way. The lack of precision and relevance pertains to perception and recall as well as communication and action. The deficient potential for activation of the prefrontal cerebral cortex is a neurobiological correlate to the lesion of precise and relevant planning and expression. Impairment of formal thought and language in schizophrenia are suggested to result from a developmental disorder pertaining to language and concept formation (apperception). In reactive psychoses with dissociative disturbances of consciousness there is an inefficient capacity for adapting to external reality; thus relevant conscious planning and interaction with the outside world are impaired. Clinically a distractibility of a tematic nature ensues. Except for catastrophic events, psychotic reactions cannot be predicted from analysis of the actual experience--neither concerning the external nor the internal aspects of conscious awareness. Sometimes, however, previous events relating to the formation of the self may add explanatory value to the analysis of reactive psychosis. In some cases biological predisposition is the decisive determinant. The normal discrimination between sense-perception and imagination has a counterpart in the dichotomy of awareness of the outside world versus awareness of the self. The following are examples of psychotic experience where the normal ability for dichotomic discrimination may be damaged: Illusions of affect, hallucinations, Schneider's first rank symptoms, \"Anwesenheit\" and consciousness of time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are psychological therapies and medication. Traumatic events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and seeking professional help is often the only way of effectively treating PTSD. It's possible for PTSD to be successfully treated many years after the traumatic event or events occurred, which means it's never too late to seek help.\r\n\r\nBefore having treatment for PTSD, a detailed assessment of your symptoms will be carried out to ensure treatment is tailored to your individual needs. Your GP will often carry out an initial assessment, but you'll be referred to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment if you have had symptoms of PTSD for more than 4 weeks or your symptoms are severe. There are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have PTSD, such as a psychologist, community psychiatric nurse or psychiatrist. If you have mild symptoms of PTSD, or you have had symptoms for less than 4 weeks, an approach called watchful waiting may be recommended. Watchful waiting involves carefully monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse.",

The adoption of a lumping strategy for mood disorders, particularly for classifying depressive disorders, reflects the perspective of depression as a unitary construct that represents a final common pathway derived from a variety of etiological and pathophysiological sources, which accounts for the shared clinical features seen in the heterogeneous groups of depressive disorders. A diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE) is made by recognizing the characteristic syndrome of symptoms that cluster together during the same period of time. The hallmark of manic and hypomanic episodes is a discrete period of abnormally elevated, euphoric, expansive, or irritable mood that persists for at least a week in the case of mania or at least 4 days in the case of hypomania. Major depressive disorder is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes.",

Controversy has arisen concerning the actual case definition of CFS, and whether it differentiates those with CFS from other psychiatric conditions. Fatigue is a prevalent symptom in the general population, and prolonged and chronic fatigue is common complaints reported in primary care settings. Prolonged and chronic fatigue are common complaints reported in primary care settings, and many of those reporting prolonged fatigue meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder. The directional relationship between chronic fatigue and psychiatric disorders is unclear. Both fatigue and psychiatric conditions, particularly depression and anxiety, are common in many medical conditions. It is possible for some individuals to experience a period of fatigue that leads to the development of a psychiatric condition due to the physical misery of fatigue or reduced ability to meet life goals.",

The at-risk mental state is subdivided into three ultra high-risk populations for psychosis: brief intermittent psychotic symptoms; attenuated positive symptoms syndrome; genetic risk and deterioration syndrome. The incidence of psychotic disorders varies between 15-34/100,000 person-years at risk, most of the specific diagnoses are schizophrenia. The duration of untreated psychosis is the most studied variable and closely related to the assessment of the impact of early treatment on the patient's prognosis. Psychosis can be divided into primary (affective and non-affective) or secondary causes. Intervening early in the course of psychotic illness is important as centers specialized in FEP aim reduce DUP, achieve remission of the psychotic condition, reduce recurrence, and reduce the number of hospital admissions.",

But the presence and consequences of anger in the emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders) remain sparsely examined. In this review, we examine the presence of anger in the emotional disorders and find that anger is elevated across these disorders and, when it is present, is associated with negative consequences, including greater symptom severity and worse treatment response. Based on this evidence, anger appears to be an important and understudied emotion in the development, maintenance, and treatment of emotional disorders.",

Despite the fact that perinatal grief presents a set of distinctive characteristics, it is not recognized as a differentiated entity in the main diagnostic manuals (DSM-5 and ICD-11). There are a number of characteristics that make perinatal grief a different grief reaction. Characteristics that make perinatal grief a different grief reaction: General characteristics: Proximity between the beginning and the end of life, the lack of religious rituals that legitimize the loss. Physiopathological characteristics; The gestational hormone increase act in the brain favoring emotional bonding with the child and facilitating care, sustained modifications in the gabaergic, endorphinic and nitrinergic synapses in the mothers’ brains. Increased physical activity of the fetus during the third trimester increases the mother’s basal metabolism and changes her emotional reaction. Clinical characteristics; feelings of guilt, loneliness and detachment, irritability, dissociative symptoms, concern dead son and angry reactions. Objectives Search for the specific characteristics of perinatal grief and the importance of its therapeutic approach. Methods Literature review using pubmed database and scientific dissemination articles. Results Between 10 and 50% of mothers who suffer perinatal grief develop depression disorder, 50% have anxiety disorders that usually reappear with the possibility of a new pregnancy, and between 5 and 25% are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Scores for depression and depressive factors were correlated with positive, negative, and extrapyramidal symptoms within diagnostic categories. No between-group differences in the relationship of different symptom domains could be found, and no substantial relationship between depression and positive symptoms could be revealed in any diagnostic subgroup. Only the retardation factor of depression showed a significant overlap with negative symptoms; depressive core symptoms did not. Core symptoms of depression were independent from other symptoms in all investigated diagnostic groups. Depression seems to represent a heterogeneous symptom domain with unique relationships of components to positive and negative symptoms across nosological borders.

      "title": "Complicated grief: Is there a place in psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Grief is as normal reactive to a significant personal loss. It is characterized by affective, cognitive, behavioural and physiological symptoms. The grieving process is usually divided in five different stages, but in most cases presents a benign course, with decreased suffering and better adaptation to the new context. However, when high levels of emotional suffering or disability persist over a long time period, it becomes a case of complicated grief (CG), which should be adequately addressed. Objectives To review the characteristics of CG, the evidence that supports it as an individual pathological entity, and its place in current classification systems. Methods We performed a bibliographic search in Pubmed and PsychInfo, of articles written in English, Portuguese and Spanish, containing the key words: grief, bereavement, psychiatry, classification. Results The main issue regarding grief is the degree to which it is reasonable to interfere with a usually benign process. Since DSM-III bereavement has been referred to as an adaptive reaction to an important loss, which should not be diagnosed as major depressive disorder or adjustment disorder. However, DSM-5 has stated persistent complex bereavement disorder as an independent entity. In fact, CG fulfils the general criteria of every psychiatric syndrome, namely regarding specific diagnosis criteria, differential diagnosis from depressive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, and improvement with adequate treatment. Conclusion It is important to correctly approach CG, since it presents with characteristic diagnosis features and much improvement may be achieved once adequate treatment is provided.

      "title": "Stress as a one-armed bandit: Differential effects of stress paradigms on the morphology, neurochemistry and behavior in the rodent amygdala",
      "abstract": "Neuroplasticity may be defined as the ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to respond to changes in the internal and external environment and it is well established that some stimuli have the ability to facilitate or impair neuroplasticity depending on the pre-existing milieu. A classic example of a stimulus that can both facilitate and impair neuroplasticity is stress. Indeed, the ability of CNS to respond to acute stress is often dependent upon the prior stress history of the individual. While responses to acute stress are often viewed as adaptive in nature, stress reactivity in subjects with prior chronic stress experiences are often linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. In rodent studies, chronic stress exposure produces structural and functional alterations in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex that are consistent across different types of stress paradigms. Conversely, the amygdala appears to exhibit differential structural and functional responses to stress that are dependent on a variety of factors, including the type of stressor performed and the duration of the stress paradigm. This is most evident in output measures including morphological analysis of amygdala neurons, measurement of glutamatergic tone in amygdalar subdivisions and the analysis of amygdala-centric behaviors. Accordingly, this review will provide an overview of the effects of stress on the structural and functional plasticity of the rodent amygdala, especially in relation to the differential effects of repeated or chronic stress paradigms on dendritic architecture, neurochemistry of the glutamatergic system and behavior.",

      "abstract": "Except in emergencies, the physician's obligation is not to relieve pain, but to diagnose and treat pathology. Psychological factors complicate organic pain, and make the diagnosis of \"psychogenic\" pain virtually impossible on the basis of psychological tests alone. In acute (short-term) pain, anti-anxiety agents are useful, but in chronic pain antidepressants are usually more appropriate. Continuing anxiolytic drugs past the acute stage tends to potentiate depressions. In addition to antidepressants, modalities which help in the management of chronic pain are physical therapy, transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation, use of weak analgesics on a \"clock\" rather than an \"as needed\" basis, and behavior modification. Explicit agreement on the features of the doctor--patient relationship is almost always essential for successfully managing these difficult and demanding patients.",

      "title": "Apathy in schizophrenia: assessment in clinical settings and overlap with other dimensions of impairment",
      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

      "title": "The Biological Mechanism of Maternal Depression’s Negative Influences on Offspring Development: A Review",
      "abstract": "Maternal depression is a prevalent disorder among mothers: nearly 20% of women have experienced different levels of depressive symptoms during motherhood. The symptoms usually disappear by three years after their children were born, but some women experience them chronically. Maternal depression has been researched in terms of its negative influence on offspring since the 1960s. Children of chronically depressed mothers show delays in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development. Moreover, they may even face mental health challenges themselves. How does maternal depression influence offspring? Previous studies have focused on the behaviors of mothers and found that mothers with depression interact with their children in a less engaging way. Recently, more researchers started to pay attention to the biological mechanism of this maternal depression’s negative influence. Cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, is regarded as a potential pathway of the transgenerational transmission of depression. Mothers with prenatal depression have elevated cortisol level during pregnancy, which is passed down to their children. After they are born, children of depressed mothers react to stress with more dramatic changes in cortisol level and compromised stress-coping abilities. Moreover, prenatal maternal depression also seems to shape the functional connectivity of amygdala, a brain area related to stress and emotions. For life situations like schooling, competing with peers or making significant decisions, children with decreased or abnormal stress-coping abilities will be in disadvantageous positions. Attenuated stress coping abilities brought by hormonal and neural changes may be a biological mechanism for children’s lower performance in cognitive and behavioral tasks.",

      "title": "Diagnostic Criteria as Dysfunction Indicators: Bridging the Chasm between the Definition of Mental Disorder and Diagnostic Criteria for Specific Disorders",
      "abstract": "According to the introduction to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fifth Edition, each disorder must satisfy the definition of mental disorder, which requires the presence of both harm and dysfunction. Constructing criteria sets to require harm is relatively straightforward. However, establishing the presence of dysfunction is necessarily inferential because of the lack of knowledge of internal psychological and biological processes and their functions and dysfunctions. Given that virtually every psychiatric symptom characteristic of a DSM disorder can occur under some circumstances in a normally functioning person, diagnostic criteria based on symptoms must be constructed so that the symptoms indicate an internal dysfunction, and are thus inherently pathosuggestive. In this paper, we review strategies used in DSM criteria sets for increasing the pathosuggestiveness of symptoms to ensure that the disorder meets the requirements of the definition of mental disorder. Strategies include the following: requiring a minimum duration and persistence; requiring that the frequency or intensity of a symptom exceed that seen in normal people; requiring disproportionality of symptoms, given the context; requiring pervasiveness of symptom expression across contexts; adding specific exclusions for contextual scenarios in which symptoms are best understood as normal reactions; combining symptoms to increase cumulative pathosuggestiveness; and requiring enough symptoms from an overall syndrome to meet a minimum threshold of pathosuggestiveness. We propose that future revisions of the DSM consider systematic implementation of these strategies in the construction and revision of criteria sets, with the goal of maximizing the pathosuggestiveness of diagnostic criteria to reduce the potential for diagnostic false positives. Selon l'introduction du Manuel diagnostique et statistique des troubles mentaux (DSM), 5 e édition, chaque trouble doit satisfaire à la définition d'un trouble mental, qui exige la présence de préjudice et de dysfonctionnement. Construire des ensembles de critères requérant un dommage est relativement simple. Cependant, établir la présence d'une dysfonction est nécessairement inférentiel en raison du manque de connaissances des processus psychologique et biologique internes ainsi que de leurs fonctions et dysfonctions. Étant donné qu'à peu près chaque caractéristique d'un symptôme psychiatrique d'un trouble du DSM peut se manifester dans certaines circonstances chez une personne fonctionnant normalement, les critères diagnostiques basés sur les symptômes doivent être construits de manière à ce que les symptômes indiquent une dysfonction interne, et qu'ils soient donc intrinsèquement pathosuggestifs.",

      "title": "The origin and relief of common pain",
      "abstract": "Where pain of the musculoskeletal system is present, commonly, this pain is without objective evidence of disease, trauma, or disorder. Absence of an apparent cause for common pain prompts the consideration of mechanical stress as a contributing factor. The principal stress of the musculoskeletal system is postural. By posture it is usually meant the distribution of body mass with respect to gravity. Past efforts to predict chronic pain by postural analysis or to reduce such pain by strengthening, conscious control or splinting of posture has had marginal success. Past failure to relate posture to pain is attributable to (1) ubiquity of sub-optimal posture that precludes clinical comparison to those with optimal posture; (2) presupposition that the causal relation between posture and pain is of the observational class of causality rather than the manipulable kind; (3) a definition of posture that is too narrow to complete the picture; and (4) inadequate methods for reduction of postural asymmetry to an extent that is sufficient to elicit a significant and enduring effect on sub-optimal posture and related pain. Posture can be defined more broadly as the stance of the body performing within the boundaries of posture and which is mediated by the Postural Control System towards greatest stability (Fx. 1). The stance of the body is the arrangement of the body with respect to gravity and other accelerative forces. The postural boundaries are the set of forces that resist acceleration and thereby provide the limits within which one functions stably, and this resistance is currently approximated by six principal sources of resistance to acceleration: viscous, elastic, neuromuscular, rigid, viscoelastic, and inertial. The Postural Control System is located in the brainstem and modulates body stance to more economically and stably effect and resist acceleration. The rigid boundaries can be so with respect to compressive, tractive, or tensile qualities that permits three kinds of motion: translation, rotation and oscillation. An example of postural boundaries that are rigid with respect to compression and tensile character are the bones that bear weight. In contrast, ligaments provide a tractive rigidity and musculotendons a relatively elastic boundary. Joint surfaces are considered boundaries that are rigid but not perfectly so. Of fundamental importance are those joints that arc lowermost in a column of the musculoskeletal system namely: (1) the feet and ankles that support the entirety of the musculoskeletal system and; (2) the base of the sacrum that supports the vertebral spine. This broadened definition of posture leads to a greatly enhanced manipulability of posture in the upright stance and alleviation of more than two-thirds of common pain by the coherent combination of (1) manual manipulation to reduce somatic dysfunction; (2) foot orthotics to optimize the amplitude of the arches of the feet and vertically align the ankle; (3) a heel lift to level the sacral base; (4) and a group of therapeutic postures configured to minimize restriction of peripheral soft tissue reflective of the earlier posture, all aimed to optimize posture. Mediated by the postural control system, manipulation of postural boundaries accordingly modifies the structure and function of the entire musculoskeletal system. Typically, this relief is maintained by foot orthotic and heel lift alone without maintenance by manual manipulation, medication, or exercise.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain and Depression: Understanding 2 Culprits in Common: Does a Shared Pathophysiology Hold the Key to Managing These Conditions When They Coexist?",
      "abstract": "[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Any discussion of the relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic encounters an obstacle immediately: Neither has a singular pathophysiology. Furthermore, MDD and, to a significant extent, chronic are defined more by their symptoms than by a presumed etiology and pathogenesis. Why does this matter to a busy clinician? Explicitly or implicitly, we often align our treatment approaches with what we assume is the underlying pathophysiology of the conditions we are addressing. An overview of shared pathophysiology of chronic conditions and MDD therefore can be useful in practice. What is chronic pain? Defined as pain that persists past the healing phase following an injury, (1) chronic often is subdivided into 4 types (2,3): * nociceptive (caused by a lesion or potential tissue damage) * inflammatory * neuropathic (spontaneous or hypersensitivity to related to neurologic illness or injury) * functional (hypersensitivity to due to abnormal central processing of a normal input). Although fibromyalgia often is categorized as a dysfunctional syndrome, persons who suffer from it, much like those who suffer neuropathic pain, commonly report hyperalgesia (augmented sensitivity to painful stimuli), allodynia (abnormal response to non-noxious stimuli), and paresthesias. These shared clinical features of fibromyalgia and neuropathic are consistent with central sensitization, which suggests overlapping pathophysiology. (4) Comorbidity between depression and is common. A 30% to 60% co-occurrence rate of MDD and chronic has been reported. (5) Some subtypes of chronic pain, such as fibromyalgia, are so commonly comorbid with psychiatric conditions that they have spawned a scientific debate as to whether the conditions are most parsimoniously considered (1) separate illnesses with high comorbidity or (2) different symptomatic manifestations of a single underlying condition. (6) Moreover, cumulative evidence suggests that chronic and depression do not just co-occur; each one facilitates development of the other, such that chronic is a strong predictor of subsequent onset of MDD, and vice versa. When and depression are comorbid, they also tend to make treatment of each condition more difficult. For example, presents (1) a major obstacle to achieving remission when treating depression (7,8) and (2) significant risk of relapse. (9) A 3-year longitudinal study showed that painful symptoms substantially reduced the chance of recovery in a group of older depressed patients (n = 327). A substantially greater percentage of patients with MDD alone attained recovery (47%), compared with only 9% in whom MDD and painful symptoms were comorbid. (10) Furthermore, a higher level of can delay remission when treating MDD, (11) thus reducing the likelihood of an optimal outcome. (12) Understanding shared processes. Recent developments in neuroscience and psychoimmunology point to the fact that comorbid and depression might be driven by overlapping pathophysiological processes in the brain and body. In the 2 parts of this article, we (1) review scientific understanding of these shared processes and (2) demonstrate how recent advances in the epidemiology, phenomenology, and etiology of chronic and MDD provide important clues for more effective diagnosis (Part 1) and treatment (Part 2, March 2016)--and, therefore, better outcomes. Our focus is primarily on the relationship between MDD and the best-studied comorbid chronic conditions: fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, chronic back pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. The societal burden of chronic conditions is enormous A recent epidemiological study (13) projected that as many as 100 million people in the United States--30.7% of the population--suffer some form of chronic pain, including arthritis and joint pain. …",

      "abstract": "Understanding disaster psychiatry involved changing several paradigms: • The first major change involves the focus of care on those that have not yet changes of illness • In disaster situations, the diagnosis of a mental disorder arises carefully after preliminary examination. • In the acute phase psychiatrist has a duty to make psycho-education and encourage natural recovery, spontaneous rather than treat. • In terms of disaster, the physician should treat the person on site. Studies of psychiatric disorders resulting from disasters belong to a broader range of research on stress. Developed theories propose the following model: external needs (represented by the traumatic event that is the primary stressor) require a response that is based on internal or external resources. Loss or reduction of these resources, either specific (social, financial) or symbolic (beliefs, expectations) are considered as secondary stressors and can have severe impact on recovery. The incidence of PTSD and functional impairment in the general population following a disaster is significantly lower than that evidenced in the directly exposed population. CONCLUSION. Disaster psychiatry, a newer but very important branch of psychiatry has a decisive role in prevention, response and psychic recovery of people in a disaster case. It is a new way of working in psychiatry, often held to the spot of a traumatic event and which requires multiple approaches - short and long term approaches, in order to eliminate any negative consequences on the human psychic Keywords: Disaster psychiatry, stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)",

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a chronic inflammatory condition in children. JIA is defined as the presence of objective signs of arthritis in at least one joint that lasts more than six weeks in children less than 16 years of age, and other types of arthritis in children have been removed. Children with JIA may also often experience depressive episodes and other psychosocial disorders during the disease. Affective disorders in childhood can predict the recurrence of depressive episodes. In the case report, a 7-year-old was consulted because he looked sad. The sadness has been felt for two months and has worsened since two weeks ago, originally due to JIA Patients can usually carry out daily activities as usual. Nowadays, the patient has no desire and gets tired quickly, especially when doing ordinary activities; difficulty feeling joy, feeling guilty, worrying that the pain will not heal, despairing of not wanting to go to school, and being unable to follow lessons because of weakness, unable to walk, unable to write because of pain and swelling in his hands.",

      "abstract": "Although the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be found in many “normal” people, these symptoms are present to a greater extent in those affected by the disorder. In these patients, ADHD symptoms cause substantial functional impairment. Therefore, the goal of treatment is not simply to reduce core symptoms, but also to decrease the level of impairment caused by these symptoms. Common impairments in adolescents and adults include academic and occupational problems that are particularly evident in the context of tasks requiring a high degree of organization or attentional function. These impairments result in problems related to task completion, prioritizing work and other obligations, and time management, etc. These symptoms often impact successful completion of tasks in school or at work, and can also result in a variety of problems in initiating and managing relationships (Slide 1). Mood and anxiety disorders often co-occur with ADHD in adults. The accumulation of experiences related to impaired academic and/or occupational performance, and or persistent relationship problems, due to the symptoms of ADHD, can lead to either depressed mood or anxiety related to performance and/or social situations. Therefore, in treating adults with ADHD, reduction of those co-occurring symptom presentations is also an important goal.",

Ada beberapa dampak bullying yang perlu diwaspadai karena bisa memengaruhi kesehatan mental korban maupun pelaku, seperti memicu timbulnya gangguan emosi, masalah mental, gangguan tidur, penurunan prestasi, dan lain sebagainya. Kekerasan psikis yang dimaksud dapat berupa: pengucilan, penolakan, pengabaian, penghinaan, penyebaran rumor, panggilan yang mengejek, intimidasi, terror, perbuatan mempermalukan di depan umum, pemerasan; dan/atau, perbuatan lain yang sejenis. Dampak Bullying bagi korban jika tidak segera dihentikan, perilaku bullying bisa menyebabkan berbagai macam gangguan mental maupun fisik bagi korban yang mengalaminya, seperti memicu masalah mental dampak bullying bagi korban yang paling sering terjadi adalah memicu masalah kesehatan mental, seperti gangguan cemas, depresi, hingga post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Pengaruh bullying terhadap kesehatan mental ini biasanya dialami oleh korban dalam jangka waktu panjang. Gangguan Tidur Insomnia juga menjadi salah satu dampak bullying bagi korban yang tak boleh diremehkan. Pasalnya, korban bullying sering kali mengalami stres berkepanjangan yang bisa menyebabkan hyperarousal, yaitu kondisi ketika tubuh menjadi sangat waspada sehingga mengganggu keseimbangan siklus tidur dan terjaga. Penurunan prestasi anak yang mengalami bullying biasanya akan kesulitan untuk memusatkan fokus dan konsentrasinya saat sedang belajar. Korban bullying juga kerap merasa enggan untuk pergi ke sekolah karena ingin menghindari tindakan penindasan yang dialaminya. Bila",

A wide range of reactions, responses and emotions can be brought forth by such experiences. Reactions directly following the event can be characterized as shock. Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed. Moreover, children suffer from extreme mood swings, from jubilant at the one extreme to deeply sorrowful.",

      "title": "[Medically unexplained symptoms].",
      "abstract": "Patients with physical symptoms for which no medical explanation can be found are relatively common in general practice. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms are frequently frustrating to physicians both in primary and secondary care and utilize health sources disproportionately. They frequently attend both primary care units and hospitals and are usually not satisfied with the care they receive. Medically unexplained symptoms in patient populations are strongly associated with psychiatric pathology and with anxiety and depression in particular. They are also linked to personality pathology, childhood adversity, adult trauma or medically unexplained symptoms in childhood. The predictive value of alexithymia in determining these symptoms is controversial. Patients who have high negative affectivity or neuroticism tend to score high on measures of physical symptoms. These symptoms have a high degree of co-occurrence. The same person may meet the diagnostic criteria for several functional somatic syndromes simultaneously. The clinician should be aware of the cultural and social shaping of the bodily experience of these patients and hence acknowledge the somatic nature and reality of the symptoms. The clinician should make the person feel understood and establish a positive collaborative relationship. This would enable him/her to correct misconceptions about the disease and give a positive explanation of symptoms. Antidepressant therapy and cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy have been proved to be moderately effective in this group of patients. Because of the high disability that might be caused by these symptoms, psychiatrists and primary and secondary care physicians should pay careful attention to this clinical condition. These symptoms may also aid us in challenging the long-held idea of mind-body dualism which is inherent in Western biomedicine.",

Prospective studies are limited but indicate that patterns of illness behaviour in childhood are often persistent and continue or recur in adult life.

This is characteristic of the basic survival instinct; these emotions enhance the individual's memory of the traumatic experience and thus serve to help in the recognition and avoidance of similarly dangerous situations in the future. In a significant minority of individuals, however, the natural reaction to trauma becomes uncontrollably and disastrously intensified, resulting in the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD varies in severity and duration between individuals, often relating to personal characteristics and the nature of the trauma to which a person is subjected. However, several factors, namely, chronicity, impairment, comorbidity, and somatization, are significantly related to and can influence the course of PTSD and subsequent outcome.

Results of observer-rated scales of mood showed a significant reduction of scores, whereas self-assessment of mood showed no change over the study period. Negative mood states, although not severe, were more marked when the specific behavioural symptoms of binge-eating, vomiting, or purging occurred, and they increased as abnormal eating behaviours accumulated. It is suggested that the accompanying dysphoric mood states of bulimia nervosa are likely to be a secondary manifestation related to the presence of abnormal eating symptoms, and that they do no constitute a primary depressive illness.",

A third criterion has been used, including several minor symptoms [fatigue, sleep disorders, stiff ness …] and probable FMS has been defined by two criteria out of three.

The present review focuses on current research in these areas.Williams syndrome is associated with a wide range of cognitive, linguistic, social and other difficulties. When young, these deficits may appear relatively mild - for example, many children are highly sociable and talkative - but with age the impact of these difficulties becomes more evident. Thus, inappropriate social behaviours can significantly increase the risk of social exclusion and vulnerability to abuse. Their superficially good speech can lead to educational and other services failing to understand the true extent of impairments or the need for specialist support. Mental health problems, especially related to anxiety, often become an increasing challenge from adolescence onwards.The core difficulties associated with Williams syndrome have a cascading effect on many areas of development over time. However, specialist provision is rare and intervention trials are almost nonexistent. Longitudinal research is needed to identify factors associated with cognitive, social and emotional problems and to develop more effective ways of minimizing and treating difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a psychological reaction to unmanaged chronic workplace stress that occurs across three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. High rates of burnout have been observed in a wide range of professions, including healthcare and teaching; burnout has also been observed in unpaid work such as caregiving and parenting. Burnout is associated with reduced work performance and poor self-image, in addition to adverse mental and physical health outcomes ranging from major depressive disorder to type 2 diabetes. Burnout may influence health outcomes primarily via changes in health behaviors, such as increased alcohol consumption, but some evidence suggests that burnout can impact health independently of health behaviors. While the physiological underpinnings of burnout remain poorly understood, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and changes in DNA methylation patterns may be involved. Various interventions to reduce or prevent burnout have been tested; while mindfulness- and exercise-based interventions appear promising, results have been inconsistent. Further prospective research using higher-quality designs is needed to improve the scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of burnout.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The onset of chronic illness or disability can have a significant impact on the quality of life of the individual. Chronic illness and disability (CID) may be assessed by their type of onset, life threat implications, course, level of controllability, and degree of imposed functional limitations. Among the most frequently experienced functional limitations are those of: mobility, manipulation, sensory, communication, consciousness, fatigue, cognitive, and social. Numerous internal and external variables typically interact to influence the individual's psychosocial adaptation to CID. Most frequently researched psychosocial reactions to the onset of CID include those of: anxiety, denial, depression, anger, and acceptance.",

      "title": "Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder: Effects on Psychosocial Functioning and Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a common condition with a high rate of recurrence, chronicity, and staggering economic burden, including disability in the workforce.1 In 2010, MDD was the second leading medical cause of burden globally, with highest estimates of disability in people of working age.2 In Canada, the annual prevalence of MDD is 3% to 4% overall, and 79% of people with MDD report some interference with work functioning, either decreased work productivity and (or) absenteeism.1 In addition to work impairment, the psychosocial impact of MDD often affects a person’s level of functioning in family and social relationships. While there is clearly an association between improvement in depressive symptoms and functioning, symptom improvement can also be dissociated from functional improvement and work loss.3,4 Hence there has been increasing recognition that symptomatic remission is an insufficient goal of treatment for MDD and that return to premorbid psychosocial functioning should be targeted.5\r\n\r\nCognitive dysfunction refers to deficits in attention, verbal and nonverbal learning, short-term and working memory, visual and auditory processing, problem solving, processing speed, and motor functioning. Cognitive dysfunction may be a primary mediator of functional impairment in MDD.6 Cognitive complaints are core symptoms of acute MDEs, and diminished ability to think or concentrate and (or) indecisiveness are criterion items for the diagnosis of MDD. Several other core symptoms of MDD may act as mediators of cognitive dysfunction, including psychomotor retardation, amotivation, fatigue, insomnia, and mood disturbances. Deficits on neuropsychological testing are well demonstrated in people with MDD, compared with healthy subjects, with many studies and meta-analyses showing moderate effect sizes in neurocognitive domains of processing speed, attention, executive function, learning, and memory7,8 as well as in cognitive affective bias. Cognitive affective bias reflects distorted information processing and (or) focus moving away from positive stimuli and toward negative stimuli,7 and abnormal responses to negative feedback and decision making.9\r\n\r\nIt is also apparent that, while cognitive dysfunction in MDD may improve with treatment and resolution of depressive symptoms, cognitive deficits can still be detected even in periods of symptom remission. In a 3-year, follow-up study of patients with MDD, the proportion of time with cognitive complaints was reported as 94% during acute depressive episodes; this remained at 44% despite full or partial symptom remission during treatment.10 Cognitive performance on tests of immediate memory, attention,11 and processing speed12 was reported to be inferior in patients with MDD who met criteria for remission, compared with healthy subjects. Meta-analyses show that cognitive deficits in executive function are still present in remitted patients,13,14 which may explain persistent psychosocial impairment in remission.\r\n\r\nWhile it is beyond the scope of our paper to review the underlying pathophysiology, recent evidence points to neural mechanisms that also support a neurocognitive model of depression.15 Overall, cognitive dysfunction, work, and psychosocial limitations are prevalent in patients with current and remitted depression.10 Therefore, we hypothesize that cognitive dysfunction may be a major mediator of psychosocial limitations in patients with MDD.\r\n\r\nWe aimed to review recent evidence that cognitive dysfunction is a mediator of functional disability in MDD, and that pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy specifically target the cognitive domain. We conducted a PubMed literature search for the period from January 2000 up to January 2014 to identify relevant studies (search strategy available on request) for this review.",

These depressions may be either major or minor in type and usually remit within the first year after the stroke. In addition to emotional suffering, poststroke depression has been associated with inhibited physical recovery, impaired cognitive functioning, and increased mortality. Determining whether these consequences of stroke may be improved by treatment of depression constitutes both a major challenge and an enormous opportunity for new approaches to poststroke pharmacotherapy. Previous controlled and uncontrolled treatment trials have provided partial support for the hypothesis that mood, cognitive, physical, and survival consequences of poststroke depression may be improved by antidepressant therapy.",

      "title": "The Neurobiology of Affiliation: Implications for Autism",
      "abstract": "Abstract A decade from now, when we look back at the early years of affective neuroscience, we may wonder about our conspicuous preoccupation with “negative” emotions. Fear and anxiety, sadness and depression, anger and aggression have received considerable attention in the past few years. By contrast, the neurobiology of “positive” affects, such as joy, affiliation, and love, seem almost taboo subjects. No doubt our focus on negative emotions derives from a need to understand psychopathological states. Most major forms of psychopathology, such as the anxiety and affective disorders, involve an excess of one of the negative emotions. Recently, we have begun to appreciate that most mental disorders also involve a loss of positive affect, whether it is the anhedonia of major depressive disorder, the absence of affiliation in autism, or the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. An important first step toward accounting for the loss of positive affects will be to understand their normal expression. Clearly, joy is not just the absence of sadness, and love/affiliation is much more than the absence of hate or fear. Positive affects will undoubtedly have a circuitry and a neurochemistry that is unique from what we have already learned about fear, sadness, and anger. But how can we study these complex affects with the modern tools of neurobiology? In this chapter, I review one approach based on animal studies. This approach demonstrates that current molecular and cellular tools, when combined with comparative, ethologically relevant studies, can reveal some intriguing leads into the neural basis of affiliation in nonhuman animals. Affiliation is an ethological term generally used to describe membership in a conspecific group. In fact, there are two quite different uses of the term affiliation. The first, relevant to all species, is sociality. Some highly affiliative species, including our own, cluster in flocks or herds in which group membership is essential for survival. Other, nonaffiliative species, such as orangutans or certain cats, are loners, living solitary lives except when mating or caring for young. A second use of the term affiliation describes specific aspects of behavior within a species. In this latter sense, affiliative behaviors include side-by-side or huddling behavior, parent-infant attachment, and pair bonding. Because these behaviors are most relevant to understanding the basis of the powerful human experiences of acceptance, attachment, and love, this chapter focuses on this second meaning of affiliation.",

It then becomes necessary to determine whether this symptom is indeed secondary to some other problem of a situational, developmental, or psychiatric nature, or whether any associated emotional distress is secondary to study difficulties deriving from poor study habits. In this paper a pragmatic distinction has been made between Primary Study Difficulty and Secondary Study Difficulty, and between various subcategories of the latter. Useful as such a classification may be it remains, like most classifications, somewhat arbitrary and artificial. In any given case it is usually possible to relate a student's presenting complaints to a variety of factors, and to discern a subtle intertwining of cognitive and emotional determinants. The diagnostic and remedial needs of students with such problems are therefore best served by a clinic which involves psychiatrists and psychologists working in close collaboration.",

      "title": "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder – An Overview",
      "abstract": "IntroductionPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to any event that result in psychological trauma.This event may involve the threat of death to oneself or to someone else, or to one's own or someone else's physical, sexual, or psychological integrity, overwhelming the individual's ability to cope.As an effect of psychological trauma, PTSD is less frequent but more enduring than the more commonly seen acute stress response.Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a persistent and sometimes crippling condition and develops in a significant proportion of individuals exposed to trauma, and untreated, can continue for years.Its symptoms can affect every life domain -physiological, psychological, occupational, and social.Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was first introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1980, making it one of the more recently accepted psychiatric disorders.PTSD is one of the few DSM diagnoses to have a recognizable etiologic agent, in that it must develop in direct response to a severe (sudden, terrifying, or shocking) life event (American Psychiatric Association 2000).Since the introduction of PTSD into DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association 1980), the disorder has been documented in children exposed to traumas such as domestic violence, natural disasters, medical trauma (such as hospitalization or medical procedures performed on children), war, terrorism, and community violence.According to the American Psychological Association, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as \"an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened.Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, such as terrorist attacks, motor vehicle accidents, rape, physical and sexual abuse, and other crimes, or military combat [1].\"PTSD is a problem in which the human brain continues to react with nervousness after the horrific trauma even though the original trauma is over.Brain can react by staying in \"overdrive\" and being hyperalert in preparation for the next possible trauma.Sometimes the brain continues to \"remember\" the trauma by having \"flashbacks\" about the event or nightmares even though the trauma was in the past. Historical backgroundReports of battle-associated stress reactions appeared as early as the 6th century BC.One of the first descriptions of PTSD was made by the Greek historian Herodotus.In 490 BC www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 4 Herodotus described, during the Battle of Marathon, an Athenian soldier who suffered no injury from war but became permanently blind after witnessing the death of a fellow soldier.In the early 19th century military medical doctors started diagnosing soldiers with \"exhaustion\" after the stress of battle.This \"exhaustion\" was characterized by mental shutdown due to individual or group trauma.Soldiers during the 19th century were not supposed to be scared or show any fear in the midst of battle.The only treatment for this \"exhaustion\" was to bring the afflicted back for a bit for a short term therapy and then send them back into battle.During the intense and frequently repeated stress, the soldiers became fatigued as a part of their body's natural shock reaction.According to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, \"One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.\"Previous diagnoses now considered historical equivalents of PTSD include railway spine, stress syndrome, shell shock, battle fatigue, or traumatic war neurosis.Although PTSD-like symptoms have also been recognized in combat veterans of many military conflicts, the modern understanding of PTSD dates from the 1970s, largely as a result of the problems that were still being experienced by US military veterans of the war in Vietnam.In its initial DSM-III (formulation 1980), a traumatic event was conceptualized as a catastrophic stressor that was outside the range of usual human experience.The framers of the original PTSD diagnosis had in mind events such as war, torture, rape, the Nazi Holocaust, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and volcano eruptions) and human-made disasters (such as factory explosions, airplane crashes, and automobile accidents).They considered traumatic events as clearly different from the very painful stressors that constitute the normal vicissitudes of life such as divorce, failure, rejection, serious illness and financial reverses.(By this logic adverse psychological responses to such \"ordinary stressors\" would, in DSM-III terms, be characterized as Adjustment Disorders rather than PTSD.)This dichotomization between traumatic and other stressors was based on the assumption that although most individuals have the ability to cope with ordinary stress, their adaptive capacities are likely to be overwhelmed when confronted by a traumatic stressor.The DSM-III diagnostic criteria for PTSD were revised in DSM-III-R (1987) and DSM-IV (1994) [2].A very similar syndrome is classified in .Since 1980 there has been a great deal of attention devoted to the development of instruments for assessing PTSD.Although an optimal evaluation of a patient for PTSD consists of a face-to-face interview by a mental health professional trained in diagnosing psychiatric disorders, several instruments are available to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).These include screening tools, diagnostic instruments, and trauma and symptom severity scales.For example, there are brief screening tools, such as the 4-item Primary Care PTSD Screen, developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; self-report screening instruments, such as the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale; and structured or semi-structured interviews, such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (DIS-IV), and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI), www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 6 Country PTSD DALY rate, overall PTSD DALY rate, females PTSD DALY rate, males Thailand 59 86 30 Indonesia",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

Myoclonus, although reported in some series, has never been characterized. We studied 10 RS patients, age 3 to 20 years, and observed myoclonus in 9. Severity of myoclonus did not correlate with that of the other symptoms or with age. Multifocal, arrhythmic, and asynchronous jerks mainly involved distal limbs. Electromyographic bursts lasted 48 ± 12 msec. Burst‐locked electroencephalographic averaging generated a contralateral centroparietal premyclonus transient preceding the burst by 34 ± 7.2 msec. Motor evoked potentials showed normal latencies, indicating integrity of the corticospinal pathway. Somatosensory evoked potentials were enlarged. The C‐reflex was hyperexcitable and markedly prolonged (62 ± 4.3 msec), mainly due to increase in cortical relay time (28.4 ± 4.5 msec). We conclude that RS patients show a distinctive pattern of cortical reflex myoclonus with prolonged intracortical delay of the long‐loop reflex.",

Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

The anxiety may be sustained, but more often is episodic from a few minutes to hours or days. The chief symptoms are those of anxiety and its physical concomitants in the absence of other illness and independent of specific situations; they include breathing and swallowing difficulties, palpitations, dizziness, irritability, and faintness. Depression, phobias, and obsessions are common complications. The syndrome occurs in young adults of both sexes and its course may be acute or chronic. Acute forms may present in epidemics which are culture bound, e.g., Koro and epidemic hysteria. Chronic forms can fluctuate and persist for many years without other physical or psychiatric syndromes appearing. Between attacks the patient feels fairly well. Prevalence is estimated at 2 to 5 per cent of the normal population and 6 to 27 per cent of psychiatric outpatients. The syndrome requires differentiation from depressive and phobic disorders and from physical conditions which produce anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms vary moment-to-moment within a day. One factor that may influence these variations is chronotype. Evening chronotypes prefer to engage in activities (e.g., sleep, physical and social activity) later in the day, and evening chronotype is implicated in psychopathology, including anxiety-related disorders. However, it is unknown whether chronotype influences diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and whether these effects are amplified in individuals with a probable anxiety-related disorder. We examined the diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and daily activities in morning and evening chronotypes with and without probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a community sample of adults (N = 410). Evening chronotypes reported higher anxiety symptoms, particularly in the evening hours, and lower engagement in daily activities, predominantly in the morning hours. Evening chronotypes with probable GAD or OCD reported worse anxiety symptoms in the evening. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms and engagement in daily activities fluctuate considerably across the day, and these patterns differ depending on chronotype. Evening chronotypes have more anxiety symptoms in the evening, despite preferring this time of day. Personalized treatment approaches that consider chronotype and target certain times of day may be efficient in alleviating peaks in anxiety symptoms.",

Whereas most symptoms of the initial prodromal condition appear to be rather un-specific and hard to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions especially depressive ones, some syndromes seem to enable an early detection and thus an indicated prevention. These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other. Whereas the former are thought to delineate an advanced prodromal state, the latter can occur early in course and even at the beginning of the transition sequence to first-rank symptoms. This review will outline the current state of the art of a phase specific early detection and intervention based on these syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop following exposure to a traumatic event, including terrifying or life-threatening situations such as sexual assault or natural disasters.The disorder is characterized by a reaction of intense fear, helplessness, or horror when the individual experiences, testifies about, or is faced with one or more events that involve death, severe wounds, or a threat to one's own or another's physical integrity.One of the most important symptoms of PTSD is the revival of the traumatic event, which has been interpreted as an inability to downregulate negative emotions.Neuroimaging studies that probed the ability to regulate emotions in healthy volunteers have found a pattern characterized by activation of the prefrontal cortex associated with a reduction in amygdala activity.This suggests an inhibitory prefrontal cortexamygdala circuit that underlies emotional regulation.The hypothesis that increased amygdala activation associated with PTSD results from dysfunction in the inhibitory mechanism exerted by the prefrontal cortex has been the topic of debate.The present review investigates the validity of dysfunction in the prefrontal-amygdala pathway in PTSD.The studies provide evidence that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex exhibit distinct activation patterns in PTSD, thus supporting the model of a dysfunctional circuit.Inconsistencies in the literature may be attributable to distinct PTSD subgroups, different experimental approaches, different contrasts employed in neuroimaging studies, and small sample sizes.",

Life‐events, personality, previous experience of and coping strategies for pain, together with iatrogenic factors and parental attitudes, comprise the psychosocial context in which fear of pain may persist.

Pain avoidance, if unrecognized and untreated, may then become a pathological factor itself, independent of any concomitant organic changes and causing progressive stiffness, weakness and reinforcement of the invalid status.",

      "abstract": "Generalized, persistent, and free-floating anxiety was first described by Freud in 1894. The diagnostic term generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was not in classification systems until the publication of the diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders, third edition (DSM-III) in 1980. Initially considered a residual category to be used when no other diagnosis could be made. The term GAD is not accepted as a distinct diagnostic category yet. Since 1980, revisions to the diagnostic criteria for GAD in the DSM-III-R, DSM-IV and DSM-5 classifica- tions have slightly redefined this disorder. The classification is fluid. This article reviews the development of diagnostic criteria for defining GAD from Freud to DSM-5. Excessive worry- ing impairs the individual's capacity to do things quickly and efficiently, whether at home or at work. The worrying takes time and energy; associated symptoms of feeling keyed up or edge, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Individuals whose presentation meets crite- ria for GAD are likely to have met, or currently meet, criteria for unipolar depressive disor- ders. Comorbid depression are common in GAD and negatively impact treatment outcome.",

      "abstract": "This paper suggests that the behaviours associated with the formal diagnosis of the “disinhibited” form of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) might be seen as a functional adaptation rather than a mental health problem, a facultative response enhancing the probability of survival that is triggered by certain conditions. Although disinhibited RAD is most commonly observed in institutionalised children, similar behaviours may also be a part of the emotional difficulties displayed by some fostered and adopted children (the latter includes those once institutionalised), and these may demonstrate not so much a discrete attachment disorder as either the need to fend for oneself following loss of dedicated caregiving or a lack of opportunity to build specific intimate relationships with dedicated caregivers. In many cases this may be inextricably mixed with the neurobiological and psychological seqelae of maltreatment. Indiscriminate attachment behaviour, from this proposed evolutionary perspective, is less a syndrome of mental ill-health than an astute survival manoeuvre following being orphaned, abandoned or fecklessly reared. Such a response, allied to the innate facility to access caregiving from different adults, could be expected to be initiated by specific events as are the other attachment configurations. Classing disinhibited RAD as an adaptation has implications for helping children brought up under extreme duress when their caregiving environment has changed for the better.",

      "title": "Quality of Life of Older Adults with Urinary Incontinence",
      "abstract": "Health-related quality of life is now recognized as an important patient outcome in response to a disease, treatment, or procedure. The term health-related quality of life (HRQL) refers to a multidimensional construct involving the individual's evaluation or judgment about subjective well-being and objective attributes of functioning. Although there are varying definitions of HRQL, a group of international experts agreed that the fundamental dimensions of HRQL are physical, mental/psychological, and social health, as well as global perceptions of function and well-being.1 Other dimensions of HRQL might also be important, depending on the purpose of an investigation and the specific health condition being studied. These dimensions include cognitive or neuropsychologic functioning, sexual functioning and intimacy, personal productivity, symptoms, pain, energy/vitality, sleep, and self-esteem. Urinary incontinence and its associated symptoms can have a significant impact on the HRQL of older adults. Evidence suggests that incontinence can affect HRQL in diverse and far-reaching ways and that there is considerable variability among individuals in their perceptions and responses to urinary symptoms.2 In addition, there are differences in HRQL impairment, depending on the type of incontinence, the age, and possibly the gender of the patient.2 Surprisingly, research has not consistently documented a strong relationship between incontinence severity (typically measured in the number of incontinent episodes or grams of fluid lost on a pad test) and HRQL impact. The explanation for the lack of a strong relationship between these two types of patient outcome measures is unclear. In this issue are two reports that examine aspects of the HRQL of community-dwelling older adults with urinary incontinence. The reports approach the topic from different perspectives and research methodologies, yet each report makes an important contribution that furthers our understanding related to the impact of incontinence on one or more domains of quality of life. Catherine DuBeau and her colleagues3 present descriptions of the impact of urge incontinence in the lives of older women and men obtained through qualitative research methodologies. The ultimate goal of their work is to develop a HRQL instrument that has strong validity for use in urge incontinent older patients. These authors compared patient-defined areas of impact obtained through focus group interviews with provider/expert areas of impact obtained from the literature and included in published condition-specific quality of life instruments. DuBeau et al. also examined the patients'descriptions to identify the possible role of patients'explanatory style as a mediator of the impact of incontinence on HRQL. DuBeau et al.'s study represents the second generation of instrument development work in research on the HRQL of incontinent patients. She and her colleagues are to be commended for their sound approach to the development of a new condition-specific HRQL instrument. Because HRQL is, by definition, the patient's own perspectives on his/her functioning and well-being, the use of focus group and content analysis methodologies is appropriate. As a next step in establishing content validity, the authors could either take the items identified in the focus groups back to the participants or take them to a new group of older adults with urge incontinence for further validation. Another critical step, one which is usually skipped in HRQL instrument development, would be to have the participants evaluate the importance of each of the specified items in relation to the other items. This would help identify whether each item should be weighted equally or given a different value in calculating subscale scores. See also p 683 and p 693 One limitation in DuBeau et al.'s study was the use of a nonrepresentative sample, i.e., the sample was all white and predominantly of high socioeconomic status. Cultural and economic differences could affect perceptions of the impact of incontinence in participants'lives. Despite this limitation, the results from this study emphasize the differences between the way experts and patients view HRQL and provide new information on the impact of urge incontinence on older adults. More than half of the items identified by DuBeau and her colleagues were not described previously, which may be related to the different conceptual orientations of researchers about what constitutes HRQL versus what factors influence it. For example, DuBeau and her colleagues include a domain on coping. In some theoretical perspectives, this might be considered a personal trait that is not a characteristic of HRQL, whereas in others it might be viewed as a mediating variable of HRQL.4 Also, specific items identified — such as the inevitability of incontinence, that incontinence is a psychological not a physical problem, the association of incontinence with women's biology, and fear of aging — reflect an individual's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs rather than HRQL. A significant finding in this study was the greater influence of urge incontinence on coping with embarrassment and the interruption of activities compared with the performance of activities, which is used typically in geriatric assessment models. A novel aspect of DuBeau et al.'s study was the examination of explanatory style, i.e., the habitual manner in which persons explain how and why uncontrollable adverse events such as illness occur to them, as a possible mediator of HRQL. Previous research suggests that explanatory style correlates with the range of responses of individuals to illnesses. It makes sense that explanatory style affects responses to incontinence. The authors'findings indicate an association between negative explanatory statements and HRQL items and suggest that there may be gender differences. However, the results on gender differences must be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of men in the sample. No consistent relationship was found between incontinence severity, as measured by the number of incontinent episodes on a voiding diary, and explanatory style. Theodore Johnson II and his colleagues5 conducted a secondary analysis from data collected in the 1990–1991 National Survey of Self Care and Aging to assess whether urinary incontinence and its severity were associated with the self-rating of poor health. The National Survey of Self-Care and Aging is a random sampling of geographic clusters of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older in the contiguous United States. This study had a sample size of 3485, with oversampling of the oldest-old age group and men to enable subgroup analyses. Findings from Johnson et al.'s study confirm earlier research about the relationship between incontinence and health perceptions. This is an important milestone. Urinary incontinence was associated with poor self-rated health for white subjects who had no instrumental activities of daily living impairments even after controlling for age, activity of daily living status, and comorbid health conditions. The odds of rating one's health poor were doubled if the incontinence was mild to moderate and quadrupled if the incontinence was severe. Previous research examining the relationship between incontinence and self-rated health status has been criticized because of the failure to account adequately for frailty. Johnson et al.'s study did control carefully for functional status and comorbidity and found that urinary incontinence is associated with poor self-rated health independent of frailty. Although analyzed carefully and interpreted cautiously, this study has two main limitations. First, it was a post hoc comparison dependent on cross-sectional data collected in a larger study for a different purpose. Thus, as the authors pointed out, conclusions about causality are problematic. Prospective studies are needed. Second, the quantitative nature of the study, with fixed choice responses to a survey instrument, does not allow for the breadth of responses that might come from in-depth interviews of incontinent individuals, allowing better understanding of why they rated their health as poor. Was it because of the incontinence and its associated symptoms or consequences, or are there other unexplained factors that might have been missed? Future research should address the frame of reference used by incontinent adults in their self-ratings of health. Krause and Jay6 found that global ratings of health are interpreted in different ways by different people and that these ways may depend on race and, possibly, education. Understanding why persons rate health in a particular way may be helpful in determining appropriate interventions. Additional studies on the HRQL of incontinent older adults are greatly needed. There is much that we still need to learn about how age, gender, and lower urinary tract pathophysiology alter the impact of incontinence on HRQL, as well as the factors that influence HRQL. However, these studies should be based on a clear conceptualization of HRQL in which the determinants of quality of life are distinguished from the dimensions of quality of life. Wilson and Cleary7 have presented a useful model that helps categorize clinical variables and shows their relationships with measures of HRQL. In their model, various patient outcomes are linked with causal pathways to show how intervening variables mediate the effect on HRQL. Their model includes five levels of patient outcomes: biological and physiological factors, symptoms, functioning, general health perceptions, and quality of life. Characteristics of the individual (e.g., personality, motivation, values, preferences, and symptom amplification) and of the environment (e.g., psychological, social, and economic supports) influence the five levels in complex ways. In addition, nonmedical factors may directly influence an individual's rating of overall quality of life. Translating their model to incontinence research, the biological and physiological factors might include the underlying pathophysiology of the lower urinary tract, urodynamic variables, and pelvic support and pelvic muscle strength characteristics. Symptoms are the patient's perception of abnormal physical, emotional, or cognitive states and are influenced by demographic and cultural factors. Examples of these include lower urinary tract symptoms such as urgency, frequency, nocturia, and incontinence. Functioning refers to the individual's ability to carry out his/her normal activities. General health perceptions would be the individual's self-rating of health status. Overall quality of life would be the individual's life satisfaction as a whole. In conclusion, the qualitative study by DuBeau and her colleagues and the survey analysis by Johnson and his associates complement each other, enriching our understanding of the way incontinence is interpreted and processed by patients. Further depth and refinement in our understanding of the impact of incontinence can lead to more focused and more effective interventions that will improve the HRQL of the millions of Americans who suffer from incontinence.",

MUS are found across all specialties, can cause similar levels of disability to symptoms caused by disease, and may utilize high levels of healthcare resource due to frequent attendance and repeated investigation. These conditions include conversion disorder, illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis), somatic symptom disorder, and factitious disorder. While the term MUS recognizes the uncertainty around causation, it is less helpful clinically. The cornerstone of management is to assist the patient in finding an explanation that is helpful, enabling collaborative management of symptoms and ultimately allowing for a reduction in utilization of healthcare. We also describe cacosmia, a person's delusional belief that an unpleasant odour can be smelt, versus olfactory reference syndrome, where the person believes he/she emits the unpleasant odour. This can develop for a variety of medical, psychiatric, or psychological causes, but for some a cause may never be identified. We describe an approach to management for clinicians encountering patients with this distressing symptom.",

      "abstract": "Contrary to the previously spread myth, pregnancy does not protect women from either relapses of previously diagnosed psychiatric illness nor development of new ones. Prevalence of psychiatric illnesses during pregnancy is similar to that in the general population, whereas that number significantly increases in the postpartum period. Peripartum has its own uniqueness for both etiology and presentation of different psychopathological conditions. Multiple studies have been published describing affective, anxiety, and psychotic illnesses in peripartum. Specific psychosocial circumstances during that time along with multiple physiological changes occurring in female body in that reproductive period predispose women with and without previous psychiatric histories, to various psychiatric illnesses. Several potential contributing factors for these phenomena have been proposed so far. One of the most frequently studied ones has been the drastic hormonal shift occurring during peripartum that could directly increase the sensitivity for developing mood instability, anxiety and/or psychotic symptoms. Genetic predisposition and previously existing psychiatric disorder especially those occuring during specific reproductive phases significantly increase the risk as well. Presentation of psychiatric illnesses during peripartum has its’ particularities which are essential to understand of in order to provide an appropriate care. Being aware of the potential etiology and risk factors as well as sensitivity to psychopathology of some women in peripartum could greatly improve treatment as well as open up avenues for prevention in this area. Unrecognized and untreated psychiatric illnesses in peripartum have serious consequences.",

The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable psychiatric condition, that is, associated with lifelong distress and impairment. There has been a long-standing interest in the early-life origins of BD, not least because as many as 50% of adults with BD report onset of their symptoms during childhood and adolescence.1 In this article, we present evidence on the assessment and treatment of BD and related conditions in young people. We also discuss the recent controversy about BD in children and adolescents that has led to the introduction of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.\n\n### Diagnostic features\n\nBD is characterised by episodes, that is, distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During these episodes, patients experience symptoms such as grandiosity, distractibility, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, an increase in activity, flight of ideas and psychomotor agitation. These episodes are required to last by at least 4 days to diagnose hypomania or at least 7 days to diagnose mania. The insistence on episodic mood changes is crucial and prevents clinicians from rating symptoms such as the chronic concentration problems of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as evidence for mania.2 Manic episodes are extremely rare in children and relatively rare in adolescents according to epidemiological studies in the UK and the USA.3\n\n### Acute treatment\n\nPharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute mania. Aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mania in children and adolescents, and olanzapine in approved only for adolescents.

      "title": "Depression as a determinant of quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which mainly affects women and young adults in their most productive years of life. Given to fact that the disease is unpredictable and has uncertain outcomes, the grater are physical and emotional efforts that an individual has to take, and that inevitably causes additional exhaustion. Assessment of disease severity based only on an objective clinical finding is not enough, because it does not give insight into the subjective experience of disease symptoms and difficulties with which these patients meet in everyday life life. Most MS sufferers most likely will experience a wide range of physical, psychological and social problems. Physical disability, fatigue, motor incapacity and sexual dysfunctions that occur with the progression of the disease, most often lead to the deterioration of the quality of life in people with MS. In addition to these factors, changes in psychological status are inevitable. Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity of MS that worsens the health condition of the patient. Studies on psychiatric comorbidities and ways of coping with MS generally highlight the connection between depression and alexithymia in MS. Prevalence alexithymia in MS patients goes up to 50%, it is associated with anxiety and significantly contributes to the severity and severity of depression. When it comes to the therapy of depression in MS of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) is recommended as the first line of treatment, but also the application of pharmacotherapy i.e. administration of sertraline and escitalopram with short-term use of alprazolam, and more recently, more and more studies are investigating neuroprotective effect of antidepressants, and recommend the use of fluoxetine. Directing preventive measures to improving social activities and prevention institutionalization ie. combining medical rehabilitation, psychosocial help and social support prevent that the disease from becoming a disability leading to complete isolation. It is also necessary to direct resources to adequate treatment of depression as determining factor of quality of life, mental health and prognostic factor of the clinical picture and course of MS.",

In cocaine use, there also exist paranoid delusions and hallucinations. While there is no definitive standard of treatment to address SIPD, management of such disorders tends to vary depending on substances used, clinical symptomatology, dosage, frequency, and chronicity, among other variables. Given that the relationship between SIPD and the development of several mental illnesses is well established, a long-term follow-up period is needed to identify, prevent, and effectively treat further relapses.

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (mdd) can be elicited by various kinds of stress, such as negative life events, chronic stress and experiences of abuse early in life. These stressors interact with personality traits and with a genetic predisposition to depression, thereby bringing about mdd. Therefore, the neurobiology of depression cannot be separated from the neurobiology of stress system. A substantial number of publications have in fact demonstrated that mdd patients show abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, which is a key element of the stress response. Such disturbances are exacerbated by chronic stress, early experiences of abuse and even prenatal exposure to stress. On the other hand, genetic variations can play a role in the hpa axis dysfunction and in vulnerability to depression. Evidence is emerging that certain genes are directly involved in the functioning of the hpa axis. Other genetic factors, not directly related to the hpa axis, are probably relevant as well, the best known example being the serotonin transporter gene.",

An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients.

Children and adolescents with ODD may have trouble controlling their temper and are often disobedient and defiant toward others. There are no tools specifically designed for diagnosing ODD, but multiple questionnaires can aid in diagnosis while assessing for other psychiatric conditions. ODD is often comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and mood disorders, including anxiety and depression. Behavioral therapy for the child and family members improves symptoms of ODD. Medications are not recommended as first-line treatment for ODD; however, treatment of comorbid mental health conditions with medications often improves ODD symptoms. Adults and adolescents with a history of ODD have a greater than 90% chance of being diagnosed with another mental illness in their lifetime. They are at high risk of developing social and emotional problems as adults, including suicide and substance use disorders. Early intervention seeks to prevent the development of conduct disorder, substance abuse, and delinquency that can cause lifelong social, occupational, and academic impairments.",

The present research consist in a study on the constant factor that is subjacent in any effect of four prime movers of the mental disorders and that bear to the different organic illnesses through their concomitant relation with these effects and that there induce the quantum states that generate to the symptom. The quantum medicine studies of the mind - body (1), and their cure through programmed actions by path integrals and their mono-pharmacists of integral medicine (1), establish that a symptom feeds on the proper memories of stopped psychic situations (2) (not assimilated in any time interval) being this energy a product of factors of anxiety that is subjacent in a region of unstable space - time and that can be shaped like a space of singular perturbation which dimension can be calculated by inverse methods. The value of the product of the factors of anxiety is the dimension of the space of the symptom, and their cure is the inverse action of the sum of nano-metric actions of the integral mono-pharmacists to relieve the anxiety through strengthening the will of the mind. The elimination of these factors is transmitted by the mind - body creating organic vitality and therefore health. Finally under this new principles, is designed a quantum device that might detect symptoms using bosonic models, through the proliferation of free electrons and exceeding the thermodynamic limit of Van Hove.",

      "abstract": "The catastrophic reaction (CR; a disruptive and uncontrolled behavior triggered by anger, irritability, and hostility) and emotionalism (a condition of uncontrolled crying or laughing) are disorders of the emotional regulation and expression, the prevalence of which is underestimated in neurology. Their occurrence is an additional factor of poor outcome for neurologic patients. Although they have been recognized and completely described in their clinical manifestations more than a century ago, many issues remain unsolved regarding their pathogenesis and the respective role of the brain damage and psychological factors. Thus, if pathological crying and laughing can be linked to one or more lesions within the corticospinal tracts, the emotional lability and CR have uncertain connections within specific functional brain systems and seem to be influenced by personality factors or depression and anxiety generated by coping with a serious neurological disease. These epistemological difficulties are also the consequence of some methodological limits of the questionnaires and scales, which diagnose these disorders and for which the cut-off values between the normal and pathological condition could be questioned. Thus, their assessment requires new psychophysical. The CR and emotionalism manifest in association with several different neurological disease (degenerative, vascular, inflammatory, epilepsy) and psychiatric conditions as psychosis, mania, and mood disorders. Across these different diseases, the findings of common patterns of lesion location, cognitive dysfunction, emotional changes, and behavioral responses to new paradigms might clarify the pathogenesis and orient the treatment.",

Depression, a complex psychiatric disorder, is characterized by symptoms such as depressed mood, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and loss of interest in daily activities. On the other hand, chronic pain is a debilitating condition that persists for at least three months, compromising the processing of painful stimuli in the central nervous system. Scientific studies have shown a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic pain, as well as the presence of chronic pain in individuals with depression, suggesting a possible cause-and-effect relationship. Biopsychosocial mechanisms, including chronic stress and neuroendocrine alterations, are involved in this complex connection. This comorbidity negatively impacts patients' quality of life, requiring comprehensive therapeutic approaches that involve pharmacological treatments, psychotherapeutic interventions, physical therapy, among others. Understanding the interaction between mood disorders and chronic pain is essential to improve clinical approaches and provide greater well-being to affected individuals.",

This disorder has been poorly understood, and its classification has evolved due to the complicated and ever-evolving nature of the nosology of depressive disorders. In the past, this disease was considered a depressed personality state, but it is likely better conceptualized as a disease state rather than a personality disorder (permanent, pervasive way of approaching the world). This change is reflected in the history of the diagnosis as the DSM-II originally identified it as a personality disorder. It was not until the DSM-III that dysthymic disorder was defined as a mild chronic depression lasting longer than 2 years. The origin of the word dysthymia dates back to its Greek roots, with the first use of the word referring to psychiatry occurring by CF Fleming around 1844.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although diseases similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been recognized for centuries under various rubrics, strict diagnostic criteria for conditions dominated by medically unexplained chronic fatigue were first proposed in 1988. Current diagnostic criteria were originally crafted in 1994 by an International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group as an attempt to standardize patient populations included in research studies. The International CFS Research Case Definition requires chronic fatigue of at least six‐months duration; this fatigue cannot be substantially alleviated by rest, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is associated with substantial reductions in occupational, social, and personal activities. In addition, at least four out of the following eight symptoms must occur with fatigue in a six‐month period: prolonged extraordinary postexertional fatigue, impaired memory or concentration, unrefreshing sleep, aching or stiff muscles, multijoint pain, sore throat, tender glands, and new headaches (Fukuda et al., 1994). Importantly, the research case definition precludes classification as CFS if a patient has an identifiable medical cause of being fatigued. Similarly, individuals with certain psychiatric conditions cannot be classified as CFS in research studies. Exclusionary psychiatric conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and melancholic major depression. Notably, comorbidity with psychiatric disorders is relatively high. Recent data indicate that almost 60% of CFS cases in the population suffer from at least one comorbid psychiatric condition, with affective disorders being the most prevalent ones.",

      "title": "What Acute Stress Protocols Can Tell Us About PTSD and Stress-Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the fifth most prevalent mental disorder in the US, is a chronic, debilitating mental illness with as yet limited options for treatment. Hallmark symptoms of PTSD include intrusive memory of trauma, avoidance of reminders of the event, hyperarousal and hypervigilance, emotional numbing and anhedonia. PTSD is often triggered by exposure to a single traumatic experience, such as a traffic accident, a natural catastrophe, or an episode of violence. This suggests that stressful events have a primary role in the pathogenesis of the disorder, although genetic background and previous life events are likely involved. However, pathophysiology of this mental disorder, as for major depression and anxiety disorders, is still poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown how can a single traumatic, stressful event induce a disease that can last for years or decades. A major shift in the conceptual framework investigating neuropsychiatric disorders has occurred in recent years, from a monoamine-oriented hypothesis (which dominated pharmacological research for over half a century) to a neuroplasticity hypothesis, which posits that structural and functional changes in brain circuitry (largely in the glutamate system) mediate psychopathology and also therapeutic action. Rodent stress models are very useful to understand pathophysiology of PTSD. Recent studies with acute or subacute stress models have shown that exposure to short-time stressors (from several minutes to a few hours) can induce not only rapid, but also sustained changes in synaptic function (glutamate release, synaptic transmission/plasticity), neuroarchitecture (dendritic morphology, synaptic spines) and behavior (cognitive functions). Some of these changes, e.g., stress-induced increased glutamate release and dendrite retraction, are likely connected and occur more rapidly than previously thought. We propose here to use a modified version of a simple and validated protocol of footshock stress to explore different trajectories in the individual response to acute stress. This new conceptual framework may enable us to identify determinants of resilient versus vulnerable response as well as new targets for treatment, in particular for rapid-acting antidepressants. It will be interesting to investigate the putative prophylactic action of ketamine towards the maladaptive effects of acute stress in this new protocol.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During maternal separation, some primate and nonprimate species show a biphasic (active/passive) response. The second stage is characterized by reduced activity, a hunched body posture, and other behaviors. Traditionally, the second stage has been referred to as “despair” and is considered an animal model for human depression. Recent research in psychoneuroimmunology suggests an alternative hypothesis—that behaviors occurring during the second passive phase represent stress‐induced “sickness behaviors.” This perspective more readily accounts for findings in widely divergent species, does not require assumptions regarding the ability to express complex emotional states, is empirically testable, and aligns the separation model with recent hypotheses regarding the nature and ontogeny of depressive illness. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

      "abstract": "The article deals with the problem of psychological health of the individual during the war. It is stated that the emergence of the concept of “psychological health” is based on the study of health. It is noted that mental and psychological health are not identical. Psychological health is a relatively new but more significant concept than mental health. As defined by the Mental Health Organization, mental health is a state of well-being in which everyone can realize their own potential and cope with life stressors, work productively and fruitfully. It is noted that psychological health is a complex, multi-level formation representing a harmonious bodily, mental and spiritual state of an individual, which is based on a balance between internal processes, between a person and the world. There are three levels of psychological health: 1) creative level; 2) adaptive level; 3) maladaptive level or assimilative-adaptive level. There are mental and psychological trauma. In case of mental trauma, there are noticeable disorders of the normal functioning of the psyche. In the case of psychological trauma, there are no such disorders, but the basic beliefs and values of a person change significantly. Psychological trauma is associated with a traumatic event and a traumatic situation. It is determined that a traumatic situation is a certain event, an incident accompanied by a powerful stressful experience, emotional stress, threatening safety and harming the physical and psychological well-being of a person. Traumatic disorders have been systematized: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder (ASD), passive trauma, reactive appetite disorder (RAD), depressed social activity disorder (DSED), adaptation disorders, other and unspecified disorders related to trauma and stress.",

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

The most common treatment for psychomotor delay in children consists in enforcing postural changes. Prolonged crying when children are changed to a new position can be a sign of a sensory processing disorder. Addressing sensory and motor aspects simultaneously may be an effective approach. Case report. A 13-month-old child with psychomotor delay was referred to our service for early intervention. On assessment, the child did not turn into any decubitus and was not able to move or crawl on its own. He was able to take small steps when held, but tiptoeing. He was able to uphold a sitting position and play, and he had a mature pincer grip. He had some primitive or tonic reflexes, such as the positive support, tonic labyrinthine, and symmetrical tonic cervical reflexes. Comments. After two months of treatment, the child did not longer cry when he was led into postural changes. He was able to move sequentially from a sitting position into an oblique sitting position, and then into a hands-and-knees crawling position. Family participation was essential in this process.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have indicated the pernicious nature of dysthymia; its low‐grade chronicity probably contributes most to the problem of undertreatment and misdiagnosis. A high prevalence of morbidity and comorbidity is associated with dysthymia: major depression, alcoholism, anxiety and personality disorders are present in the vast majority of sufferers. It is also very unusual for people with dysthymia to not develop superimposed episodes of major depressive disorder, resulting in a longer time to recover and high rates of recurrence and chronicity. Approximately 3.1% of the population have dysthymia including children and adolescents who, like adults, exhibit a higher risk for new episodes of depressive illness if they have this disorder. Children and adolescents with depressive illnesses have higher rates of scholastic failure and school‐related problems. Dysthymia can affect every aspect of a person's quality of life including relationships with significant others, earning potential and, most importantly, mental and physical well‐being. Available data is not yet sufficient to differentiate dysthymia as a disease entity from the other depressive disorders such as major depression or double depression, or to conclude to what extent dysthymia should be thought of as a personality disorder. However, the DSM‐IV Mood Disorders Field Trial results help identify new criteria for the DSM‐IV Appendix. The relationship between dysthymic disorder and major depression needs more definition, especially in regard to course and severity, so that an accurate diagnosis can lead to expeditious and appropriate treatment.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of suspiciousness and interactions with anxiety during emotional and neutral word processing",
      "abstract": "Suspiciousness is usually classified as a symptom of psychosis, but it also occurs in depression and anxiety disorders. Though how suspiciousness overlaps with depression is not obvious, suspiciousness does seem to overlap with anxious apprehension and anxious arousal (e.g., verbal iterative processes and vigilance about environmental threat). However, suspiciousness also has unique characteristics (e.g., concern about harm from others and vigilance about social threat). Given that both anxiety and suspiciousness have been associated with abnormalities in emotion processing, it is unclear whether it is the unique characteristics of suspiciousness or the overlap with anxiety that drive abnormalities in emotion processing. Event-related brain potentials were obtained during an emotion-word Stroop task. Results indicated that suspiciousness interacts with anxious apprehension to modulate initial stimulus perception processes. Suspiciousness is associated with attention to all stimuli regardless of emotion content. In contrast, anxious arousal is associated with a later response to emotion stimuli only. These results suggest that suspiciousness and anxious apprehension share overlapping processes, but suspiciousness alone is associated with a hyperactive early vigilance response. Depression did not interact with suspiciousness to predict response to emotion stimuli. These findings suggest that it may be informative to assess suspiciousness in conjunction with anxiety in order to better understand how these symptoms interact and contribute to dysfunctional emotion processing.",

El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

It discusses how symptoms of depression and anxiety tend to cluster together into different categories; and how a psychological understanding has helped in the development of new treatments. Anxiety and depression are a part of everyday living. It is only when they persist and become more severe that they cause problems for people or their families. Many attempts have been made to identify different types of depression. In order to deal effectively with depression, it is important to know what psychological factors may be causing and maintaining it. Anxiety, like depression, is a normal part of everyday life for the majority of people. Generalized anxiety disorder is usually characterized by severe and disproportionate worry about life issues which persists more or less consistently for 6 or more months. Panic disorder is a more extreme form of anxiety than that found in generalized anxiety disorder.",

The development of neuroimaging methods has enabled significant advances towards elucidating the mechanisms underlying regulation of mood and emotion; however, our understanding of mood and emotion dysregulation in stress-related psychiatric disorders is still largely lacking. From the cognitive-affective neuroscience perspective, achieving deeper, more mechanistic understanding of mood disorders necessitates detailed understanding of specific components of neural systems involved in mood dysregulation and stabilization. In this review, we provide an overview of neural systems implicated in the development of a long-term negative mood state, as well as those related to emotion and emotion regulation, and discuss their proposed involvement in mood and anxiety disorders.",

Freud elucidated the dynamic relationships in an impressive way; he described all that can be called neurotic in hysteria.

No less important, however, are psychological symptoms. A holistic, bio-psycho-social-spiritual approach to quality of life near the end of life must address psychological distress of all types, including frank psychopathology, more moderate problems with living, and existential distress. Responding to mental health issues at the end of life requires (1) systematic and careful assessment, and (2) deployment of evidence-based treatments. In recent years, standardized assessment tools have been adapted or developed for use with people who have serious illness, and the same has happened with psychological treatments. Practitioners have several resources available to them. Given their practice orientation centered on meaningful engagement, occupational therapists can play an important role in responding to mental distress in patients with serious illness whose lives are becoming more circumscribed because of their medical condition or because of the mental distress itself. High-quality end-of-life care depends on scrupulous attention to the full spectrum of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that unfold as death draws near.",

      "title": "Five decades of debate on burnout",
      "abstract": "First described in the mid-1970s, \"burnout\" has elicited continued interest among occupational health specialists.1, 2 The World Health Organization3 defines burnout as a triadic syndrome that comprises: (i) feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; (ii) increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism towards one's job; and (iii) a sense of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment. This definition closely aligns with the conceptualisation of burnout in the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the most prominent measure of the entity.2, 4 Although burnout has become a popular indicator of job-related distress, persistent controversies surround the construct. As burnout reaches its half-century of existence, this article offers an overview of key research developments that have prompted investigators to revamp their views of the syndrome. The conventional wisdom among researchers is that burnout arises from unresolvable job stress.2, 5 The \"job-relatedness\" of burnout has been considered a signature feature of the syndrome.2 These views have been incorporated by the World Health Organization, which characterises burnout as a syndrome \"resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed\".3 Although widely shared, the idea that work-related stress is the force driving the development of burnout has proven difficult to support. Substantial associations between work-related stress and burnout have been documented in a wealth of cross-sectional studies. However, longitudinal studies have showed a more subtle pattern of results. In a meta-analysis of 74 follow-up studies, Lesener and colleagues found that job demands and job resources predicted burnout only modestly.6 Similar results were obtained by Guthier and colleagues in a meta-analysis of 48 follow-up studies focusing on job stressors and burnout.7 Guthier and colleagues found that the association between job stressors and burnout was not only small but also likely overestimated.7 In both meta-analyses, burnout was predictive of, rather than predicted by, work-related stress. In summary, there is no clear evidence that burnout is primarily caused by work, or that work contributes more to burnout than it does to other stress-related conditions — such as anxiety and depression. Recently, an increased focus on non-work factors (eg, negative life events, lifestyle factors), personality traits (eg, neuroticism), and physical disorders (eg, sleep–wake disorders and thyroid disorders) has been encouraged.7, 8 Studies capitalising on intensive longitudinal methods, objective (health) measures, and long term follow-ups may be helpful in this endeavour. Without a deeper understanding of the determinants of burnout, designing effective interventions is likely to remain challenging. Claims of an ongoing burnout epidemic have proliferated in recent decades. Sky-high prevalence estimates have been circulating in both the scientific and general press. Yet, the validity and plausibility of these figures have been a cause for concern. Investigators have underscored that burnout prevalence cannot be estimated because burnout cannot be accurately diagnosed.8, 9 In practice, burnout prevalence has been gauged using criteria that are not only clinically and theoretically arbitrary but also loose and heterogeneous.9 The use of such criteria has faced severe criticism, with calls to stop conducting (and publishing) prevalence studies until sound diagnostic criteria are established.8, 9 If developing diagnostic criteria for burnout, researchers should be mindful of diagnosis creep10 to avoid pathologising ordinary variations in stress, fatigue or motivation. Although many researchers have approached burnout and depression as two different animals,2 identifying tangible differences between the entities has been challenging.8 Examining the clinical picture ascribed to burnout, it is difficult not to notice that the symptomatology of burnout borrows heavily from that of depressive conditions. Maslach and colleagues2 themselves indicated that burnout is characterised by \"a predominance of dysphoric symptoms\". A particularly puzzling finding is that burnout symptoms correlate less strongly with each other than with depressive symptoms.8 Based on such results, investigators have suggested that burnout symptoms could be regarded as fragments of depressive symptomatology rather than the components of a standalone syndrome.11 Aetiologically, unresolvable stress appears as a common denominator.8, 12 Sen noted that burnout and depression are predicted by essentially the same factors.13 Studies of cognitive functioning, focusing on how people handle tasks and process stimuli in their environment, found that burnout involves alterations typical of depression.8 On the neurobiological front, research on burnout has been inconclusive.14 For instance, multiple cortisolic profiles have been found from study to study, from hypocortisolism to normal cortisolemia to hypercortisolism. On the therapeutic side, many clinicians have warned against drawing a demarcation line between burnout and depression. Depressive disorders require close medical attention and are a prime risk factor for suicidal behaviors.8 Separating burnout from depression may deprive people categorised as \"burned out\" of access to potentially life-saving treatments. Promoting the burnout–depression distinction without compelling evidence that a distinction is warranted may have sombre consequences. Investigators seeking to contextualise depressive symptoms within the work domain can rely on instruments such as the Occupational Depression Inventory.8, 11 Perhaps because it did not emerge from psychiatry research, burnout has often been viewed as a benign label permitting safer communication on job-related distress.15 Recent research has challenged this belief. For example, Sterkens and colleagues found that individuals with a history of burnout were less likely to be promoted.16 Interestingly, having a history of burnout mattered more when being considered for a promotion than current performance. Formerly burned-out employees were perceived more negatively in multiple domains — for example, leadership capacities, motivation, autonomy, stress tolerance, current health, chances of future sick leave, and chances of finding another job. In a randomised online trial study, Smith and colleagues found that the burnout label was as stigmatising as the depression label.17 The authors underlined that \"providing a burnout diagnosis to explain mild depressive symptoms in workplace/occupational contexts may not be more favourable in terms of alleviating stigma and increasing help-seeking\". In conclusion, the burnout label may not be as socially accepted as previously thought and may require cautious use in organisations. For decades, researchers have regarded exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy as the defining features and building blocks of the burnout syndrome.2-4 As an illustration, Maslach and Leiter5 indicated that \"[t]he burnout syndrome occurs when people experience combined crises on all three of these dimensions\". Given its pivotal status, the burnout definition could be expected to rest on a solid foundation. Historical analysis reveals a more complicated picture.18-21 The development of the burnout construct did not originate from robust empirical investigations or in-depth theorising. Burnout surfaced in the literature through anecdotal reports and rudimentary studies in which the construct appeared largely predefined.18 These studies barely met any scientific standard (eg, in terms of measurement, data analysis or replicability) and were highly susceptible to observer bias (eg, confirmation bias).2, 18-21 Such studies were thus ill-equipped to identify a syndrome. The Maslach Burnout Inventory, whose publication in 1981 formalised burnout's three-component definition, was derived from this slippery research path.2 Interestingly, there is little evidence that exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy can be subsumed under a general or higher-order burnout factor.22 Put differently, exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy do not show the unity expected of the components of a syndrome. In such a context, it is unsurprising that the characterisation of burnout remains widely debated. The controversies surrounding the burnout construct have led some researchers to engage in redefinition initiatives. To our knowledge, the most recent redefinition attempt was undertaken by Tavella and colleagues.23 These authors asked individuals \"who self-identified as experiencing burnout\" to complete a questionnaire covering multiple candidate burnout symptoms. The authors then used the symptoms reported to reshape the burnout construct. Although commendable in its clarifying intent, this redefinition attempt exhibits major limitations. Perhaps the most serious flaw is the reliance on participants self-identifying as burned out. According to Maslach and Leiter, the method of asking people whether they feel burned out is \"the worst\" because it mistakenly assumes that everybody has the same definition of burnout.24 The modus operandi used by Tavella and colleagues23 contravenes a basic survey requirement, namely, the use of univocal terms.25 The term \"burnout\" is employed in everyday conversations with various meanings to describe various experiences. Assuming that non-specialists have a common understanding of the term when even researchers and practitioners disagree on its definition is a nonstarter. The tendency to fetishise words — forgetting that words have no inherent meaning — constitutes an epistemological fallacy frequently encountered in burnout research. Fifty years of research on burnout have allowed investigators to refine their views of the syndrome (Box). Many of the narratives that accompanied the introduction of the burnout construct have been debunked. Some misconceptions have reached the status of urban legends, continuing to haunt the field despite their lack of validity. Somewhat disconcertingly, the most pressing issue for burnout researchers may be to agree on the basic nature of their entity of interest. The question of whether burnout reflects a \"genuine phenomenon\", irreducible to classical manifestations of distress (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms) may require special attention as researchers further elucidate the burnout enigma.

      "title": "Delayed onset and resolution of pain: Some observations and implications",
      "abstract": "Occasionally, pain after disease or trauma develops only after a prolonged interval. Examples include late-onset pains which first occur months or years following a stroke, spinal cord lesion or amputation of a limb; a previously experienced pain that is recalled years later; and latent pain triggered for the first time by a further insult in the same area. Late-onset pains may develop gradually or suddenly, and may be brief or long standing. Pains which develop after an innocuous insult may be associated with slowly evolving sensory changes. However, even long-standing pains, particularly those of nociceptive origin, may resolve sometimes after many years. Resolution, which again can occur gradually or suddenly, may be spontaneous or follow development of another disorder or after therapeutic intervention. The duration of this pain relief can range from minutes to an indefinite period. These clinical phenomena, and the mechanisms, including genetic factors, subserving them, have been little studied. It is postulated that mechanisms implicated in acute pain may not be the same as those that subserve pain that develops after a long interval. Those late-onset pains which develop slowly after innocuous lesions may be associated with a variety of slow anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes. In late-onset pains that follow a painful insult, however, memory of the former pain and threshold triggering factors may be particularly important. Further studies of these neglected conditions may lead to understanding of as yet unknown processes subserving pain and to novel approaches to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Trauma-related disorders in younger people have gained extensive attention in research and clinical work. However, little knowledge exists about long-term consequences of traumatic experiences (TE) across the lifespan. TEs are associated with negative outcomes for mental and physical health. Processing of TEs may take different developmental paths. Symptoms may dissipate over time, become chronic, or be reactivated in association with physical aging and age-specific stressors (e.g. retirement). Collective, or generation-specific TEs may be related to unique reactions in old age. There are no longitudinal epidemiological studies on posttraumatic stress symptomatology in the German population. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn about incidence or course of PTSD in the older adult German population. Nevertheless, research shows higher prevalence in trauma-related disorders in this group compared to younger adults, thus underlining the long-term impact of TEs in late life. Implications for therapeutic interventions for elderly patients with trauma-related disorders will be discussed.",

      "title": "Gradations of stress as determinants of the clinical picture immediately after traumatic events.",
      "abstract": "The traumatic process contains three possible stages: a stage of warning, a stage of impact (immediate reaction), and a post-traumatic stage. While identification of factors that can influence the long term clinical picture (the post-traumatic stage) has been attempted elsewhere, examination has not previously been done to explore the relationship between the severity of stressors and the immediate stress reaction. This paper proposes that gradations of stress (intensity, duration) play a key role at the stage of impact (immediate reaction), which subsequently affects both the short and long-term clinical picture. It also proposes that behavior under threat (reaction to stress) is usually an adaptive behavior, a communication, a part of a dialogue between the survivor and the surrounding environment. In this study, immediate stress reaction was measured in terms of CSR, or combat stress reactions. CSR is defined as a means by which soldiers communicate to the system that they cannot take it any more. CSR symptoms can present clinically in a variety of ways, as psychiatric reactions, accidents, somatic illnesses, behavioral acting out or conduct disorders. Reanalysis of a longitudinal study of 4000 soldiers in World War II was conducted, and the question what kind of objective stress precedes each type of CSR was asked. RESULTS indicated that gradations of stress at the stage of impact significantly influenced the clinical picture. Intensive combat typically produced psychiatric casualties and accidents. Moderate Stress tended to result in medical casualties; and prolonged, intermittent combat preceded AWOL and disciplinary manpower drain. A study in Israel, which I conducted after the 1982 war, showed similar results. Language: en",

The consequences of stress-related anxiety can be found in most of the body systems: cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal ailments, problems with the reproductive system, dermatologic disorders, and autoimmune disturbances--all have been shown to be greatly influenced by anxiety. In addition, studies of hostages and prisoners of war indicate that a person's reactions to extreme stress are predictive of his or her future physical and mental health. Thus, extreme stress-related anxiety must be identified and treated early to protect the patient from a lifetime of chronic illness.",

From the first to the second postshift day, the behavioral response has been attenuated. From the physiological evaluation carried out, the response recorded tends to remain over the days. That physiological response is maintained on the second postshift day, 300 minutes after the devaluation of the enhancer. Frustration involves processes such as memory, learning and anxiety. The reduction of frustration in post-shift 1 and 2 through a single administration of Sig1R agonist drugs supports this hypothesis.

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "abstract": "The current epidemic is a difficult social situation requiring adaptation. New, chronic stressors likely to destabilise the functioning of an individual occur. Chronic stress has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. Furthermore, it may destabilise the immune system, causing symptoms typical of inflammation – similar symptoms are observed in depressive patients. The COVID-19 pandemic is a powerful psychosocial stressor, and the restrictions imposed by governments of many countries further increase the level of social stress. It seems that the main pandemic-related stressors include fear of contracting the virus (including the family and friends) as well as anxiety about destabilised financial situation and socioeconomic uncertainty. Mood disorders, anxiety and sleeping problems, which are common symptoms of chronic stress, may not only be part of adaptive disorders, but also an inherent component of depressive or anxiety disorders. A number of studies confirming that stress during the epidemic significantly affects the functioning of many individuals, with sleeping disorders, generalised anxiety disorders and depression being the most common epidemic-related disorders, have emerged. It is therefore extremely important to identify individuals who belong to the group at highest risk of pathological symptoms induced by stress. The care for one’s own mental health, i.e. proper sleep hygiene, physical activity, diet and rest may play an important positive role in minimising the effects of stress on mental and somatic health of an individual.",

Estos pacientes suelen recibir un diagnóstico clínico de “trastorno de la personalidad”, pero probablemente sea más apropiado describirlos como pacientes “multiproblemáticos” debido a los déficits ampliamente extendidos en su funcionamiento cognitivo, emocional, conductual y social. Estos pacientes suelen experimentar estados emocionales negativos crónicos, como depresión, ansiedad, apatía, aburrimiento, soledad, culpa e ira. Este afectividad alterada es el principal impulsor de una plétora de respuestas de afrontamiento desadaptativas: las principales son la conducta suicida repetitiva y las conductas adictivas como el abuso de alcohol/drogas, los trastornos alimentarios y/o la automutilación crónica. Los pacientes multiproblemáticos también experimentan importantes déficits en el funcionamiento social e interpersonal. Tienen problemas para formar y mantener relaciones interpersonales y a menudo introducen en el proceso terapéutico un conjunto de cuestiones conflictivas en torno a la formación y el mantenimiento de relaciones adultas, tanto superficiales como íntimas. La cantidad y la magnitud de estos problemas conductuales, cognitivos y emocionales son una fuente de frustración para los terapeutas...",

Among those disorders significant numbers involve neurotic and somatoform disorders, reactive depressions, disorders of adaptation, and acute, prolonged, or delayed reactions to stress. Adverse environmental conditions and the vulnerability of individual personalities are considered to play a leading role in the genesis of these disorders. The range of psychogenic factors that give rise to borderline disorders is relatively broad; they include negative macrosocial processes, changes in way of life, extreme situations in war and peacetime, interpersonal conflicts, difficult family situations, personal failures, misfortunes, losses, etc. The development of pathological symptoms is accompanied by maladjustment, disruptions in the patient's social interactions and functioning in the community, family, everyday life, and on the job, and a decrease in the value and quality of life all of which frequently lead to various behavioral deviations: suicidal behavior, aggressive and criminal acts, and/or alcoholism and drug addiction [1, 4, 5].

There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders.

      "title": "Investigation des fonctions mnésiques impliquées dans le processus de rémission de l'état de stress post-traumatique",
      "abstract": "L'etude de l'etat de stress post-traumatique (ESPT) amene a se poser deux types de questions fondamentales : 1) pourquoi certains individus exposes a un evenement traumatique developpent le trouble alors que d'autres non? et 2) parmi ceux qui developpent le trouble, pourquoi la majorite des individus entrent en remission apres quelques mois alors que d'autres developpent un ESPT chronique qui persiste pendant plusieurs mois, voire plusieurs annees? La presente these avait donc pour but de trouver certaines explications a cette deuxieme question qui semble plus importante d'un point de vue clinique en raison des repercussions que ce trouble peut avoir sur le fonctionnement quotidien des victimes et de leur entourage. Effectivement, pour certaines victimes, plus le temps passe, plus les symptomes s'installent et se cristallisent. Pour ces individus, les symptomes chroniques et dommageables seraient souvent jumeles a differentes complications, notamment un trouble depressif ou anxieux, un trouble de dependance ou d'abus de substances, un changement au niveau de la personnalite, ainsi qu'a une degradation durable au plan du fonctionnement social et professionnel (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). Il a ete propose que le processus de remission ne requiert pas un oubli, mais reflete plutot un nouvel apprentissage (Foa, 2000) et que les dysfonctions mnesiques (souvenirs recurrents et involontaires du trauma et difficultes a se souvenirs du trauma) observees chez les victimes d'evenements traumatiques pourraient interferer avec la remission du trauma, un processus d'adaptation qui requiert ce nouvel apprentissage par extinction (Shalev, 2000). La these se compose de quatre chapitres. Le premier consiste en une description des modeles theoriques et neuronaux ainsi qu'une recension de la litterature sur les processus mnesiques impliques dans l'ESPT ainsi que les facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux dysfonctions mnesiques retrouvees dans l'ESPT. Cette recension met en evidence la controverse dans la litterature en ce qui a trait a la memoire traumatique ainsi que les principales failles methodologiques qui empechent de repondre au questionnement souleve. Le deuxieme chapitre presente une etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des experiences emotionnelles peritraumatiques (detresse et dissociation vecues au moment du trauma) chez des individus exposes a un evenement traumatique en fonction de leur statut diagnostic. Il etait anticipe qu'en appliquant la theorie d'une relation en « U » inversee entre l'intensite du stress et le systeme mnesique hippocampique (Metcalfe & Jacobs, 1998) et en tenant compte du statut diagnostique, nous pourrions mieux comprendre les resultats contradictoires obtenus jusqu'a maintenant au sujet des souvenirs traumatiques. Les resultats de cette etude ont demontre que le statut diagnostique est associe a la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des reponses peritraumatiques. Ces resultats sont donc en accord avec la theorie de Metcalfe & Jacob (1998) sur la memoire traumatique humaine qui suggere qu'un niveau de stress modere produit un souvenir forme a l'aide de l'hippocampe et est associe avec la memoire episodique, autobiographique et contextuelle, alors qu'un niveau de stress extreme mene a un encodage independant de l'hippocampe, mais associe a l'activation de l'amygdale, menant a la creation d'un souvenir decontextualise, sensoriel et charge emotionnellement. Le troisieme chapitre presente une deuxieme etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, le role des facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux fonctions mnesiques dans l'evolution des symptomes d'ESPT en etudiant l'implication de certains SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphism) du gene FKBP5 dans le processus de remission du trouble. Les resultats ont demontre que le gene FKBP5 pouvait prospectivement predire le manque d'amelioration des symptomes d'ESPT chez des individus ayant recours a une therapie pour un ESPT aigu. Des analyses plus specifiques ont aussi demontre un effet interactif des SNPs du gene FKBP5 et du souvenir subjectif de la severite du trauma (c.-a-d., les reponses peritraumatiques) sur les dysfonctions mnesiques. Les resultats demontrent donc une relation entre les corticosteroides et les performances mnesiques, ce qui pourrait interferer avec l'apprentissage par extinction, et par consequent, en partie expliquer la persistance du trouble. Le dernier chapitre propose une discussion generale des resultats qui permettent de constater que les processus mnesiques sont impliques dans la remission/persistance de l'ESPT. Les differentes forces et limites ainsi que les implications cliniques et theoriques de la presente these sont aussi examinees.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________",

GAD is a major hurdle for personal and social productivity and a financial burden on governmental health sectors; moreover, it is one of the common mental health problems in Saudi Arabia and globally with physical and psychological manifestations (e.g., muscle tension, sleeplessness, disoriented thoughts, etc.). Although, there is not a mono-factor’s direct causality of pathogenesis, there are multiple risk factors such as genetics, socioeconomic status, and life experiences that may contribute to the development of GAD. Nonetheless, the diagnosis is made using the criteria set by the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) or the international classification of diseases 11th revision (ICD-11), which covers the patient’s past medical history and present social and environmental setting. The management of GAD includes a combination of psychiatric interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) and different medications (e.g., selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors) requiring thorough investigations and deep discussions with the patient to rule out other psychiatric conditions and to reach an optimal level of healthcare, preventing further deterioration. This article addresses the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of GAD in Saudi Arabia to present an integrated and updated review.",

      "abstract": "Emergencies in psychiatry depend both on the diagnosis of the pathology (past diagnosis or that revealed by the emergency), and on the situations that caused the crisis, of which their reactional nature demands specific treatment. There is an emergency when this is felt by any of the protagonists: the patient, the doctor or the entourage. The response in the environment can be indifferent, aggravating or pacifying. The behavioural outbursts in the agitated and aggressive situations necessitate a symptomatic treatment of the agitation, investigation of the underlying somatic or psychiatric pathology, and an evaluation of the milleu often at the origin of the aggravation or agitation. New types of emergency psychiatric consultations are currently being observed, underlaid by outbursts of anxieties and anguish, and this occuring across the board. Patients with diverse pathological anxieties arrive in the emergency department with an imperative demand to be relieved. Thus psychiatirc emergency go from behavioural to more intra-psychi situations, and necessitate an evaluation and an immediate response.",

      "abstract": "The sensitive delusion of reference has been coined by Kretschmer in 1919. This delusion reaction comports three levels: the sensitive character that is defined as shy, hyperemotives and sensitives subjects that are marked by a high sense of moral values, pride, a relational hyperesthesia resulting a high vulnerability in social contacts, and a tendency to self-criticism to internalize painfully failures and susceptibility. A traumatic event that reveals the subject its own failure and who humiliates him on the plan ethics. It follows then the delusion of reference itself with: depressive remorse with hypochondriac fears and thoughts of persecution on conversations of a great banality of everyday life. It settled in adults (usually after 35 years), 'old singles', or 'young masturbators'. It is generally complicated with severe depressive episodes. Evolution is less often chronic than in the other paranoias, however, even after a favorable development, the signs are likely to reappear on the occasion of a new disappointment. The French Psychiatry school individualizes this syndrome within non-dissociative chronic delusions, among the paranoid delusions, hallucinatory chronic psychosis and paraphrenia. In DSM-IV, the sensitive delusion of reference is classified under delusional disorder category with all not dissociative chronic delusions. In the current conceptual reduction, we illustrate this fine entity by two clinical vignettes.",

      "title": "The Role of Stress in the Pathogenesis and Maintenance of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often identify psychosocial stress as a factor that exacerbates their symptoms, and many trace the onset of symptoms to a stressful period of life or a discrete traumatic incident. However, the pathophysiological relationship between stress and obsessive-compulsive disorder remains poorly characterized: it is unclear whether trauma or stress is an independent cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, a triggering factor that interacts with a preexisting diathesis, or simply a nonspecific factor that can exacerbate obsessive-compulsive disorder along with other aspects of psychiatric symptomatology. Nonetheless, preclinical research has demonstrated that stress has conspicuous effects on corticostriatal and limbic circuitry. Specifically, stress can lead to neuronal atrophy in frontal cortices (particularly the medial prefrontal cortex), the dorsomedial striatum (caudate), and the hippocampus. Stress can also result in neuronal hypertrophy in the dorsolateral striatum (putamen) and amygdala. These neurobiological effects mirror reported neural abnormalities in obsessive-compulsive disorder and may contribute to an imbalance between goal-directed and habitual behavior, an imbalance that is implicated in the pathogenesis and expression of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology. The modulation of corticostriatal and limbic circuits by stress and the resultant imbalance between habit and goal-directed learning and behavior offers a framework for investigating how stress may exacerbate or trigger obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology.",

Since the inclusion of the category of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) with the symptomatic triad of re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoidance behaviors, and hypervigilance, this entity has been a source of controversy.

      "abstract": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms represent common complications in patients with different types of dementia. Predominantly, they comprise psychosis, agitation and mood disorders, disinhibited behavior, impairment of the sleep and wakefulness rhythm, wandering, perseveration, pathological collecting, or shouting. Their appearance is related to more rapid progression of the disease, earlier institutionalization, use of physical restraints, and higher risk of mortality. Consequently, appearance of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia leads to higher costs of care provided and greater distress for caregivers. Clinical guidelines recommend nonpharmacological approaches as the first choice in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms. Pharmacological therapy should be initiated only if the symptoms were not the result of somatic causes, did not respond to nonpharmacological interventions, or were not caused by the prior medication. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines are used. This review summarizes the current findings about the efficacy and safety of the treatment of the neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementias with psychopharmaceuticals. Recommendations for treatment with antipsychotics for this indication are described in detail as this drug group is prescribed most often and, at the same time, is related to the highest risk of adverse effects and increased mortality.

It is therefore important that a consensus is reached concerning its definition in the context of psychopathology and a definition is offered. It seems important to distinguish irritable mood and its outward manifestations from violently assaultive behaviour although there may be a continuum of disturbance from mildly to severely disordered behaviour. Irritability has so far not attracted much attention from clinicians and yet it is a common mood associated with many psychiatric and non-psychiatric conditions. Severe irritability may cause considerable distress both to the patient, his associates and sometimes also those attempting to treat or otherwise help him. It may overshadow other symptoms and the correct diagnosis and management may be missed. The validity and reliability of a convenient self-assessment scale is re-examined in the light of further data. Data from previous studies in the context of mood disorders suggests that irritability is a mood state which is independent of the other major moods of depression and anxiety; the severity of irritability probably has an inverse correlation with age. The most important associated factors are listed in order to inform researchers of the possible methodological pitfalls.",

      "title": "Role of Collectivism as a Moderator between the Relationship of Organizational Role Stress and Depressive Symptoms among Executives in Private Sector Organizations",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONIn the present time, depression is one of the most important mental health problems among employees. Depression has been linked to higher organizational costs, absenteeism, and reduced work performance, productivity, increases disability, and premature early retirement. A person never becomes the victim of depression all of sudden but it progresses through different stages. It is the depressive symptoms that occur first in individuals and lead to different types of depression when these symptoms persist for certain period without any proper management which is diagnosed and classified with the help of ICD and DSM. Depressive symptoms are defined as those that do not guarantee a psychiatric diagnosis of depression, occur even more often. Depressive symptoms by themselves constitute an important mental health problem, as they are associated with increased use of health services, disability, and risk of attempted suicide (Johnson, Weissman, & Klerman, 1992). The onset of depressive symptoms can be measured through well standardized psychological scales and this may help in managing the problems of depression at early stage. There are number of individuals and organizational factors which directly or indirectly play an important role in determining the depressive symptoms. Organizational role stress and collectivistic culture are the factors that may play a pivotal role in onset of depressive symptoms of employees particularly the executives of the organizations.Organizational role stress and depressive symptomsOrganizational role stress is related to the role stress. Role stress refers to the conflict and tension due to the roles being enacted by a person at any given point of time. (Pareek, 2003). Enacted in the context of organizations, such role stresses are called organizational role stress. It may be in terms of role overload, role ambiguity, and role conflict.Role overload is defined as having too much work in too little time, role conflict involves irreconcilable demands between two or more requirements in a job, and role ambiguity indicates uncertainty that arises when individuals have inadequate information concerning their roles and it is the lack of clear and predictable work demands (Jackson & Schuler, 1985; Glazer & Beehr, 2005).Role stress also leads to psychological strain which occurs when organizational stress leads to ineffective cognitive functioning (Beehr & Glazer, 2005; Jackson & Schuler, 1985). The research model proposed by Bhagat et al (2010) depicts the three facets of organizational stress (i.e. role ambiguity, role conflict, and role overload) that are antecedents of psychological strain. Both role ambiguity and role conflict have been shown to increase emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation, while decreasing feelings of personal accomplishment (Cordes, & Dougherty, 1993; Miller, Zook & Ellis, 1989; and Lee & Ashforth, 1991). Prospective studies suggest that work stressors such as conflict are likely to increase depressive symptoms (e.g. Dormann & Zapf, 1999). The scientific results have indicated that role conflict is the most intense predictor of the emotional component of the syndrome (emotional exhaustion) (Jawahar, Stone, & Kisamore, 2007; and Mohr & Puck, 2007), role ambiguity is the most intense predictor of the cognitive component (low personal accomplishment) (Ortqvist & Wincent, 2006), whereas role overload is positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and hopelessness (Senol- Durak, Durak, & Gencoz, 2006).Collectivistic culture and depressive symptomsCollectivism is defined as being more oriented to social interdependence, cooperation, and social norms of the in-group, rather than to one's own personal preferences, thoughts, and feelings (Hui, 1988). Employees in collectivistic countries tend to perceive more coping resources (social support) available (e.g., Triandis, Bon-tempo, Villareal, Asai, & Lucca, 1988), which could account for their less negative reactions to the work demand and occupational stress. …",

      "title": "Analysis of Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Variations in Psychological Stress",
      "abstract": "Purpose: Mental stress and other psychosomatic disorders have been linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in population studies. There hasn't been a thorough examination as to whether emotional or physical stresses might cause sporadic ventricular arrhythmias in vulnerable patients. An outsized and mounting body of discovery shed light on the fact that internal health is interrelated to risk factors for heart complaint before an opinion of an internal health complaint and through treatment. These things can arise both directly, through natural pathways, and laterally, through parlous health actions. People who are passing through clinical depression, anxiety disorders, common and general stress syndromes, and indeed post-traumatic stress disorder commonly known as PTSD over an absolute period of your occasion may observe definite physiological alterations in the body, similarly, as a highly enlarged cardiac reactivity such as augmented vital signs and elevated blood pressure, deducted or condensed blood inflow directly to the center, and heightened or highly raised amount of an organic chemical compound called cortisol. Over time, these physiologic processes may generate calcium particle depositions or buildup within the normal organic pathways. It may also manifest events of body metabolic dysfunction as well as cardiac conduction problems. Substantiation shows that many physiological and psychiatric/psychological diseases -similar to chronic clinical depression, psychological stress, and PTSD can appear after any cardiac event regardless of its severity. Objective: The focal objective of this article is to identify psychological stress, its influence on cardiac problems such as cardiac arrhythmia, and its symptomatic manifestations on an electrocardiogram. Apart from that, this paper also focuses on the area of how ECG changes due to psychological distress. Another objective of this paper is to provide vivid information about psychological stress and its link with acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Laymen should know the fact that the mind and the body are linked with each other and if the mind is distressed for a long time will affect the health condition of the physical body also. Design/Methodology/Approach: To build the paper, mostly secondary information has been used from various sources such as clinical literature, journals, websites, etc. Primary information has also been used to increase the accuracy and reliability of the paper. Primary data have been taken from neuropsychologists, cardiologists, clinical psychopathologists, and behavioral medicine specialists. Based on all these databases, systematic and scientific clinical analysis of information has been done to avoid any mistakes and errors. Findings/Result: In people with ICDs, stress and physical exercise might cause ventricular rhythm abnormalities. Future studies into medicines that prevent these stimuli' responses might reduce ventricular arrhythmias and upsets in some of these patients. People with type A personalities should try to control or adjust their innate personality and character to reduce the vulnerability to develop any kind of cardiac arrhythmia or any other cardiac pathologies. All ECG variations and arrhythmias are not related to psychological stress rather it needs differential diagnosis to rule out any other underlying problems. A thorough differential investigation is suggested to rule out whether the cardiac problem is due to psychological stress or not. Originality and value: A comprehensive analysis and interpretation have been made to cover the concerned topic of study and make information more reliable and valid. A new initiative is taken to provide information about the mind and heart link. Paper Type: Secondary clinical report analysis/interpretive paper",

      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety disorders are recognized as major public health problems with substantial personal, economic and social burden on those afflicted and their families. Despite this the development of quality of life research has been rather slow in the field but it is evident both from epidemiological and clinical studies that persons with major depression have a substantially lower subjective quality of life than healthy subjects, and that quality of life is severely affected in a number of life domains as well as associated with a worse functioning in various external life conditions. Subjective quality of life has also mostly been found to be worse than in other psychiatric conditions and equal to or worse than quality of life in several major medical chronic illnesses. Although investigations of quality of life in anxiety disorder are growing they are less frequent than in depression and still in its infancy. This is most evident concerning post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and further studies in all anxiety disorders are strongly needed. The general picture emerging from studies performed is that anxiety disorders are illnesses that impair quality of life and social functioning in a number of life domains. There is some evidence that quality of life is most compromised in panic disorder (PD) and PTSD.",

      "abstract": "Whereas sighing appears to function as a physiological resetter, the psychological function of sighing is largely unknown. Sighing has been suggested to occur both during stress and negative emotions, such as panic and pain, and during positive emotions, such as relaxation and relief. In three experiments, sigh rate was investigated during short imposed states of stress and relief. Stress was induced by exposure to a loud noise stressor or by anticipation of it. Relief was induced by the end of the stressor or the anticipation that no stressor would follow. Breathing parameters were recorded continuously by means of the LifeShirt System. Results consistently showed that more sighing occurred during conditions of relief compared to conditions of stress.",

      "abstract": "The biological or medical approach views mental illness as if it were a disease or physical defect in the brain or body. Within the social approach, there are three dominant theories of mental illness etiology: stress theory, structural strain theory and labeling theory. This chapter describes each theory's basic concepts and assumptions, theoretical limitations and advantages, and implications for treating or preventing mental illness. According to stress theory, when events and strains accumulate in people's lives, they can overwhelm people's psychosocial resources and abilities to cope and then generate symptoms of psychological disorder. Labeling theory picks up at this point and suggests that frequent, severe, or highly visible symptoms or symptoms exhibited by those with little social prestige or power, can launch a victimizing process. Societal reactions to symptoms may result in the person's receiving a formal psychiatric diagnosis, becoming hospitalized, and, ultimately, accepting a mental patient identity.",

      "title": "Animal Memory and Animal Welfare",
      "abstract": "Abstract Retrieved memories of emotionally laden events are likely to influence the ongoing emotional state and behaviour of animals. If animals consciously experience memories and/or associated emotions, then recall of aversive or pleasurable events will affect their welfare. Even if they do not, retrieval of these (non-conscious/implicit) memories may result in behaviour, such as attempts to escape, that could lead to injury and damage. There is growing evidence that emotionally laden events are more readily stored in memory than neutral ones, and that the neurophysiological basis of this, involving acute elevations of the classic stress hormones and the action of the amygdala, is similar in humans and other vertebrate species. Thus, in humans and animals, emotional memories are likely to be stored as priority information and may readily be retrieved in the presence of relevant cues. If so, an important practical goal is to minimize the chances of negative emotional memories being cued inappropriately, especially for animals in captivity. Disruption of memory formation and retrieval is also important in an animal welfare context. Chronic or very high elevations of stress hormones appear to have both short- and long-term effects on brain structure and function that can interfere with efficient storage of information. Environmental disturbances, including common husbandry procedures, can also disrupt memory formation through retroactive interference effects. Elevated stress levels may both increase the chances of retrieval of negative information while hampering the retrieval of positive or neutral information. These effects may lead to poor learning abilities, selective or disrupted memory retrieval, and consequent inappropriate behaviour with adverse welfare consequences. If we understand them, we may be able to recommend housing or husbandry procedures that minimize the likelihood of their occurrence.",

      "abstract": "As emotional distress is often seen as an understandable reaction to a severe or life-threatening illness, clinicians are reluctant to make a diagnosis of depression and resort to alternative diagnoses such as adjustment disorder (AD) or demoralisation. This paper introduces these concepts and critically examines their clinical utility. It concludes that neither AD nor demoralisation can be clearly distinguished from depression on variables such as clinical symptoms, outcome or treatment response. Since AD and demoralisation are considered transient or understandable reactions, the risk of using these diagnoses as alternatives to depression in a clinical setting is that a simplistic approach of psychological therapies for the former and antidepressants for the latter will be adopted. Instead, a working diagnosis of a general distress syndrome complemented by a personalised formulation is advocated. This would lead to the generation of a problem list and a pragmatic management plan.",

Lifestyle interventions which facilitate more appropriate responses to stress are much sought after. Exercise is one such intervention and is now commonly being prescribed as a cotreatment along with drugs for treating depression. Exercised rodents display reduced anxiety and impulsivity in a variety of behavioral paradigms. Rats exposed to psychological stress show differential epigenetic and gene expression mechanisms at the dentate gyrus (DG) after long-term voluntary exercise. Alterations within ERK MAPK signalling to chromatin seem to modulate the number of epigenetically marked neurons in the DG, improving cognitive responses to a stress-related event. Other lifestyle interventions such as nutrition or better maternal care in early life have been shown to induce changes at the epigenome which impact positively on mental health.",

Exposure to emotional abuse significantly affects mental health across the lifespan and is particularly associated with elevated depression risk.This review examinesmechanisms, by which emotional abuse influences brain development and the neuroendocrine stress response system and discusses the roles of genetic vulnerability and epigenetic processes in contributing to an elevated mental health risk. Emotional abuse has similar effects on brain networks responsible for emotion processing and regulation as other maltreatment types.Moreover, it uniquely affects networks related to self-relevant information and socio-cognitive processes. Furthermore, emotional abuse is associated with an impaired recovery of the neuroendocrine response to acute stress. Similar to other maltreatment types, emotional abuse is associated with epigenetic changes in genes regulating the neuroendocrine stress response system that are implicated in increased mental health risk.These findings suggest that emotional abuse has equally detrimental effects on children'smental health as physical or sexual abuse, warranting broader societal awareness and enhanced early detection efforts. Early interventions should prioritize emotion regulation, social cognition, self-esteemenhancement, and relationship- oriented approaches for victims of emotional abuse.",

We define trauma-related disorders as borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and the dissociative disorders. Our search terms were dissociative disorders, temporal lobe, trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, psychosis, and malingering.Trauma-related psychotic-like symptoms are common and can differ in phenomenology from primary psychotic symptoms. Hallucinations consist of auditory and nonauditory content that may or may not relate to traumatic content. Child voices are highly suggestive of complex dissociative disorders. Critically, not only do these symptoms resemble those seen in temporal lobe epilepsy, but the temporal lobe is implicated in trauma-related disorders, thus providing a plausible neurobiological explanation. Despite such evidence, these symptoms are frequently considered atypical and misdiagnosed. Indeed, common structured psychological assessment tools categorize these symptoms as possible indicators of invalid testing profiles.Psychotic-like symptoms are common in trauma-related disorders, may be related to temporal lobe dysfunction, and are frequently misinterpreted. This may lead to ineffective treatment and inappropriate determinations of malingering in the forensic system.",

Recently, the term MUS has been preferred as it captures the full range of conditions characterized by persistent physical symptoms that cannot yet be explained by any medical illness or injury. In the last years, there has been an increasing interest about MUS, which represent a significant disorder among adolescents, particularly in females. At present, MUS in adolescents is a great challenge for paediatricians and primary care physicians, but since its prevalence is increasing, it will become even more relevant in the next years. Necessarily, adolescents with unexplained physical symptoms and their families seek out medical assistance, through the general paediatrician, disease specialists or the emergency department. However, medical assistance itself, if not adequate or delayed, can maintain or even worsen the symptoms in an escalating vicious circle. The result is often cyclic disability, frustration and missed opportunities to collaborate to enhance the patient functionality. On the other hand, many paediatricians have inadequate knowledge of MUS and its approach, evaluation and management. Thus, my report will focus on MUS and specifically on epidemiological and on its variable clinical presentation. I will also discuss the possible risk factors for MUS especially focusing on adolescent’s personality and emotional disorders, cognitive and learning difficulties, previous adverse life or traumatic events, family medical or psychiatric history and on the school and peer group environment. Furthermore, the optimal evaluation strategy, which requires a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach, including medical and psychosocial assessment, will be extensively discussed. Such integrate way to manage adolescents with MUS should limit the high, often disproportionate, amounts of medical interventions required, such as numerous ER visits or hospitalizations, and unnecessary investigations. Last but not least, I will outline the successful management strategy for MUS. Primarily, engagement of families and patients is crucial; psychotherapy and physiotherapy are also winning weapons, whether associated with a good alliance between patient, family and paediatrician. Frequently, the appropriate intervention should also include an early psychiatric referral. In fact, a strict collaboration between paediatricians and psychiatrists may promote prompt confirmation of the diagnosis, but also timely treatment could improve the adolescent’s quality life, preventing the social and personal negative consequences. By way of example, I will describe few cases with different clinical presenting features recently admitted to our hospital, providing the details of their diagnostic approach, the multidisciplinary management and outcome.",

      "title": "Depression, Anxiety, and Cognitive Functioning in Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) often show depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as cognitive disorders. However, it is difficult for several reasons to determine how depression and anxiety may contribute to these patients' cognitive impairments. On the one hand, other contributory factors such as fatigue may be involved; and on the other hand, the methods currently used to assess depression and anxiety are subject to bias of various kinds, which makes it difficult to determine whether and to what extent these disorders are responsible for the expression of cognitive symptoms. Lastly, little is known so far about the physiopathological mechanisms underlying these disorders. Anxiety seems to have only minor effects on MS patients' cognitive functioning. It is generally recognized that the anxiety induced by patients' difficulty in adapting to the disease and the painful emotional feelings it generates are triggered by psychosocial pressures without affecting patients' cognitive performances. Although the effects of depressive disorders on cognitive functioning are still a matter of debate, it is nevertheless possible that these disorders may influence the cognitive problems associated with MS. It is also possible that the presence of focal or diffuse brain lesions might at least partly explain the onset and the aggravation of depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments in these patients. At some particular stages in the disease (namely, the early and the progressive phase), it is particularly important to note the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and their repercussions on the patients' cognitive deficits, such as those affecting the performance of attentional and executive tasks. In view of the high prevalence of latter deficits, means of assessing and treating them are urgently required in order to be able to improve the patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a cognitive process that disrupts consciousness, identity, or memory. It is frequently used as a form of defense in response to significant stress or trauma. In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Minor psychiatric disorders, specially depression and anxiety, are highly prevalent in Latin American (LA) countries including Brazil. Some important social factors specially present in medium and large LA cities such as violence, migration and homelessness probably contribute to large number of people suffering of different forms of depressive and anxiety disorders. Latin America was colonized about 500 years ago by Spain and Portugal and their cultural identity is still very much influenced by Ibero-American attitudes and beliefs. Probably as a consequence of this situation, depression is usually expressed in LA countries more through somatic symptoms such as headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, or complaints of \"nerves\" than through subjective feelings of sadness or guilty. So, depression is much more seen in primary care services than in psychiatric clinics and as in other parts of the World is not recognized. Nevertheless, primary care patients from different cultural backgrounds with somatic complaints due to depression differ in their preferred explanations or attributions for these symptoms. Somatic complaints many times represent just a different idiom of distress related to depression; to understand their origin and role for patients from different cultures will certainly help health professionals to better identify and treat them.",

      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Depression is the most common mental illness among older adults, with substantial and persistent mood depression as the main clinical feature, which is unfavorable for improvement. The clinical manifestations can range from melancholy to grief or even numbness. Approximately one-third of older adult patients exhibit physical discomfort as the first symptom; dysgeusia as the first symptom, is very rare in clinical practice. Dysgeusia is a clinical symptom with no specific objective indicator; thus, the likelihood of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis is high. Case presentation In this study, a 60-year-old female housewife with elementary school as her highest level of education, presented to the outpatient department with dysgeusia, poor sleep, and poor mood persisting for &amp;gt;1 year, which aggravated 2 weeks before hospital visit. Psychiatric examination showed clear consciousness; the patient was cleanly and timely dressed and demonstrated self-care but had a worrisome expression. Using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (10 th edition), a diagnosis of a major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms was made. Following pharmacological and psychological treatment, the patient’s condition improved. The patient was compliant to treatment (10 mg/day of escitalopram), had a stable mood, good sleep, and no dysgeusia at &amp;gt;2 years of follow-up as an outpatient. She was able to do housework and take care of her children normally and did not complain about any other issues. Conclusion Physical discomfort is a very common complaint in older patients with depression. If persistent physical symptoms do not improve after repeated medical treatment, timely assessment of the patient’s mental state or psychiatric referral should be considered to diagnose geriatric depression. Timely pharmacological and psychological therapy are the preferred treatment for older adults.",

      "abstract": "Trauma and stressful events can disrupt the physiologic homeostasis of our bodies and brains. The physiologic stress response consists of neural and endocrine mechanisms whose function is to reestablish homeostasis. These mechanisms include the secretion of glucocorticoids (cortisol) and catecholemines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). Once an external event has ceased to be a stressor or threat to a human organism, an integrated system of negative feedback loops inhibits the continued production of these hormones and effectively shuts down the stress response. These mechanisms are adaptive in the sense that they ensure the survival of the organism by reestablishing homeostasis. But prolonged exposure to real or perceived stressors can trigger prolonged secretion of stress hormones, thereby disrupting the feedback systems and causing a cascade of pathogenic events. The stress response is a double-edged sword. An acute stress response can protect an organism from external threats and reestablish homeostasis. But a chronic stress response can cause the body's defenses to become damaging rather than protective and to result in various disorders. Acute stress responses are adaptive. Chronic stress responses are often maladaptive and pathogenic.",

Few posttraumatic neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes are more disruptive to interpersonal familial, societal, educational, and occupational functioning and activities than agitation, aggression, and violent behaviors. Agitation and irritability that occur in a patient during the acute stages of recovery from TBI not only endanger the safety of the patient and his or her caregivers but also predict increased lengths of hospital stay and impaired cognition (Bogner et al. 2001). As recovery continues, low frustration tolerance and explosive behavior may develop in response to minimal provocation or sometimes may occur without any warning at all. These behaviors may be limited to irritability or may include violent outbursts resulting in damage to property or assaults on others. In severe cases, it may be unsafe for individuals with aggressive disorders to remain in the community or with their families, and referral to long-term psychiatric or neurobehavioral facilities is sometimes required. All clinicians, and especially mental health professionals, need to be knowledgeable about and able to evaluate and treat neurologically induced agitation, irritability, aggression, and violence among their patients with TBI.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Psychological trauma is different from ordinary stressors, and has been defined as ‘experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others’ (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). These events can leave the individual with intense terror, fear and paralysing helplessness. They can also disrupt the integrity of a person, and the sense that the world is predictable and safe. In a majority of exposures there is a gradual return to daily life with no residual symptoms. If symptoms persist or start to manifest and are related to the so called ‘index trauma’, the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be made. Over time, the events qualifying for traumatic stress have been extensively debated. It must be noted that prior and cumulative effects of trauma exposure are a particularly important determinant of risk for PTSD (Burback et al., 2023).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is sometimes referred to as the “common cold” of psychopathology. There are a variety of reasons for this description. For one, the term depression is widely used to denote feelings of sadness. As with a common cold, this state of feeling depressed is experienced by everyone at one time or another. A second reason may be that forms of depression that are not clinically signifi cant, but that are more severe than simple feelings of sadness (i.e., subclinical depression), are not uncommon. A third reason probably refl ects the diversity of depression. For example, DSM–IV–TR lists 10 different types of mood disorder. Depression is common both in experience and in defi nition.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity that can affect a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings and physical well-being which lasts minimum for 2 weeks. Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

      "title": "Invited essay A cognitive model of posttraumatic stress disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common reaction to traumatic events. Many people recover in the ensuing months, but in a significant subgroup the symptoms persist, often for years. A cognitive model of persistence of PTSD is proposed. It is suggested that PTSD becomes persistent when individuals process the trauma in a way that leads to a sense of serious, current threat. The sense of threat arises as a consequence of: (1) excessively negative appraisals of the trauma and/or its sequelae and (2) a disturbance of autobiographical memory characterised by poor elaboration and contextualisation, strong associative memory and strong perceptual priming. Change in the negative appraisals and the trauma memory are prevented by a series of problematic behavioural and cognitive strategies. The model is consistent with the main clinical features of PTSD, helps explain several apparently puzzling phenomena and provides a framework for treatment by identifying three key targets for change. Recent studies have provided preliminary support for several aspects of the model. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "title": "Persistent Pain as a Disease Entity: Implications for Clinical Management",
      "abstract": "Pain has often been regarded merely as a symptom that serves as a passive warning signal of an underlying disease process. Using this model, the goal of treatment has been to identify and address the pathology causing pain in the expectation that this would lead to its resolution. However, there is accumulating evidence to indicate that persistent pain cannot be regarded as a passive symptom. Continuing nociceptive inputs result in a multitude of consequences that impact on the individual, ranging from changes in receptor function to mood dysfunction, inappropriate cognitions, and social disruption. These changes that occur as a consequence of continuing nociceptive inputs argue for the consideration of persistent pain as a disease entity in its own right. As with any disease, the extent of these changes is largely determined by the internal and external environments in which they occur. Thus genetic, psychological and social factors may all contribute to the perception and expression of persistent pain. Optimal outcomes in the management of persistent pain may be achieved not simply by attempting to remove the cause of the pain, but by addressing both the consequences and contributors that together comprise the disease of persistent pain.",

      "title": "A boy with dissociative symptoms who benefited from biopsychosocial assessment",
      "abstract": "Dissociative disorder is defined in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as “a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity and immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements,” and its prevalence in children is as low as 1.30 per 100,000 population.1 We report a case of dissociative disorder secondary to a combination of psychosocial factors in addition to the developmental characteristics of the patient, both of which have been overlooked. A 9-year-old boy suddenly lost consciousness during class one day and received a diagnosis of suspected epilepsy at another hospital. One month later, during another class, he lost consciousness again after experiencing a tremor in his hands. A close examination revealed no abnormality, and the patient was thought to have suspected psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Various short-lived involuntary movements with impaired consciousness were often observed and gradually increased in frequency, and odd behavior was observed: When the subject of school or home came up, the child would suddenly become “spaced out,” scratch his face with his hands “like an animal,” and mimic “meow” for several tens of seconds, unable to communicate with staff. The neurologist re-examined the patient for neurological diseases including encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy as differential diagnoses. However, various laboratory tests and imaging studies were negative for organic diseases. The fact that positive symptoms appeared only during stress was also suggestive of nonorganic disease. Outpatient treatment was initiated in our department but the patient was admitted to the liaison department for biopsychosocial assessment because of frequent school absences and his mother's increasing fatigue due to difficulties in raising her child at home. During his hospitalization, we conducted a psychosocial assessment by interviewing his mother about his upbringing and developmental history, observing his behavior, and conducting psychological tests. The interviews revealed his rigid thought patterns and sensory sensitivity from early childhood, and the observations of his behavior revealed a lack of nonverbal communication, so we diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. The case formulation based on the assessment results is shown in Table 1. In terms of biology, predisposing factors included cognitive bias—the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children®-Fourth Edition (WISC®-IV) at age 7 years: total IQ, 90; verbal comprehension, 119; perceptual reasoning, 76; working memory, 79; processing speed, 86—and developmental characteristics, such as obsessiveness, sensory sensitivity, and poor communication skills. As psychological factors, the initial seizures and loss of consciousness were considered to have been induced by stress with classmates, such as feelings of inferiority. Because both seizures occurred during group work, when he was being helped by group members with a task he was having difficulty with. As a social factor, there was domestic discord between parents and between siblings. The school was also unaware of the cognitive characteristics and did not take them into consideration in his daily life and learning. The stressors that he experienced therefore included changes in learning difficulty and interpersonal relationships due to his promotion to the next grade. As a therapeutic intervention, risperidone was administered as a biological treatment for the irritability in autism spectrum disorder, and psychotherapy was conducted to explain the disease to the parents and the patient, and to encourage the patient to verbalize the disease. As social treatment, we provided parents with disease education and parent training according to their son's developmental characteristics. We also shared information with the school regarding the school's understanding of the child and reasonable accommodation, including symptoms caused by the child's developmental characteristics, necessary environmental adjustments, and involvement in school situations that would encourage verbalization. After explaining the findings to the patient and his family, the dissociative symptoms gradually resolved during the 2-week hospitalization, and the patient was discharged. Fortunately, his relationship with his family has improved, and he has been transferred to a special-needs class. In this case, “personality switching,” “detachment,” “loss of sense of reality,” and “dissociative convulsions” were present as dissociative symptoms. There have been few case reports of children with dissociative disorders secondary to autism spectrum disorders.2 It is possible that the prevalence of dissociative disorders is low and that many cases, such as the present case, go undiagnosed without adequate evaluation of developmental characteristics as background. The psychosocial factors of pediatric patients with PNES are numerous and complex3 and now that biopsychosocial assessment is mandatory. “Consultation liaison psychiatry” that links psychiatry and physical medicine and provides comprehensive medical care to patients is necessary.4 Although the clinical course and symptoms of this case were atypical and difficult to diagnose, a case formulation5 from a biopsychosocial perspective in collaboration with the liaison department and the neurology department clarified each of the complex overlapping factors, leading to the planning and implementation of an effective comprehensive treatment. Further development of pediatric consultation liaison psychiatry to enhance biopsychosocial assessment would be of great benefit. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

      "title": "Central sensitization of the spino‐parabrachial‐amygdala pathway that outlasts a brief nociceptive stimulus",
      "abstract": "Key points Chronic pain is disabling because sufferers form negative associations between pain and activities, such as work, leading to the sufferer limiting these activities. Pain information arriving in the amygdala is responsible for forming these associations and contributes to us feeling bad when we are in pain. Ongoing injuries enhance the delivery of pain information to the amygdala. If we want to understand why chronic pain can continue without ongoing injury, it is important to know whether this facilitation continues once the injury has healed. In the present study, we show that a 2 min noxious heat stimulus, without ongoing injury, is able to enhance delivery of pain information to the amygdala for 3 days. If the noxious heat stimulus is repeated, this enhancement persists even longer. These changes may prime this information pathway so that subsequent injuries may feel even worse and the associative learning that results in pain‐related avoidance may be promoted. Abstract Pain is an important defence against dangers in our environment; however, some clinical conditions produce pain that outlasts this useful role and persists even after the injury has healed. The experience of pain consists of somatosensory elements of intensity and location, negative emotional/aversive feelings and subsequent restrictions on lifestyle as a result of a learned association between certain activities and pain. The amygdala contributes negative emotional value to nociceptive sensory information and forms the association between an aversive response and the environment in which it occurs. It is able to form this association because it receives nociceptive information via the spino‐parabrachio‐amygdaloid pathway and polymodal sensory information via cortical and thalamic inputs. Synaptic plasticity occurs at the parabrachial‐amygdala synapse and other brain regions in chronic pain conditions with ongoing injury; however, very little is known about how plasticity occurs in conditions with no ongoing injury. Using immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology and behavioural assays, we show that a brief nociceptive stimulus with no ongoing injury is able to produce long‐lasting synaptic plasticity at the rat parabrachial‐amygdala synapse. We show that this plasticity is caused by an increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors with a transient change in the AMPA receptor subunit, similar to long‐term potentiation. Furthermore, this synaptic potentiation primes the synapse so that a subsequent noxious stimulus causes prolonged potentiation of the nociceptive information flow into the amygdala. As a result, a second injury could have an increased negative emotional value and promote associative learning that results in pain‐related avoidance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Emotional state and personality modify our response to pain at the brain level; they do not affect peripheral pain thresholds. The most commonly studied personality traits are extrovertism and neuroticism. Extroverts are believed to complain more about their pain and may receive more analgesics in clinical situations. Patients with high neurotic-scale scores may rate their pain much higher in studies. Pain is not only associated with the idea of bodily harm but also more complex feelings of guilt, loss, and punishment that may accompany the injury. A patient’s strategy for responding to these conflicts may serve to worsen or alleviate the distress. The processes of denial, dissociation, and distraction may help to lessen the pain, whereas patients who catastrophize (characterized by negative attitudes and overly negative thoughts and ideas) will cope less well with their pain. Patients will have acquired these individual strategies from previous experience of pain and their socio-cultural development.",

Amon them premenstrual pain and fibromialgia are some of the most important clinical pictures. Chronic pain leads to depression as a consequence of these three kinds of factors: biomedical, psychosocial (passive attitude, disability) and pharmacological agents. Copping and acceptance of chronic pain is associated with lower pain intensity, less depression and less psychosocial disability. The appropriate use of analgesics in the management of chronic pain demands individualization. Several antidepressants have possitive effects on pain syndrom. Depression is underrecognized ad undertreated above all in patients with chronic pain.

      "title": "Understanding the correlates of manic episode in a woman with insular glioma",
      "abstract": "Sir, Psychiatric manifestations are common in patients with brain tumors and sometimes psychiatric symptoms are the only manifestation in these patients.[1] The common psychiatric manifestations are psychosis, mood symptoms, cognitive symptoms, changes in personality, and changes in eating or sexual behavior.[1] It is often difficult to ascertain the development of psychiatric manifestations with the course of the brain tumor. The interventions done for the treatment of brain tumor may also attribute to development of psychiatric manifestations. We highlight here a case (after obtaining informed consent) of insular glioma, who developed manic symptoms after neurosurgical and radiotherapy intervention. The management issues are also discussed. A 36-year-old female of rural background presented in the outpatient services of psychiatry with the complaints of increased irritability, increased talkativeness, grandiose talks, increased physical activity, increased religiosity and reduced sleep for the past 1 month. The symptoms would persist for most part of the day and due to which she would not be able to perform the daily chores. It was the first episode of psychiatric illness. History revealed that there was 3 episodes of generalized tonic clonic type of seizure around 1 year back. She had consulted in a neurosurgery unit and investigated for seizure. Her magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed left insular high-grade glioma. She had undergone left frontotemporal craniotomy for the same around 8 months back and tumor was removed [Figure 1]. Her postoperative period was uneventful. She was started on phenytoin 300 mg/day after surgery and also completed the course of radiotherapy over a period of 4 months. Neuropsychological assessment (on NIMHANS battery) in the post-operative period revealed mild deficits in sustained attention, delayed recall and verbal fluency. However, her recent and remote memory, visual retention and recognition and performance abilities were intact. There was no history of any other medical illness. Her family history was also uneventful. Premorbidly, she was well adjusted to life. There was no history of any psychoactive substance abuse.Figure 1: Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showing near total excision of left insular glioma (a-c). At the depth of the surgical cavity, the internal capsule is visualized (a and c) which was carefully protected during surgery. Hyperintensity around the surgical cavity may indicate small infiltrating tumor residue or postoperative gliosis (c)Her general physical examination and systemic examination did not reveal any abnormality except gum hypertrophy (adverse effect of phenytoin therapy). Her routine hemogram, liver function test, and kidney function test were within normal limits. She was diagnosed with Mania without psychotic symptoms as per the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems-10 diagnostic criteria for research diagnostic criteria. She was started sodium valproate 750 mg/day, and phenytoin was tapered off and gradually stopped. Her seizure was controlled, and manic symptoms were significantly improved over 3 weeks' time. At the end of 3 months, her symptoms were completely resolved. Among the mood symptoms associated with glioma, depressive features are more common.[2] The presence of brain lesions in an individual cannot be always to the psychiatric manifestations present in the person.[3] In our patient, there are many potential causes (tumor in the left temporal lobe, temporal lobectomy, brain tissue damage due to radiotherapy as well seizure episodes) that might have attributed to the development of psychiatric symptoms. However, none of the events temporally correlated with the onset of psychiatric manifestations. Stress response to all these major medical issues might be attributed to the psychopathology. Evidence suggest that a significant number of patients with glioma experience stress during their hospitalization and thereafter.[4] Stress can have a potential role in the development of psychiatric disorder and seems to be of relevance in our case. A mood episode independent of glioma seems to be a sound explanation in this case. Patient's manic symptoms resolved completely with sodium valproate, which is a potent antiepileptic agent as well as a mood stabilizer. Other antiepileptic agents like– phenytoin, phenobarbitone, topiramate, levetiracetam, lacosamide, zonisamide, and benzodiazepines lack the mood stabilizing the property. Choosing valproate as a medication for seizure prophylaxis, will not only ensure a seizure-free recovery; its mood stabilizing property will also take care of manic symptoms as well as aggression. The clinician needs to be cautious enough in considering the psychiatric diagnosis as well as selection of appropriate medication for its treatment. A multidisciplinary collaborative approach might be more useful in this regards. Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

Follow-up took place over 12 months.Depression occurred in 80% of patients at one or more phases of FEP; a combination of depression and suicidal thinking was present in 63%. Depression in the prodromal phase was the most significant predictor of future depression and acts of self-harm.Depression early in the emergence of a psychosis is fundamental to the development of future depression and suicidal thinking. Efforts to predict and reduce depression and deliberate self-harm in psychosis may need to target this early phase to reduce later risk.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can produce various neuropsychiatric impairments and a high susceptibility to adverse effects of psychotropic medications. A 6-year-old boy developed symptoms of ADHD after head trauma at age 30 months. Three different psychostimulants, three tricyclic antidepressants, clonidine, bupropion, fluoxetine, and propranolol were either ineffective or produced adverse effects. Side effects mainly consisted of organic mood syndrome (despite the lack of apparent genetic or organic mood disorder), sympathomimetic intoxication, and sympathomimetic hallucinosis. Buspirone (10 mg q.i.d.) produced significant improvement in impulsivity and hyperactivity, but not in attention deficits. Methamphetamine (5 mg every morning), added to the buspirone, was effective in treating the remaining attentional symptoms. These treatments were readily tolerated, and the child has remained stable for 2 years on buspirone and methamphetamine. The symptoms of mood disorder were present only during stimulant or antidepressant treatment, and therefore the diagnosis of organic mood disorder did not apply. Apart from medication side effects, the child appeared to have an \"organically-based pharmacological vulnerability to mood disorder\" and postinjury ADHD (although comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions might have contributed to the complex clinical picture). This single case study was uncontrolled, did not involve drug withdrawal design, and used clinical observations rather than standardized measures. Further study is needed before buspirone can be viewed as safe or effective for treating TBI, but buspirone may be an attractive alternative for managing certain behavioral problems following brain injury, especially in patients sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic medications.",

Two physiological systems, the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, respond to stress; collectively these systems serve to increase mental alertness and provide energy to allow an organism to respond rapidly to an emergent situation. While the response is adaptive for short‐term and infrequent stressors, modern human life presents more persistent stressors which can have a negative impact on health. Psychosocial stress has a variety of emotional, behavioral, and physiological consequences. Biological anthropologists have demonstrated that environmental changes, cultural transitions, and every day stressors result in elevated stress markers and negative health consequences across the lifespan.",

      "abstract": "В статті розглядається проблема тривожно-депресивних розладів та їх вплив на ментальне здоров’я в умовах війни. Аналіз наукової літератури показує, що тривожно-депресивні розлади в умовах війни набувають необхідність комплексного підходу до діагностики, лікування та профілактики цих станів, враховуючи як зовнішні фактори, так і індивідуальні особливості постраждалих осіб. Основна ідея проблеми тривожно- депресивних розладів та їх вплив на ментальне здоров’я в умовах війни полягає в тому, що воєнні конфлікти створюють екстремальні стресові умови, які викликають хронічний дистрес, що значно підвищує ризик розвитку тривожно-депресивних розладів, які виникають у наслідок неспроможності ефективно адаптуватися до постійних загроз, травматичних подій, та втрат, спричинених війною. Така ситуація не лише погіршує ментальне здоров’я, але й впливає на фізичний стан, соціальні зв’язки та загальну якість життя людини, вимагаючи комплексного підходу до лікування і підтримки. Війна – це екстремальна ситуація, яка виходить за рамки нормального людського досвіду. Люди, які вдалися до вимушеної внутрішньої або зовнішньої міграції, не можуть повністю дистанціюватися від подій, які стосуються їхніх родичів і місця їх постійного проживання. Зовнішні фактори, такі як військові дії, втрата житла, соціальна нестабільність, стають постійними джерелами стресу. Вони підсилюють відчуття безпорадності і безнадійності, які є детермінуючими факторами у розвитку депресивних станів. Невизначеність майбутнього та загроза життю стимулюють хронічний стрес, що у свою чергу підвищує рівень тривоги. Ми визначаємо тривожно-депресивні розлади як неврологічний стан, що характеризується поєднанням симптомів тривоги та депресії, при цьому жоден з них не є настільки вираженим, щоб окремо діагностувати тривожний розлад або депресію. У нашому дослідженні, ментальне здоров’я – це не статичне явище, а процес, що потребує систематичного догляду та уваги за всіма його компонентами: власним емоційним і психологічним станом, включаючи в себе здоровий спосіб життя, правильне харчування, регулярну фізичну активність, а також розвиток позитивних стратегій управління стресом, розвиток психічної стійкості та резилієнтності Війна впливає на всі аспекти життя людини, зокрема на психічне здоров’я, що може призвести до розвитку тривожно-депресивних розладів. Тривожно- депресивні розлади в умовах війни є серйозним психічним станом, що виникає через тривалий вплив стресових факторів, пов’язаних із бойовими діями.",

      "title": "Stressing the obvious? An allostatic look at critical illness",
      "abstract": "Stress plays a crucial role in coping with extrinsic insults through modulating the autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems. The allostatic model of maintaining \"stability through change\" allows the body to respond to a challenge by adjusting to a new steady-state and terminating it once the danger has passed. However, unrelenting stress can lead to decompensation with development of pathologic illness. With sufficient activation the response may become more damaging than the stressor itself. Two types of \"allostatic overload\" are described: type 1 is an essentially protective response triggered by changes in environment, food supply, or physiologic status where energy demand exceeds supply. The response aims to reduce this imbalance by modifying behavior and intrinsic body systems to direct the animal into a survival mode. Type 2 overload occurs when there is sufficient or excess energy consumption; however, this situation does not trigger an escape or survival response. A clear analogy may be made to critical care where excess stress affects metabolic, hormonal, and immunoinflammatory responses and contributes to the development of organ failure. Ongoing stress also compromises recovery so it is incumbent upon caregivers to reduce stress, be it induced by tissue hypoxia, catecholamine infusion, sleep deprivation, pain, anxiety, and/or excess noise.",

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

      "abstract": "Stress management is important and various stress management methods are required in the area of clinical preventive services. Although defining stress is somewhat complicated, stress can usually be divided into two concepts, stressors and the stress reaction. Stressors are stimuli that arouse the stress reaction. Examples are disasters, life events requiring changes, and everyday hassles. The stress reaction is often called the 'fight or flight reaction' and is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and various hormones, including cortisol and catecholamine. Stress is closely related with health behaviors and several chronic diseases. Stress is measured using biological tests or self report, including questionnaires and interviews. Psychosocial Wellbeing Index-Short Form, Brief Ecounter PsychoSocial Instrument-Korean version, Global Assessment of Recent Stress Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised are examples of questionnaires that are widely used in Korea. Stress coping methods are categorized into stimuli-oriented methods, cognitive-behavioral methods, and mind-body interventions. Relaxation and meditation are widely used mind-body medical interventions. Relaxation Response and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction are two of the most widely used meditative programs in the Western mainstream medical system. Abdominal breathing, Progressive Muscular Relaxation, relaxing imagery, Autogenic Training, and biofeedback are other well-known techniques for relaxation and stress management. Relaxation and meditation are effective in improving health behaviors and quality of life, and complement the treatment methods of various chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disorders and cancer. Relaxation and meditation also seem to be effective methods for use in clinical preventive services. Program development, standardization, and further study are necessary for more widespread use of mind-body interventions in the area of clinical preventive services.",

Radio-nuclear emergencies may cause psychological traumatic stress, with its potentially significant consequences in mental health, with both short and long-term effects, which extend beyond the individuals directly affected. Ionizing radiation cannot be perceived by human senses and most people are unaware of the magnitude of its effects, which could result in feelings of helplessness and vulnerability. Those situations with a high degree of uncertainty, regarding potential future health effects, are more psychologically traumatic than others. The present century has witnessed a steady increase in the number of publications concerning the mental health impact of traumatic events, showing the need of increasing the study of traumatic stress and its impact on mental health. A prompt, planned and effective response to manage disaster-induced acute traumatic stress may prevent the evolutionary reactions of traumatic stress into disorders or even chronic stress diseases that can appear after a nuclear or radiological emergency.",

Diagnostic criteria for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2000; the American Psychiatric Association had previously established very specific diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Both diagnoses require 2 months of prospective symptom ratings, which can be accomplished using forms designed by individual clinicians or employing 1 of a number of validated instruments. The patient will need to provide a complete family and personal history of mental disorders and medical diseases. A thorough physical examination and certain basic laboratory tests should either identify or rule out many potential causes of the symptoms. The diseases, disorders or situations considered in the differential diagnosis of PMS and PMDD will depend on the woman's presenting symptoms. Many women with a bothersome or debilitating premenstrual disorder go undiagnosed, either because they do not report their symptoms to a clinician or because the clinician has difficulty diagnosing the disorder.",

      "title": "Emotional and psychosocial problems after brain injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract Emotional and psychosocial disorders of brain-damaged patients have a strong impact upon the outcome of the rehabilitation. However, owing to methodological difficulties, and to the intrinsic complexity of such disorders, these issues have received only a limited amount of interest. The aim of this paper is to try to disentangle some of the major factors underlying these disturbances, making a schematic distinction between three main categories: (1) neurological factors; (2) psychological (or psychodynamic) factors; (3) psychosocial factors. Emotional disorders stem directly from neurological factors when they result from the disruption of specific neural mechanisms subserving the modulation and control of emotional and social behaviour. Patients with severe traumatic head injury are, in general, the more prototypical instances of this category, as in them the lesion usually involves some of the most important cortical components of the limbic system. According to some authors, poststroke depression should also be included in this category. Psychological or psychodynamic factors, on the other hand, consist of those personal attitudes towards the disability that result from an implicit or explicit awareness of the defect and of its implications as to the future quality of life of the patient. These factors are linked to the personality of the patient, to their life-style and to their whole system of values. Finally, psychosocial factors can be considered as the interconnected set of consequences that the handicap, resulting from the functional impairment, will produce on the patient's social activities and on their network of social relationships. An important component of this category consists of the burden that the cognitive and personality change produced by the lesion represents for the close relatives of the patient, of their reaction to this burden, and of the influence that these reactions can have on the process of recovery.",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

TSRD include disorders found in children age 6 and under (reactive attachment disorder, disinhibited social engagement disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] &amp;lt; 6) and those described for individuals who are older than age 6 (PTSD, PTSD with dissociative symptoms, acute stress disorder, adjustment reactions, and other specific TSRD, e.g., complicated grief). Treatments for children under age 6 primarily focus on caregiver–child dyads. Post-trauma symptoms such as those described for PTSD with dissociative symptoms, complicated grief, and complicated trauma require alterations in proven trauma-focused methods. In addition to appropriately timed processing of the trauma, treatments for youths are best when they are multifaceted (also include, for example, focus on support systems and relationships; self-skills, e.g., regulation, coping; and other age, symptom, and trait-related factors). For children, treatment methods often include creative methods as well (e.g., drawings, storytelling).",

Patienten im psychosomatischen oder psychiatrischen Versorgungsbereich leiden ebenfalls häufig unter komorbiden funktionellen gastrointestinalen Syndromen. Führen medikamentöse Behandlungsversuche nicht zum Erfolg oder besteht eine psychische Komorbidität, sollte eine psychosomatische oder psychotherapeutische Behandlung initiiert werden. Ebenso kann eine psychopharmakologische Behandlung hilfreich sein. Die therapeutische Interaktion wird oft als anstrengend und frustrierend erlebt.

Chronic pain has been considered a natural and unfortunate side effect which accompanied a primary illness or accident. Work injuries and motor vehicle accidents account for over 80% of the beginning nightmares for the chronic pain patient. Chronic pain has multiple causes, each of which raises the stress dimension and impacts a patient's life. However, the nonanatomic distribution of the pain and associated tenderness is one of the factors that may identify it as chronic pain. Chronic pain is accompanied by stress and distress which lead to chronic disease. In 1936 Dr. Selye discovered the general adaption syndrome in which all stress producers, such as physical, chemical, and psychological damaging agents, will provoke a reproducible nonspecific body response.",

      "title": "The origin and relief of common pain",
      "abstract": "Where pain of the musculoskeletal system is present, commonly, this pain is without objective evidence of disease, trauma, or disorder. Absence of an apparent cause for common pain prompts the consideration of mechanical stress as a contributing factor. The principal stress of the musculoskeletal s ystem is postural. By posture it is usually meant the distribution of body mass with respect to gravity. Past efforts to predict chronic pain by postural analysis or to reduce such pain by strengthening, conscious control or splinting of posture has had marginal success. Past failure to relate posture to pain is attributable to (1) ubiquity of sub-optimal posture that precludes clinical comparison to those with optimal posture; (2) presupposition that the causal relation between posture and pain is of the observational class of causality rather than the manipulable kind; (3) a definition of posture that is too narrow to complete the picture; and (4) inadequate methods for reduction of postural asymmetry to an extent that is sufficient to elicit a significant and enduring effect on sub-optimal posture and related pain. Posture can be defined more broadly as the stance of the body performing within the boundaries of posture and which is mediated by the Postural Control System towards greatest stability (Fx. 1). The stance of the body is the arrangement of the body with respect to gravity and other accelerative forces. The postural boundaries are the set of forces that resist acceleration and thereby provide the limits within which one functions stably, and this resistance is currently approximated by six principal sources of resistance to acceleration: viscous, elastic, neuromuscular, rigid, viscoelastic, and inertial. The Postural Control System is located in the brainstem and modulates body stance to more economically and stably effect and resist acceleration. The rigid boundaries can be so with respect to compressive, tractive, or tensile qualities that permits three kinds of motion: translation, rotation and oscillation. An example of postural boundaries that are rigid with respect to compression and tensile character are the bones that bear weight. In contrast, ligaments provide a tractive rigidity and musculotendons a relatively elastic boundary. Joint surfaces are considered boundaries that are rigid but not perfectly so. Of fundamental importance are those joints that are lowermost in a column of the musculoskeletal system namely: (1) the feet and ankles that support the entirety of the musculoskeletal system and; (2) the base of the sacrum that supports the vertebral spine. This broadened definition of posture leads to a greatly enhanced manipulability of posture in the upright stance and alleviation of more than two-thirds of common pain by the coherent combination of (1) manual manipulation to reduce somatic dysfunction; (2) foot orthotics to optimize the amplitude of the arches of the feet and vertically align the ankle; (3) a heel lift to level the sacral base; and (4) a group of therapeutic postures configured to minimize restriction of peripheral soft tissue reflective of the earlier posture, all aimed to optimize posture. Mediated by the postural control system, manipulation of postural boundaries accordingly modifies the structure and function of the entire musculoskeletal system. Typically, this relief is maintained by foot orthotic and heel lift alone without maintenance by manual manipulation, medication, or exercise.",

      "abstract": "The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as a severe anxiety disorder that develops after exposure to an event with actual, threatened, or perceived death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others that results in significant psychological trauma. Moreover, the ability of people to handle acute severe stress experiences varies among individuals. Depending on the underlying personality and resiliency, therefore, PTSD can occur in individuals exposed to exceedingly stressful incidences or those who have encountered seemingly less overwhelming stressors. In addition to severe stressful exposure, multiple other factors including genetic susceptibility; past experiences; cultural, spiritual, and personal beliefs; bullying and harassments; and lack of support at the workplace, social, and home environement may contribute to the development of PTSD. Author investigated multiple potential mechanisms for the development and sustenance of PTSD based on the recent literature and his own experiences and insight. Based on this search, author indicates that among other pathological and biochemical abnormalities, hormonal aberrations are most likely key mechanisms initiating and the maintenance of the PTSD. These pathophysiological neuro-hormonal changes instigate maladaptive learning processes caused by sustained high levels of anxiety and fear, through a hypo-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary axis and hyper-responsive catecholamine system (persistently elevated blood norepinephrine levels and lower than appropriate glucocorticoid levels). In addition to having inappropriately low serum cortisol levels and high epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, patients with PTSD also have mitochondrial dysfunctions and other hormonal abnormalities. Based on these data, author concluded that these pathological, biochemical and sustained neurohormonal abnormalities are likely to influence the structural brain changes, particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are characteristics of patients with PTSD. Considering these abnormalities, neuroendocrine system needs to be considered as a key target for new drug development for prevention and treatment of PTSD.

Somatform disorders are diagnosed by the presence of body symptoms that suggest a physical disorder without a demonstrable organic cause or known physiological mechanism that fully explains them and by the reasonable presumption that these symptoms are related to psychological factors or stress. Patients with chronic, serious somatoform disorders (mainly somatisation disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, and psychogenic pain) also present with personality disorders that determine the evolution or are even the main diagnosis. In addition, these patients frequently present/display severe psycho-social stress when they go to the doctor and have social adjustment problems, which often reinforce the symptoms. The gains derived from the disease and the role the patient assumes, the anomalous cognitive-perceptive mechanisms and the doctor-patient relationship are all essential for the understanding of the configuration process of many somatoform disorders and for determining their treatment. Primary care doctors therefore should be aware of and consider somatisation disorders in their clinical practice because many of the patient's symptoms could be an expression of their emotional difficulties that summarize complex psychological, life, family and social interactions, that may jeopardize the doctor-patient relationship.",

Usually, there is a primary caregiver, most often a spouse or middle-aged child, who becomes responsible for the care of the patient as the process moves slowly but inexorably to its termination. Increasing physical and mental demands accompany the changes, with physical illness and stress as potential outcomes for the caregiver. Even if the demands are handled successfully, there will be a need to consider legal and economic factors, including the eventual placement of the patient in a long-term care facility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is being increasingly recognised as a significant consequence of treatment in the critical care environment. As post-ICU syndrome is such a broad-reaching and complex problem, it is difficult to define true risk factors.

      "abstract": "There is remarkable heterogeneity in the response to bereavement in the later adult years. Resilient coping often prevails over prolonged distress and dysfunction. To understand the bereaved elder's state of mind it is useful to consider (1) the pre-bereavement situation. e.g., relationship status and the survivor's own health; (2) Experiences at the time of death; (3) early phases of bereavement that can forecast subsequent problems and the impact of status change (e.g., from wife to widow); (4) later phases in which hidden grief can intensify behavioral and somatic problems. Bereavement, with its burden of grief and self-doubt, is experienced across a broad range of situations, from the death of a treasured animal companion, to the exhaustion of a family caregiver for a person with Alzheimer disease. Grief counseling has been proving effective for elderly adults, especially as emerging generations tend to be more receptive to mental health options. Mental health professionals are challenged to recognize the increasing ethnic diversity within the ranks of elderly adults and to identify those points at which they can be most helpful with the difficult transitions that often follow the loss of a loved one.",

Yet, this illness does not arouse our sympathy or compassion as do physical illnesses with far less devastating consequences: on the contrary, mental illness often arouses impatience, if not outright intolerance and hostility.",

      "abstract": "Down syndrome disintegrative disorder (DSDD), a developmental regression in children with Down syndrome (DS), is a clinical entity that is characterized by a loss of previously acquired adaptive, cognitive, and social functioning in persons with DS usually in adolescence to early adulthood. Initially reported in 1946 as \"catatonic psychosis,\" there has been an increasing interest among the DS community, primary care, and subspecialty providers in this clinical area over the past decade. This condition has a subacute onset and can include symptoms of mood lability, decreased participation in activities of daily living, new-onset insomnia, social withdrawal, autistic-like regression, mutism, and catatonia. The acute phase is followed by a chronic phase in which baseline functioning may not return. No strict criteria or definitive testing is currently available to diagnose DSDD, although a comprehensive psychosocial and medical evaluation is warranted for individuals presenting with such symptoms. The etiology of DSDD is unknown, but in several hypotheses for regression in this population, psychological stress, primary psychiatric disease, and autoimmunity are proposed as potential causes of DSDD. Both psychiatric therapy and immunotherapies have been described as DSDD treatments, with both revealing potential benefit in limited cohorts. In this article, we review the current data regarding clinical phenotypes, differential diagnosis, neurodiagnostic workup, and potential therapeutic options for this unique, most disturbing, and infrequently reported disorder.",

With respect to the distinction between psychological and somatoform manifestations of dissociation current data suggest a hypothesis to which extent mild manifestations of 'pseudoneurological' symptoms in healthy young population may be linked to stress-related psychopathological symptoms or whether these symptoms more likely could be attributed to unexplained somatic factors. With this aim we have assessed the relationship between somatoform dissociation and stress-related psychopathology (i.e. anxiety, depression, symptoms of traumatic stress, alexithymia) in a group of 250 healthy non-psychiatric and non-clinical young adults. Results of this study show that the symptoms of somatoform dissociation are significantly linked to stress-related psychopathology. Findings of this study show that the 'pseudoneurological' symptoms may be linked to stress-related psychopathological processes which indicate that also mild levels of stress may influence somatic feelings and may lead to various somatoform dissociative symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Mixed anxiety and depression (MAD) is a new diagnostic category introduced in the ICD-10 classification for patients seen mainly in primary care settings. These patients are defined as those suffering from symptoms of anxiety and depression of limited and equal intensity accompanied by at least some autonomic features, who do not qualify for specific diagnosis of anxiety or depressive disorders and are independent of stressful life events. The validity of this clinical entity is presently under investigation in the DSM-IV-MAD field trial. Cases of mixed anxiety and depression, however, are not limited to those meeting the criteria of this new \"subsyndromal\" category. Many patients fulfilling criteria for either depressive or anxiety disorders may also respectively present symptoms, syndromes, or a diagnosis of anxiety or depression. It is still not known whether anxious and depressive symptoms are two different expressions of the same psychopathologic underlying process. Tyrer's recent description of a \"general neurotic syndrome\" is an attempt to reunify syndromes separated in our present classifications. In this comprehensive approach, anxiety, depression, or MAD states are associated at different times with specific personality features and considered as expressing different levels of overreactivity to various stressful situations. This hypothesis would explain the close relationship existing between these two categories of symptoms and the common efficacy of some psychopharmacologic agents for both anxiety and depressive disorders.",

Malingering is where symptoms are intentionally produced with the aim of securing tangible benefits. The problem is the difficulty of distinguishing malingering from factitious disorders, in which symptoms are intentionally produced but where there is no apparent external incentive and the motivation seems to be unconscious. These conditions are in turn difficult to distinguish from somatoform disorders, in which both symptoms and motivation appear to arise from unconscious processes. As Malleson observes, perhaps the essential difference depends upon the effectiveness with which the victim can “deceive himself and therefore others.”\r\n\r\nMalleson, a Canadian psychiatrist, discusses the “dissimulating disorders”—by any criterion one of the most important issues in contemporary medical practice—by focusing on the epidemic of whiplash neck injuries following minor car crashes. Through a comprehensive survey of the literature he exposes how doctors, alternative practitioners, scientists, lawyers, and patients have colluded in promoting a disorder that now afflicts millions and costs billions. While patients who sustain serious neck injuries have a good prognosis, minor collisions producing no demonstrable tissue damage now result in lifelong disability in around 10% of cases.\r\n\r\nMalleson regards whiplash as a modern combination of the 19th century conditions of “railway spine” and hysteria. He locates it as one of a family of fashionable conditions, including fibromyalgia, repetitive strain injury, chronic fatigue syndrome, occupational back pain, chronic pain syndrome, and post-traumatic stress disorder, which the medical profession has offered patients who are, either consciously or unconsciously, seeking an escape from the pressures of modern life into the roles of sickness and victimhood. As he shows in this elegantly written and profound book, these conditions risk degrading medicine and bankrupting health services; they elevate junk science and corrupt the law; worst of all, they condemn patients to disorders from which there is little hope of recovery.\r\n\r\nIn one of his many aphorisms, Malleson captures the real menace of whiplash: “In perceiving a small auto collision as a cause of a persistent and disabling psychiatric disorder we diminish the calibre of our souls. We dissipate our human heritage of courage.”",

PTSD is a complex psychiatric condition that tends to run a chronic course. Measurement of treatment outcome in PTSD is confounded by multiple factors, including a high prevalence of comorbid disorders, reactivation of the syndrome by ongoing environmental stressors, spontaneous recovery of the early disorder, and a fluctuating course of the chronic disorder. Four principal domains of treatment outcome may be evaluated in PTSD: core symptom severity, comorbid conditions (particularly depression), adverse practices (e.g., violence or alcohol consumption), and social/vocational disability. To gain an accurate assessment of these domains, a comprehensive assessment battery is needed. The relevant instruments and their yield in studies of PTSD are reviewed.",

      "title": "Unspoken trauma: How silent posttraumatic stress disorder fuels rising hypertension",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most extensively researched psychological conditions, known to present with numerous physical symptoms. Among the various dimensions of PTSD, those that manifest more overtly—such as recurring flashbacks and intrusive thoughts—are widely recognized and accepted. However, a less apparent form of the disorder, termed silent PTSD, often goes unnoticed, untreated, and unmanaged in most cases. Unlike traditional PTSD, silent PTSD lacks prominent symptoms like trauma reliving or acute panic episodes. Instead, it operates insidiously, progressively affecting the body through chronic stress and wear on multiple systems. One of the most severe outcomes associated with silent PTSD is its significant role in contributing to the development of hypertension. The relationship between silent PTSD and hypertension is complex and multifactorial, but it primarily stems from the persistent state of stress and arousal experienced by individuals. When this heightened stress persists over extended periods, it leads to chronic hyperactivation of the cardiovascular system. Over time, this hyperactivation overwhelms the body’s adaptive mechanisms, resulting in prolonged stress and, consequently, elevated blood pressure levels. If left untreated, this continuous cycle significantly increases the risk of developing hypertensive diseases. This paper explores how silent PTSD facilitates the onset of hypertension and underscores the critical need for increased awareness about this hidden form of PTSD. It highlights the importance of implementing improved screening methods, particularly in populations frequently exposed to traumatic events. By identifying and addressing silent PTSD early, healthcare professionals can mitigate its long-term health consequences, including its devastating impact on cardiovascular health. Recognizing the subtle yet pervasive effects of silent PTSD is essential to ensure timely intervention and promote better outcomes for affected individuals.",

Diagnosis of major depression in old age could also could be a challenge, due to aspects like (1) there is a higher vulnerability to the stigma of depression in this population, (2) hypochondriac ideation and somatic symptoms are the main symptoms, while depressive disposition or anhedonia are under-reported by such patients, (3) differential diagnosis includes various organic diseases, but also several psychiatric disorders, like neurocognitive disorders, organic affective disorders, drug induced affective disorders etc. Reduction of social relationships caused by retirement and loss of spouse and friends, as well as a decrease of personal income could precipitate or maintain depressive disorders during late-life. Quality of life in patients diagnosed with depressive major disorders is a rarely monitored parameter, although its importance for case management could not be overemphasized. A reduction of life quality correlates with a poorer functional prognosis, persistence of neglected residual symptoms, low adherence to treatment plan.",

      "abstract": "Summary Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric illness due to damage of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD is about 2.5% of the population. The rates in men and women are equal. The mean age of onset is in the mid-to-late twenties to early thirties, and it is slightly earlier in males´ population. OCD has two fundamental phenomenological characteristics: repetitive urges of thoughts or actions which patients experience as coming from their own mind but as alien to their will; and surges of unbearable anxiety which accompany either resistance to these compulsions or exposure to objects or thoughts which trigger the repetitive behaviour or cognitions. The cultural influence on the content of the obsessions has been noted in the epidemiological studies. The familial nature of OCD has been observed since several years and recent studies have provided limited evidence for the importance of genetic factors in the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Recent studies suggest gender-related clinical differences in the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most prevalent obsession is concerned with contamination by dirt and/or germs. Washing is the accompanying compulsion and such patients may spend several hours daily washing their hands or cleaning their clothes. There are two main approaches to the treatment of OCD: psychological treatment and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants afford a successful treatments for OCD but only those with potent effects on the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems appear to have antiobsessional efficacy.",

While some of these events can be considered normal and expected occurrences of an individual moving through the life course, others can be described as a product of the historical context in which the individual resides. The combination of these stressful events, whether in the form of major role transitions, the development of chronic conditions, or the perpetuation of daily hassles, can have significant consequences on the health of aging individuals, and these consequences can be mediated by a host of other factors such as individual control of events, coping strategies, and social support.",

Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

      "title": "Pain in Animals and Humans: An Introduction",
      "abstract": "No issue in animal research is more sensitive than that of inducing distress in animals. Both the Animal Welfare Act and Health Research Extension Act (1985) require special justification and committee approval before research likely to produce distress in animals is performed. It is therefore imperative that investigators carefully review all aspects of their proposed investigations, with the intention of reducing or eliminating factors that may lead to distress. A variety of factors contribute to distress in the research setting. These factors are commonly termed stressors and are known to elicit typical physiological and/or biochemical responses, for example, stimulation of the adrenocortical axis. While exposure to some stressful events is necessary for normal development, it is the abnormal response to these events, distress, that should be avoided. Whether or not an animal responds to a stressor by manifesting signs of distress depends on the duration and intensity of the stressor as well as the animal's previous experience. One signal of distress, sometimes the only sign, is maladaptive behavior. As a result, special attention must be given to species typical behaviors and abnormalities in these behaviors when attempting to assess the presence or absence of distress. One well recognized stressor is pain. While many scientific investigations can adequately avoid pain, a few types of experiments, especially those involved with testing analgesics, may induce pain. It is particularly important in these studies that the methods chosen appropriately simulate the condition under study in man, that the intensity and duration of the stimulus be the minimum necessary to generate scientifically valid results, and that special attention be given throughout the study to assess the presence of distress in the animal. Animals involved in studies that may lead to severe or chronic pain that is not expected to be relieved by analgesics should be euthanized during or at the conclusion of the procedure. With this in mind, we have invited a number of investigators to submit manuscripts dealing with pain and its assessment and alleviation in humans and nonhuman animals.

      "title": "Management of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 35-year-old married woman with an obsessive compulsive disorder. She had a 21-year history of obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors including compulsive checking which had become persistent since the birth of her first child. There is no evidence of comorbidity, except for a mild generalized anxiety disorder. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common chronic, and disabling disorder characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive and distressing thoughts, images, or impulses. Compulsions are repetitive, intentional behaviors that the person feels compelled to perform, often with a desire to resist. Compulsions are typically intended to avert some fear event or to reduce distress. These symptoms are ego-dystonic and cause significant distress to patients and their families. OCD is among the most common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2.3% [1]. It is almost equally distributed between males and females.OCD often begins in adolescence or early adulthood usually with a gradual onset. However, a rapid onset of symptoms may occur, sometimes associated with a traumatic event, such as pregnancy or loss. Actually, recent literature suggests that pregnancy may precipitate OCD in individuals [2, 3], as in our case report. It appears that patients who reported the onset or worsening of OCD symptoms in pregnancy developed fear of harming the fetus or child [3, 4]. However, in our case report, the patient's preoccupations deal with responsibility for her child's health (e.g. 'my son will choke to death with his blanket if I don't check'): the patient does not fear being responsible for any harm coming to her son. Due to the secretive nature of the disorder, there is often a delay of more than 10 years before patients come to specialty settings [5]. The trouble is usually long, with most patients experiencing a chronic course, while others experience a fluctuating one [6].Patients with both obsessions and compulsions constitute a large proportion of affected patients. OCD can be expressed through many different symptoms. The classical presentation includes obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors of washing and/or checking. Another pattern is one with merely intrusive obsessional thoughts, without compulsion (table 1).OCD can be severely incapacitating: depression is the most common complication and the symptoms can spread to interfere with the patient's social and occupational functioning, often involving the entire family.The case report thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or psychiatric unit. The patient meets the criteria for OCD according the DSM-IV [7].Until the early 1970s, OCD was considered a treatment refractory, chronic situation. Neither psychodynamic therapy nor a variety of pharmacological treatments, available at that time, led to significant improvement. Today, substantial evidence suggests that behavior therapy is effective in treating this chronic disorder [8]. Furthermore, recent advances in pharmacotherapy have led to a significant reduction in suffering and a return to productive living for many patients with OCD [9]. OCD is currently treated with pharmacological and/or psychological approaches. Our patient refused any pharmacological treatment; thus we recommended psychotherapy (20 sessions).Among the best established treatments are behavioral therapy, particularly those involving exposure and response prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) involves the combination of behavior therapy (BT; exposure with response prevention, ERP) and cognitive therapy (CT). After more than a quarter century of research, ERP has become the gold standard to which other psychological treatments for OCD, such as CT, have been compared [10]. For CBT15–20 sessions are proposed for the treatment of an uncomplicated OCD patient. The format is individual weekly therapy sessions. A maintenance schedule is required (monthly booster sessions for 6–12 months).BT for OCD most specifically involves exposure and response or ritual prevention. The effectiveness of BT, in the form of ERP for OCD, has been demonstrated in controlled studies and meta-analyses [11, 12]. To date, the last meta-analysis [12]including 77 studies with 4,651 patients showed that BT was superior to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Exposure capitalizes on the fact that anxiety usually attenuates after a sufficient duration of contact with a feared stimulus. In order to achieve adequate exposure, it is usually necessary to help the patient block the rituals or avoidance behaviors, a process termed response or ritual prevention. In fact, the OCD patient is exposed to stimuli that provoke the obsessive response and helped to desist from avoidance and escape (compulsive) behavior. The rationale for treatment has to be outlined in the detail during the initial session for the patient and significant others, if present. This rationale uses a functional analysis to describe the patient's symptoms and to explain how the reduction of anxiety through compulsions maintains the behavior. It includes the theoretical and practical implications of ERP, focusing on the reduction of anxiety and rituals, and explains imaginary and in vivo exposure. Information gathering includes current OCD symptoms and general functioning, administration of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, course and history of OCD, previous treatment and response, general psychosocial and family history. Information gathering usually requires three sessions. Treatment planning has to be completed in the session preceding the first exposure session, focusing on the construction of a hierarchy (which includes items that the patient either currently avoids or performs only with rituals). The patient is asked to rate each item on a rating scale in which 0 indicates no anxiety and 100 indicates maximum anxiety. After the situations are ranked from lowest to highest anxiety rating, exposure therapy proceeds upward on the hierarchy, beginning with the lower-rated items to maximize compliance of the patient. The techniques which have to be used are therapist-aided ERP in imagination and/or in vivo, exposure in vivo with response prevention through homework and family intervention whenever the family is involved in rituals [13, 14]. The patients have to record homework completion. Behavioral homework is discussed and set with the therapist.To date less attention has been paid to CT, which may be added to ERP, to address such things as faulty estimation of danger or the exaggerated sense of personal responsibility often seen in OCD patients. The first step in CT for OCD consists of informing the patient that his/her intrusive thoughts are an abnormal phenomenon and provides him or her with a list of intrusive thoughts that commonly occur in the general population [15]. The patient learns that the difference between normal and dysfunctional intrusive thoughts lies in the significance attached to these thoughts. The interpretation of these intrusive thoughts made by people with obsession affects the occurrence and/or the content of these thoughts [16]. An important general cognitive technique used by the therapist to challenge the automatic thoughts is Socratic Dialogue [17]. The patient is encouraged to question the catastrophic significance of the intrusive thought and to construct alternative less catastrophic interpretations. Behavioral experiments are also commonly used to test the empirical basis of the patient's new interpretation in order to challenge or evaluate the beliefs. Two controlled trials compared CT based on Beck's model and ERP. Van Oppen et al. [10]demonstrated that CT was better than ERP at the post-test phase, but to date no follow-up of this study has been published. In a randomized controlled trial [18]CT and intensive BT were equally effective on OCD, but at post-test CT had specific effects on depression which were stronger than those of BT. Findings for the 1-year follow-up study are presently in preparation. The principal finding is that benefits are maintained and both treatments produced equivalent results: at week 26 and 52, improvement was retained in both groups without between-group difference. Cognitive measures of obsessions changed equally in the 2 groups.In our case, the first 3 sessions were assigned to the behavioral analysis, the therapeutic goals, and evaluation. We then started the CT from session 3 to 12. We first explained the OCD cognitive model to the patient, and then we taught her to point out and modify her automatic thoughts and cognitive biases. Automatic thoughts dealt with disasters and her responsibility for these ('if I haven't closed the window, someone will enter and take my son away'). During the 13th session, we started the behavioral therapy (ERP) for 8 sessions. After having explained the OCD behavioral model and the habituation principle to the patient, we set up a hierarchy in order to expose the patient (imaginary and in vivo exposure).The predominant hypothesis about OCD pathophysiology implicates abnormal serotonergic function regulation. Research clearly shows that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only effective treatments for OCD. These medications increase the concentration of serotonin. Six SRIs are currently available: clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram are SSRIs because they primarily affect only serotonin. Clomipramine is a nonselective SRI: it affects many other neurotransmitters besides serotonin.In most cases, treatment should be initiated with a SSRI because of the superior safety tolerability, and equivalent efficacy of this class of drug compared with clomipramine [19]. Actually, there have been relatively few comparative studies between the SSRIs in the treatment of OCD [20, 21, 22]. The studies comparing SSRI and clomipramine have shown that they all demonstrated efficacy [23, 24]. However, clomipramine is also associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In a flexible dose trial of paroxetine compared with clomipramine in 406 patients with OCD [26], paroxetine and clomipramine were more effective than placebo. In terms of efficacy, no significant difference between paroxetine and clomipramine were noted beginning at week 6, and the response was nearly equivalent at week 12. However, significantly more patients treated with clomipramine withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. In a review of the efficacy of SRIs in OCD [30], the authors reported that SSRIs possess efficacy similar to that of clomipramine, but have a superior side effect profile. This suggestion may have important implications for patients with OCD who require long-term treatment. In a multicenter meta-analysis [31]placebo-controlled trials found clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline to be superior to placebo. These authors also found that the 3 SSRIs were comparable to each other in efficacy and that clomipramine was more effective than the SSRIs. Stein et al. [32]presented a meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy trials for OCD. In placebo-controlled trials, SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) had a significant effect on medication effect size with clomipramine more effective than fluoxetine. Another meta- analytic review of the efficacy of drug treatments [33]found that SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) are effective in short-term treatments for patients suffering from OCD; although the increase in improvement rate over placebo was greater for clomipramine than for SSRIs, direct comparison between these drugs showed that they had similar therapeutic efficacy on obsessive-compulsive symptoms; concomitant high levels of depression at the outset did not seem necessary for clomipramine and for SSRIs to improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In a meta-analysis comparing pharmacological treatments of OCD (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline) [34], clomipramine was not significantly better than fluoxetine or fluvoxamine; no significant difference was found between clomipramine and the other SRIs as a group in head to head trials; furthermore, no difference in drop-out rates was found. Clomipramine stands out from the other SRIs. The authors conclude that this difference is probably not clinically significant enough to warrant first choice treatment, given clomipramine's greater lethality in overdose.The backbone of pharmacological treatment for OCD is a 10- to 12- week trial with clomipramine or a SSRI in adequate doses before initiating alternative therapy. Actually, OCD appears to respond in a time interval of approximately 8–12 weeks. Clinical experience suggests the necessity of long-term, and in some case lifelong treatment. As far as pharmacologic treatment is concerned, a drug treatment should last at least 2 years after the remission of symptoms before considering medication withdrawal. This is motivated by the fact that preliminary evidence suggests that relapses after discontinuation of the drug are associated with increased resistance of treatment [35]. If the patient does not respond to an average dose of SSRI, the experts [36]recommend gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 4–8 weeks from the start of the treatment. When a patient is having a partial response to an average dose of SSRI, the experts suggest gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 5–9 weeks from the start of the treatment. They consider 8–13 weeks an adequate medication trial before changing medication or augmenting with another agent.Despite these significant advances in pharmacological treatment with SSRIs and clomipramine, as many as 40–60% of OCD patients are clinically unchanged after an adequate trial with these agents [37].Simos [38]reported that the efficacy of combined BT and pharmacotherapy for OCD is controversial. In a review of relevant studies, Steketee [39]concluded that this combination has shown little advantage over BT alone. Preliminary findings from a trial by Kozak et al. [40]also supported this conclusion. However, some controlled studies combining BT with antidepressants showed a better outcome on rituals and depression in the long term. In particular, Cottraux et al. [41]showed that SSRI + BT compared to placebo + BT gives better results at 3 months on rituals and at 6 months on depression with equivalent results at 12 and 18 months. Moreover, a more recent but small sample study comparing CBT and medication in the treatment of OCD provided evidence in favor of the combination [42]. OCD patients received 1 of 4 treatments: medication and CBT simultaneously; CBT only; medication while on a waiting list for CBT, or no treatment while on a waiting list for CBT. Multivariate analyses revealed that the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and clinical ratings significantly improved after treatment in all groups except the non-treatment, waiting list, control group. Subjects in the 2 treatment groups receiving CBT showed reduced strength in their obsessional beliefs. The subsequent administration of CBT to those groups on the waiting list also decreased the strength of their primary obsessional beliefs and beliefs about the consequences of not performing the rituals. Results of this small sample study suggest that either CBT or medication alone is more effective than no treatment. The combination seems to potentiate treatment efficacy, and, according to the authors, it is more clinically beneficial to introduce CBT after a period of medication rather than to start both therapies simultaneously. This study is limited by the small number of subjects per condition (5–9 maximum), the duration of the treatment (5 months), and the absence of follow-up.Initial management of OCD relies on potent SRIs and CBT, used separately, sequentially or concurrently. 90% of patients can be helped with one or combination of these therapies [43].Unfortunately some patients do not respond adequately or at all to the initial treatment plan of CBT or SSRI or a combination of the two. The experts [36]recommend adding an SSRI when patients have not responded well to CBT alone. When patients have not done well with medication management alone, the experts suggest either adding CBT or switching to another SSRI. Thus, combined CBT and medication is the experts' preference for most patients who have not responded to an initial trial of either CBT or medication alone. In patients who have shown no response to combined treatment, the experts recommend switching SSRIs and continuing CBT. In patients with a partial response to combination therapy, they suggest switching SSRIs, providing more CBT, and possibly augmenting with another medication.Some patients are treatment-refractory, defined by the experts [36]as those who fail to respond to 3 sequential well-delivered SRI trials combined with expert CBT. A thorough clinical assessment of patients with treatment-refractory OCD is the first step in planning possible intervention. All DSM-IV axes should be thoroughly evaluated. These aspects include assessment of complications: Axis I (e.g., comorbid disorders); Axis II (e.g., personality disorders); Axis III (e.g., underlying medical disorder), and Axis IV (e.g., psychosocial stressors). In addition, the OCD symptoms themselves should be carefully assessed. Actually, there is some evidence that hoarding is more likely than other OCD symptoms to fail to respond to treatment [44, 45].There are a growing number of management options, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy augmentation, and alternative interventions for treatment-refractory OCD patients. The literature has somewhat less agreement about what to do in managing treatment-refractory patients. First-line recommendations are to add an augmenting medication, especially if the patient exhibits associated features (e.g., tics or a comorbid anxiety disorder) that might predict a positive response to augmentation. For example, it may be helpful to add an anxiety-reducing medication, such as clonazepam or alprazolam, in patients with high levels of anxiety; a high potency neuroleptic, such as haloperidol or risperidone, when tics or comorbid schizotypy are present. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting (e.g., using a partial hospital or inpatient behavioral unit to conduct therapist-assisted ERP), technique, intensity (additional CBT sessions or intensive CBT), or format (family or group therapy), or to switch to another SRI or a monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Pharmacotherapy augmentation included augmentation with serotoningeric agents, dopaminergic agents, and various other agents as well as alternative forms (e.g., increased doses) or routes (e.g., intravenous administration) of SRI administration.There are a variety of psychological factors, such as low motivation, negative expectancies for treatment success, procrastination, and noncompliance, that may interfere with response to ERP. In these cases, the cognitive component of OCD should be addressed more directly [46]. Obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions were studied as predictors of compliance with and response to BT in a controlled trial [47]. High scores on the hoarding dimension were more likely to dropout prematurely from the study and tend to improve less. BT is specially indicated for OCD patients with aggressive/checking, contamination/cleaning and symmetry/ordering symptoms. OCD patients with comorbid personality disorder should be treated by integrative CT [48].To better understand the causes of obsessions and compulsions, further work needs to be done to identify cognitive domains (beliefs and appraisals) that are specific to OCD. Some of the beliefs and appraisals identified by the Obsessive Compulsive Working Group [49]may be nonspecific, playing a role in obsessions, compulsions, and in many other clinical problems such as depression and generalized anxiety. Further work also needs to be done to identify the causes of important beliefs and appraisals. Advances in understanding OCD are more likely to occur if we can integrate the various methods of assessment [50]. There are also several challenges to be met in the area of OC spectrum disorders. First, the boundaries of the OC spectrum need to be better defined. More systematic research is needed on the relationship between OCD and various spectrum disorders, especially with respect to etiology, treatment response, and other theoretical important features [51]. Notwithstanding the growing evidence for the efficacy of CT or CBT in treating OCD, there is still little evidence that cognitive components of treatment add to the effectiveness of behavioral therapy [18, 52]. Perhaps we do not yet know enough about cognition in OCD, especially how to measure and modify them. A number of researchers have demonstrated that CBT produces a change in measures of beliefs considered relevant and/or specific to OCD. However, these studies are preliminary at this point, but nonetheless promising [53].The development of new models of OCD should help to understand and improve actual treatments, such as the model of perceived impulsivity and compensatory compulsivity [54].The experts [36]usually prefer to begin the treatment of OCD with either CBT alone or with a combination of CBT and medication. The likelihood that medication will be included in the recommendation varies with the severity of the OCD and the age of the patient. In milder OCD, CBT alone is the initial choice. As severity increased, the experts are more likely to add medications to CBT as the initial treatment or to use medication alone. In younger patients, the experts are more likely to use CBT alone. The experts consider the combination of ERP as the optimal behavioral psychotherapy for OCD, while CT may provide additional benefit by directly targeting distorted 'OCD beliefs' and/or by improving compliance with ERP.In managing treatment-refractory patients, the experts suggest a variety of augmentation strategies that can be tried in OCD, including clomipramine, clonazepam, conventional neuroleptics, buspirone, risperidone, and a second SSRI added to the first. The choice of augmentation medications would have to be tailor made for each patient. Clomipramine may be useful in boosting the response of a patient treated with an SSRI who is not having an adequate response. Neuroleptics may be helpful for patients who have not had an adequate response to an SRI and who have a comorbid tic disorder, OCD symptoms such as compulsive touching that resembles tics, or a comorbid schizotypy. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting, technique, or intensity, or to switch to another SRI or an MAOI. Finally, in patients with extremely severe and non-remitting OCD, intravenous clomipramine, neurosurgery, or electro-convulsive therapy (if the patient is also depressed) may sometimes be considered.The case illustrated in here represents a typical obsessive compulsive patient. We offered her a CBT effective in 20 sessions. The Yates-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score dropped from 29 at the beginning of therapy to 13 at the end of the treatment. This decrease represents a 55% efficacy. Results were stable for the 1-year follow-up. The overall strategies for treatment of OCD are presented in figure 1. On the basis of the evidence available, the following approach is outlined.The first step in treating OCD is educating the patient and family about OCD and its treatment as a medical illness. During the last 20 years, two effective treatments have been developed: CBT and medication with a SSRI. Education is crucial in helping the patients and their families learn how to best manage OCD and prevent complications. CBT is the key element of treatment for most patients with OCD. Medication with SSRI is helpful for many patients, especially for patients with depression. The BT (ERP) involved systematic exposure to the obsessions as well as prevention of any compulsive or neutralizing behaviors that might be used to reduce anxiety. ERP did prove to be a very successful form of treatment for OCD, especially for those with washing and, to a lesser extent, checking rituals. Outcome studies of ERP indicate that approximated 70–80% of OCD patients who complete treatment show significant symptom improvement [55]. CT, which may be added to BT, addresses such dysfunctional beliefs as faulty estimation of the importance of thoughts, exaggerated sense of personal responsibility and perfectionism often seen in OCD patients. CT may also provide additional benefits by improving compliance with ERP. CT may also be of value for the substantial number of refusers and potential drop-outs of BT. Because of well-proven efficacy and safety profiles, the SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of patients with OCD. Patients who initially do not respond to SSRI therapy may benefit from switching to another SSRI or combining another medication or CBT with SSRI. There is evidence that addition of a neuroleptic may improve response to SSRI in some patients.Once OCD symptoms are eliminated or much reduced – a goal which is practical for the majority of those with OCD – then maintenance of treatment gains becomes the goal. When patients have completed a successful course of treatment for OCD, most experts recommend monthly follow-up visits for at least 6 months and continued treatment for at least 2 years before trying to stop medication or CBT. Relapse is very common when medication is withdrawn, particularly if the person has not felt the benefit of CBT. Therefore, many experts recommend continuing medication if the patients do not have access to CBT. Individuals with repeated episodes of OCD may need to receive long-term or even life-long prophylactic medication. The experts recommend such long-term treatment after 2–4 severe relapses or 3–4 milder relapses.The efficacy, acceptance and cost-effectiveness of short-term interventions for patients with OCD should certainly be further improved. The identification of factors which predict treatment response is a major goal. To effectively address the needs of individuals with severe and refractory OCD, current treatment strategies may need to be modified and supplemented. A promising area of research is the role of cognitive factors in OCD. Only the reports by Sookman and Pinard [48]have specifically examined the use of cognitive intervention with a difficult-to-treat sample of OCD patients. The apparent success of their cognitive treatment suggests that cognitive mechanisms could be involved in determining the severity or resilience of OCD. However, firm conclusions regarding the specific effects on cognitive intervention on severe or refractory OCD must await controlled studies.The authors wish to thank Emilie Aurouer for the English translation.'Case management' is a section which addresses biopsychosocial management of cases in clinical medicine.

The prominence of post-exertional exacerbation of fatigue is highlighted by the recently suggested re-naming as Syndrome of Exertional Intolerance Disease (SEID). Diagnosis is syndromic. No clinical test can confirm the presence of CFS. Treatment is supportive with no specific therapy shown to be reproducibly effective. There are several categories of hypotheses regarding CFS aetiology including infections, immune, mitochondrial, neurobehavioural or stress system (HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system) disorders. Recently, fatigue disorders have been popularly referred to as “adrenal fatigue.” Although CFS and the syndromically related fibromyalgia have been shown to have lower HPA axis function especially reduced cortisol, when analysed compared to controls in aggregate, and in some cases excessive sympathetic nervous system usually sympathoneural system responses, these findings overlap with controls and such testing is not diagnostic. Moreover, augmentation of cortisol levels with glucocorticoids has not been shown to be clinically useful. The stress system abnormalities may represent epiphenomena of the disease process rather than pathogenic abnormalities of importance to the symptomatology. Recent studies have pointed to new pathological associations and small treatment trials exist which hold some promise but require replication before practical application.",

PTSD may develop after a serious traumatic experience that induces feelings of intense fear, helplessness or horror. It is currently characterized by three key classes of symptoms which must cause clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning: (1) persistent and distressing re-experiencing of the trauma; (2) persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness; and (3) persistent symptoms of hyper-arousal. One of the possible symptoms within the second class is difficulty in remembering an important aspect of the traumatic event. PTSD is not an uncommon condition, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of about 7-9% based on studies conducted in the United States and Canada, with women at higher risk than men. While not everyone who experiences a significant trauma will go on to develop PTSD, about a third will do so. Sexual assault, along with other forms of assaultive violence, pose a comparatively high risk of PTSD.",

      "title": "The Occurrence of Funeral Mania After Bereavement: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Stressful or traumatic life events can lead to emergence of mood episodes. Events such as migration, relocation, job loss, bankruptcy, economic loss, divorce, natural disasters, accidental injury, or the loss of a loved one can trigger the first episode of bipolar disorder. After such life events, symptoms of depressive episodes often appear. Funeral mania, on the other hand, is defined as the emergence of manic episodes following the death of a close family member. Information on funeral mania, which occurs shortly after the loss of a loved one, is limited with a few case reports. In this study, a 26-year-old female patient who presented with the symptoms of a manic episode for the first time after her father's death and who had no previous psychiatric disease or treatment history was presented in the light of findings in the literature. It is noteworthy that the patient, who was followed up with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (mania period) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, had a temporal closeness between her mood symptoms and her father's death, and had not developed such a reaction to previous traumatic life events. Therefore, the diagnosis was evaluated as funeral mania. It should be kept in mind that, although rare, symptoms of mania can be seen among possible grief reactions.Strese neden olan ya da örseleyici yaşam olayları duygudurum dönemlerinin ortaya çıkmasına neden olabilir.

Are hysterical manifestations disappearing or do they take other forms? This question raises semantic and phenomenological problems concerning hysteria. A review of the literature shows the complexity and precariousness of some definitions, the question raised by associated organic disorders and the compounding influences of other nosological entities, such as depression and psychosomatic disorders. Clinical histories from the records of a psychiatric hospital for the period 1910-1929 were compared with those for the period 1970-1980. The results of the study were surprising with respect to the similarity of epidemiological profiles. If it can be concluded that hysterical manifestations are not disappearing, then the study confirms the evolution of symptomatology which, especially in women, takes atypical forms of depressive, neurovegetative or psychosomatic disorders. In males, hysterical symptoms are of a more acute nature and frequently occur in dependent, immature or infantile personalities, whilst in the past they were more chronic and frequently associated with more serious personality disorders.",

Depression not only portends current maladjustment but may also signal risk for recurrent or chronic depression and its associated impairment. Because depression is most often a response to stressful events and circumstances, it is important to understand the stress context itself. Individuals with depression histories are known to contribute to the occurrence of interpersonal and other stressors at a high rate, and for young women particularly, the occurrence of interpersonal stressors and conditions in turn predicts recurrences of depression, in a vicious cycle. Interpersonal dysfunction in early adolescence predicts the likelihood of continuing maladaptive functioning in peer, family, romantic, and parenting roles.

      "abstract": "Deprese je onemocnění, které zasahuje jak tělesnou schránku, tak i náladu a myšlení. Ovlivňuje spánek a stravovací návyky, způsob vlastní percepce stejně jako vnímání okolního světa. Deprese není známkou osobní slabosti nebo stavem, kterého se můžeme zbavit pouhým přáním nebo zapojením vůle. Lidé trpící depresí se nemohou jednoduše \"sebrat\" a uvolnit se. Je typické, že depresivní poruchy se vyskytují v různých formách. Soubory příznaků mohou přetrvávat po týdny, měsíce až roky, pokud nejsou léčeny. Odpovídající léčba na druhou stranu může pomoci většině populace trpící depresí. Máme k dispozici různé druhy antidepresiv, včetně těch nejnovějších, jako jsou - inhibitory zpětného vychytávání serotoninu (SSRIs) - stejně jako tricyklická antidepresiva a inhibitory monoamino-oxidázy (MAOIs). SSRI podobně jako další novější léky, ovlivňující přenašeče nervových vzruchů - např. dopamin nebo noradrenalin - mají obecně méně nežádoucích účinků než tricyklická antidepresiva. Vhodně zvolená psychoterapie v kombinaci s vhodným antidepresivem může podstatně přispět ke zlepšení kvality života lidí trpících depresí.",

      "abstract": "Distress is commonly characterized by prolonged internal suffering that can range from self-focused processing of negative emotions and stressors, to highly intensely aversive and prolonged emotional states thereby worsening or complicating emotional and physical conditions. Decentering represents a metacognitive capacity thought to reflect three interrelated processes: meta-awareness, disidentification from internal experience, and reduced reactivity to thought content—which is reliably increased with mindfulness-based interventions. In this essay, we seek to link the clinical presentation of distress disorders to known or hypothesized disruptions in neural networks that underlie emotion, cognition, and goal directed behavior, and offer a neurobehavioral account for how and why treatments imbued with mindfulness meditation might ameliorate these conditions, in part through increases in decentering.",

In addition, modifying psychological and social factors are discussed.Older adults appear to be at greater risk for major depression biologically, such as depression resulting from vascular changes, yet the frequency of depression is lower compared to younger adults. Older adults may be protected psychologically due to factors such as socio-emotional selectivity and wisdom, compared to younger adults, and perhaps relatively protected from social risks.A biopsychosocial approach to evaluating the origins of late-life depression is heuristically valuable, a continual reminder of the many factors that contribute to the onset and persistence of clinically significant symptoms in late life.",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "title": "The importance of measuring impulsiveness in patients with addiction problems",
      "abstract": "An impulse may be sudden, or it may be a steady rise in tension until it reaches a climax, whereupon it is acted out without regard to self or others. Impulsivity is actually evidenced behaviorally as carelessness, an underestimated sense of harm, extroversion, impatience, including the inability to delay gratification, and a tendency toward risk-taking, pleasure, and sensation seeking. Impulsivity has been defined as the failure to resist an impulse, drive, or temptation that is potentially harmful to oneself or others, and is a defining characteristic of a wide spectrum of psychiatric diseases, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar spectrum disorders, impulse control disorders, cluster B personality disorders, and addiction. Three cognitive components play an important role in modulating impulsivity: inability to delay gratification, distractibility, and disinhibition.1 In contrast to compulsivity, which is driven by an effort to reduce anxiety, impulsivity is driven by an effort to obtain arousal and gratification. However, individuals with both behavior problems have in common the inability to refrain from repetitive behaviors. Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder, characterized by a cycle of intoxication, binging, withdrawal, and craving, which results in excessive drug use despite adverse consequences. Drugs that have the potential for abuse and addiction increase dopamine (DA) levels in the reward circuit, and this characteristic is believed to underlie their reward effects. Previous clinical studies of addiction have focused on the midbrain DA-rich areas and the basal ganglia structures, which are involved in reward and conditioning. Recent clinical studies, however, have focused on the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in addiction. Disrupted PFC function contributes to impulsivity, compulsivity, risk-taking, and impaired self-monitoring in addicts, and leads to a syndrome of impaired response inhibition and salience attribution, characterized by attributing excessive salience to the drug, drug cues, decreased sensitivity to nondrug rewards, and decreased ability to inhibit maladaptive or risky behaviors. As a result, addicts tend to compulsively and impulsively seek and use the drug, lose the ability to limit intake, and suffer from a negative emotional state when access to the drug is prevented. As the addiction progresses, there is a shift from positive reinforcement driving the motivated behavior to negative reinforcement driving the motivated behavior (from liking to wanting). Thus, drug addiction has been conceptualized as a disorder which progresses from impulsivity to compulsivity. In addition, results from both human and animal studies have confirmed the association between addiction and impulsivity using different techniques.2 Impulsivity, expressed as impulsive decision-making and inhibitory failure to stop, plays an important role during different phases of addiction. In the beginning, impulsivity leads to drug abuse, which in turn increases impulsivity, contributing to risky, disinhibiting behaviors.3,4 Furthermore, chronic use of drugs of abuse lowers D2 DA receptor (DRD2) levels, and thus impairs PFC control of impulsivity. Animal studies first explored the connection between DRD2 and behavioral control, and the results of such studies clearly show a negative correlation between DRD2 and impulsivity, as well as a negative correlation between impulsivity and drug self-administration.5,6 In human cases with addiction problems, lower striatal DRD2 levels significantly correlated with lower brain glucose metabolism in key regions of the PFC, such as the orbitofrontal cortex (involved with salience attribution) and cingulate gyrus (involved with inhibitory control), disruption of which results in compulsivity and impulsivity.7,8 An association was also found between reduced baseline PFC and reduced striatal DRD2 levels in cases with addiction problems. This finding evinces the strong connections between neuroadaptations in PFC pathways and downstream dysfunctions in the DA reward and motivational systems, likely because of the influence of PFC on impulsivity.9 As for another important phase of addiction, craving, there are individual differences in the degree of cue-elicited craving. Impulsivity is again found to be one of the important personal factors. Individuals with higher impulsivity appeared to show ineffective response inhibition and more craving for substance-related cues.10 Another recent study, however, suggested a need to explore individual differences in compulsivity when addressing the links between craving and impulsivity in patients with opiate dependence, because the results of this study revealed that individual differences in compulsivity mediated the association between craving and inhibitory control in Stroop performance.11 Different deficits of impulse control may perhaps motivate drug use in a variety of ways. At present, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11) is one of the most commonly used measures to evaluate the symptoms of impulsivity and aggressions.12 The BIS-11 measures impulsivity in terms of three domains: motor impulsiveness, nonplanning impulsiveness, and attentional impulsiveness. By evaluating a patient's severity in each of the three domains, the scale is able to provide a description of impulsivity in individuals. It is a clinician-rated scale, and requires 10–15 minutes to complete the 30 items. It is easy to administer and widely used. As a variety of findings in the literature related to alcohol and stimulants have used the BIS-11 measures to examine the role of impulsivity in addiction,13 a study to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of BIS-11 in abstinent, opioid-dependent cases has been carried out.14 The report may help clinicians in Taiwan to detect individuals with a high risk of developing addiction problems, and to measure treatment retention and the possibility of relapse objectively.

      "title": "Fear conditioning to socially relevant stimuli in social anxiety",
      "abstract": "Los trastornos de ansiedad constituyen un reto para la psiquiatria y la psicologia clinica. Cerca de un 30% de la poblacion sufre, o ha sufrido, uno o mas trastornos de ansiedad a lo largo de su vida, siendo dicho grupo de trastornos el mas frecuente dentro del DSM-IV. Las aproximaciones teoricas basadas en los modelos de aprendizaje aversivo han ocupado un lugar muy importante entre los modelos etiologicos de dichos trastornos. A pesar de que el condicionamiento del miedo es un proceso adaptativo y de gran importancia para la supervivencia, puede acabar convirtiendose en clinicamente relevante cuando la reactividad al Estimulo Condicionado (EC) persiste en ausencia de contingencia entre el EC y el Estimulo Incondicionado (EI). Mediante procesos de condicionamiento clasico aversivo pueda aparecer un trastorno de ansiedad durante o despues de un acontecimiento traumatico o en un periodo de estres significativo. Sin embargo, no todas las personas expuestas a este tipo de sucesos acaban desarrollando un trastorno. Algunos estudios han demostrado un mayor condicionamiento y una mayor resistencia a la extincion en pacientes ansiosos comparados con controles sanos sugiriendo que pacientes con trastornos de ansiedad se caracterizan por una elevada condicionabilidad y que esta es una de las razones por las que, en situaciones de exposicion a incidentes aversivos, solo algunos individuos desarrollan miedos patologicos, mientras que otros muestran una respuesta adaptativa de miedo. La mayoria de estudios han utilizado el reflejo de sobresalto como indice de procesamiento afectivo. Consiste en una respuesta defensiva subita que presentan muchas especies animales ante un estimulo intenso e inesperado. En humanos, puede ser medido de forma bastante sencilla registrando la respuesta electromiografica en el musculo orbicularis oculi. El incremento del reflejo de sobresalto cuando un individuo esta experimentando un estado de miedo o ansiedad se denomina reflejo de sobresalto potenciado por miedo. Durante los ultimos anos, este se ha convertido en una herramienta de gran utilidad para la investigacion traslacional de los trastornos de ansiedad. La mayor parte de los trabajos han utilizado estimulos evolutivamente poco “preparados” y algunos no han demostrado mayor condicionabilidad en pacientes con trastornos de ansiedad. Esto nos alerta de la necesidad de emplear paradigmas que contemplen estimulos incondicionados mas relevantes para el trastorno objeto de estudio. Por tanto, el objetivo general del presente proyecto fue investigar el papel del condicionamiento aversivo de estimulos socialmente relevantes como factor especifico de vulnerabilidad a la fobia social, utilizando el reflejo de sobresalto en pacientes con fobia social respecto a pacientes con trastorno de panico con agorafobia y controles sanos. Para llevarlo a cabo, se empleo un paradigma de condicionamiento diferencial desarrollado por Lissek et al. (2008) en el que imagenes de personas con una expresion facial neutra (EC) se aparearon con tres tipos de estimulos visuales/auditivos: insultos y expresiones faciales de critica (EIneg); comentarios y expresiones faciales neutras (EIneu); y cumplidos y expresiones faciales positivas (EIpos). Los resultados del presente trabajo no demostraron una mayor condicionabilidad en pacientes con fobia social respecto a pacientes con trastorno de panico con agorafobia y controles sanos. Es posible que otros procesos tanto asociativos (por ejemplo, extincion del miedo) como no asociativos (por ejemplo, procesos cognitivos y atencionales) tengan un papel mas importante en la fobia social que un mayor condicionamiento.",

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

      "title": "OVERVIEW OF THE THEORIES OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION",
      "abstract": "Protecting mother and child health is a matter of great medical and social importance and calls for special attention to the quality of perinatal care. The necessity of studies of pregnant women psychosomatic state is defined by contemporary obstetrics goals: preventing complications during pregnancy and childbirth and reducing the frequency of behavioral problems after birth.Since ancient times postnatal period is associated with changes in female mental and emotional state. Childbirth is considered a stress factor and could affect significantly the mental balance of woman in child-birth.In the postnatal period mothers endure physiological and mental changes and many of them are vulnerable to different emotional symptoms \\12 including anxiety, depression and psychosis. The most common mental and emotional problem is postnatal depression. While postpartal emotional disbalance is usually benign and controllable, postnatal depression and postnatal psychosis cause considerable amount of stress and dysfunction. Postpartal depression is an issue of social and health significance and often can seriously deteriorate the quality of life not only of the mother, but as well as the family. With untreated depressive disorders there is a risk of recurrent illness and they are associated with long term cognitive, emotional and behavioral disorders in children. In the prevention of postpartal mental disorders is important to raise awareness of health professionals so that these conditions can be recognized early and treated in due course.Until now this complex disorder has not been studied well enough and there have been different theories about what is causing it. According to some authors before deciding on treatment options an evaluation has to be made of the theoretical reasons for the occurrence of PPD.Introducing health professionals working with women during the prenatal and postnatal period with the theoretical formulations of the problem can help them in developing strategies for prevention and treatment to prevent the disorder and to reduce the consequences.",

The present report verifies how age at onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and duration of illness are associated with comorbid diagnoses in OCD patients.Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using a structured clinical interview in 161 consecutive outpatients referred for treatment between 1996 and 2001 who met DSM-IV criteria for OCD. Age at onset and duration of illness were retrospectively assessed by direct interviews.An earlier age at onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms was associated with tic disorders, while longer illness duration was associated with depressive disorder (major depressive disorder or dysthymia) and social phobia.Age at onset and duration of OCD illness are meaningful variables affecting the expression of comorbidities in OCD. Tic disorders and OCD may share common etiologic pathways. Depressive disorders, in contrast, may be secondary complications of OCD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Most health care professionals who diagnose and treat mental disorders use the diagnostic criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition–Text Revised ( DSM-IV-TR ), which uses a multiaxial system to ensure a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the patient's presenting symptoms, general medical condition, psychosocial and environmental problems, and level of function. The five axes are mental disorders; personality and mental disorders; general medical conditions; psychosocial and environmental problems, and global assessment of functioning (GAF) scale. Psychosocial and environmental problems may affect diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mental disorders; the problems or stressors can contribute to the development of a mental disorder or can be the result of a mental disorder. The multiaxial assessment process should result in the following; documentation of the primary and any secondary mental and behavioral disorders; definition of physical disorders that may be present and indication if they are related to or influence the mental and behavioral disorders; identification of environmental stressors that may affect, contribute to, complicate, or exacerbate the mental and behavioral disorder; and a rating of the person's psychological, social, and occupational functioning. A table shows the GAF scale (ratings by deciles from 1 to 100; higher numbers indicate fewer problems) and does not include impairments that result from physical or environmental limitations.",

      "abstract": "WHY: Like others with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), older adults respond to traumatic events with symptoms of re-experiencing, emotional numbing, behavioral avoidance, and increased physiological arousal. Because of age-related changes and associated disease processes, stress reaction in older adults may lead to a deterioration of function and a worsening of existing conditions. Therefore, older adults should be considered a high risk group following a disaster or specific traumatic event. Several factors in adapting to a disaster have been recognized as important in the older adult: an increased sense of insecurity and vulnerability; a loss of sense of control and predictability; a need to reaffirm familiar relationships, attachments and routines; and to remain independent. The impact of a disaster on the elderly can be magnified by chronic illness and medication, sensory limitations, mobility impairment, and literacy that place the older adult in the special needs population after a disaster. For all of these reasons it is important to evaluate an older adult’s response to a disaster to detect those who are in danger of decompensating.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive. Specify if: Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.",

      "title": "Poslijeporođajna depresija i psihoza",
      "abstract": "Experiencing mood swings after giving birth can last over a longer period of time. Those mood swings are largely the result of hormonal changes and the physical process of recovery after childbirth. The relationship between the mother and her family members, the doctor, and the nurses, as well as their experiences together, are of great importance during pregnancy, giving birth and afterwards. Except for those factors and other risks, which can cause postnatal psychological changes, there are other conditions for postnatal depression to emerge, such as the characteristics of the mothers in terms of dealing with stressful situations, as well as their history of mental illnesses. Psychological changes after giving birth, mood disorders, are manifested in several ways: from the usual mild reactions of sadness, which spontaneously disappear in a few days, to difficult and severe disorders, which require a specialist’s intervention and often the hospitalisation of the mother. In those grave cases, the distorted perception of their child and surroundings can result in the mother harming herself or her child.\r\n Preventing serious troubles, helping the mother after childbirth, as well as recognizing the symptoms and reducing the risks of postnatal distress are responsibilities of healthcare professionals. Trained through education and courses, house visits, clinical examinations before, during and after birth, those primary and secondary medical care professionals continuously participate in the postnatal care of women. It is not only important to insure the healthcare for the mother and child’s physical wellbeing, but also taking care of their emotional needs.\r\n This paper aims to analyse some of the risk factors and prevention of postnatal depression and psychosis, and their connection.\r\n The results of the study performed have shown partial uniformity with other studies. 37% of the women questioned have experienced postnatal sadness and 16% have experienced postnatal depression. However, it has been found that 3% of the female testimonies have shown a postnatal psychosis. Of all the symptoms, the women questioned have selected “feeling tired” and “lack of energy” to the greatest extent. The smallest number have selected recurring “suicidal thoughts” and “thoughts of death”. The results suggest the presence of light and temporary mood swings, but also show a small amount of severe problems, which can be identified as disorders.",

      "title": "Are antidepressants effective in cancer patients?",
      "abstract": "Much work has been carried out to evaluate the physical sequelae of cancer, but relatively little research has been carried out into the psychological and psychiatric sequelae. Depression is a significant symptom for many palliative care patients but is under recognised and frequently not treated (1–3). Depression is characterised by persistent low mood (dysphoria) and loss of interest in activities (anhedonia). The clinical diagnosis of depression is made according to criteria, e.g. DSM-IV criteria. Depression is an illness with no distinct biological markers or effective diagnostic test. The physician must rely upon skill and knowledge in differentiating depression from ‘appropriate sadness’ or grief reactions as the end of life approaches (4). Low mood can be seen as a continuous variable in cancer patients. Physicians need to seek symptoms actively and not expect the patient to report them spontaneously. Non-disclosure by the patient may occur for a number of reasons. The cancer patient may already feel stigmatised and the physician may believe that the added label of depression may enhance stigmatisation and, therefore, mental suffering; however, most patients are accepting of treatment (5). Physicians may attribute somatic symptoms of depression to the cancer illness, highlighting their tendency to separate mental from physical health as described by Tucker (6). Block (7) suggested hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, guilt and suicidal ideation as better indicators of depression. The diagnosis of depression relies on clinical judgement. However, poor detection remains a significant problem; Maguire (8) stated that up to 80% of developed psychological morbidity remains unrecognised and untreated. A study in 2004 by Lawrie et al. (9) found that whilst 73% of palliative care physicians routinely assessed for depression, 61% reported difficulties with assessment and management of depression and wanted more training in this area. The treatment of depression can improve quality of life and also the palliation of other symptoms. All patients identified as depressed require psychosocial support. There is considerable interest in the role of counselling for depression. Many patients find the opportunity to talk about their concerns and fears to be helpful and may find this opportunity from their clinical nurse specialist, doctor, paramedical staff and clergy. A recent study suggested that although counselling can be considered appropriate treatment in some cases (10), antidepressants have a faster onset of action and more appropriate for patients with a short life expectancy, i.e. patients with advanced cancer.",

It is believed to be of psychological origin but may involve both cerebral and peripheral physiological mechanisms. It is often associated with depression. Its assessment and management need to be multifactorial, i.e., medical, psychosocial and psychiatric.A thorough initial medical assessment is crucially important in order to identify any organic contributory factors and to gain the patient's trust. It is also essential to carry out a psychosocial and psychiatric assessment so as to evaluate the role of psychological and socioeconomic factors and establish whether a diagnosable psychiatric disorder is present. The latter is most likely to be a depressive, anxiety, or somatoform disorder.If the medical assessment fails to come up with a plausible organic explanation for the patient's pain, he or she should be told so clearly. The patient should be told that the goal of the treatment is not to cure the pain but to help him/her improve his/her functioning and sense of control over pain and life generally. The type of management most likely to succeed in this goal is one that is multifactorial and comprehensive rather than focused on one treatment modality only.Key Words: painsomatizationhysteria",

En rekke epidemiologiske undersøkelser der psykologiske stressmålinger er kombinert med kliniske undersøkelser av periodontale forhold, tyder på at også periodontal sykdom forverres ved stressfaktorer som negative livshendelser, depresjoner, arbeidsrelaterte krav, arbeidsløshet, finansielle problemer og lignende. Epidemiologiske statistiske metoder annvendt som kan skille ut effekten av stressfaktorer fra andre kjente risikofaktorer forbundet med helse eller atferd, eksempelvis diabetes eller røyking. I den enkelte undersøkelse kan det likevel være vanskelig å fastslå at den påviste sammenhengen er av kausal natur. Den overveiende del av de foreliggende epidemiologiske data kan imidlertid tolkes i retning av at stressfaktorer er av betydning for periodontal sykdom. Flere undersøkelser viser at god mestringsevne overfor stresspåvirkning er forebyggende med hensyn til utvikling av sykdom.",

      "title": "Postconcussion Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "abstract": "Depression is recognised as the most common mental health disorder in the elderly. It does not only increase the morbidity, but it increases the mortality as well. Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

      "abstract": "The concept of allostasis emphasizes that healthy functioning requires continual adjustments to the internal physiological milieu. Allostatic load reflects the cumulative effects of stressful experiences in daily life. When the cost of chronic exposure to fluctuating or heightened neural or neuroendocrine responses exceeds the coping resources of an individual, allostatic overload ensues. So far these issues have been addressed only on pathophysiological terms that do not find application in clinical settings. However, several features that have been described in psychosomatic research may allow the assessment of allostatic load on clinical grounds. Clinimetric criteria for the determination of allostatic overload are suggested. They are based on: (a) the presence of a stressor exceeding individual coping skills, and (b) clinical manifestations of distress. They may provide specification to the fourth axis of DSM, may supplement the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research, and may help discriminate neuroendocrine patterns with important clinical and research implications. A state of allostatic overload is frequently associated with alterations in biological markers and calls for a close medical evaluation of the patient's condition. The ultimate goal is to be able to prevent or decrease the negative impact of excessive stress on health.",

Acute pain is predictable following surgical intervention; chronic pain is less so. Chronic pain, persisting for longer than 3 months, or beyond expected wound healing, is a worldwide problem affecting around 20% of the adult population. Chronic postsurgical pain is multifactorial, although it often involves some form of nerve damage, with clinical signs consistent with this. Neuropathic pain may have a greater impact on quality of life than other chronic pain syndromes. It is important, therefore, to identify neuropathic pain as early as possible, in order to initiate appropriate management and reduce longer-term impact. This chapter focuses on two types of neuropathic pain: chronic postsurgical pain and complex regional pain syndrome.",

The chapter differs from others in the AMA Guides insofar as it does not provide percentages for estimates of mental impairment because such usage suggests a certainty that does not exist. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, is a widely accepted classification system for mental disorders, but it omits context. Few clinically standardized tests can identify functional or structural effects, and neuropsychological testing is not the standard for documenting subtle impairment. How individuals manage their illness and cope with life demands are better measures of impairment than diagnostic labels or numbers and kinds of symptoms. Further, assessment requires an evaluation of the context in which the illness unfolds, including premorbid function and previous response to treatment; details about the individual's life course; review of developmental and functional deficits; character style and comorbidities such as anxiety and substance abuse; severity of precipitants, current stage of the episode, and current effectiveness of treatment; and external supports that can moderate impairment. A table lists areas of functional impairment, symptoms to consider, and patient history relevant to symptoms.",

      "title": "Understanding Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Management Options",
      "abstract": "Obsessive compulsive disorder is a common mental health problem. It is characterized by obsession and compulsion. Obsession can be defined as unwanted, intrusive, recurrent and persistent thoughts, images or impulses which are not voluntarily produced, but are experienced as events that invade a person's consciousness. Compulsion can be defined as repetitive and seemingly purposeful behavior that is performed according to certain rules or in a stereotyped fashion and is not an end in itself but is usually intended to prevent some event or situation. The obsessions or compulsions interfere significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational functioning, usual social activities, or relationships. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and several related disorders are now put together into separate chapter in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). Literature search was performed with the key words \"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\", \"Obsession\", \"Compulsion\", \"Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\". Representative and leading researches from last 25 years were included in the study. Modern concepts of OCD began to evolve in the nineteenth century. Obsessions, in which insight was preserved, were gradually distinguished from delusions, in which it was not. The core features of OCD are remarkably similar from one country to the next, but its manifestations may differ for reasons of culture and experience. OCD is typically a chronic disorder with a waxing and waning course. In classical psychoanalytic theory, OCD was considered a regression from the Oedepal phase to the anal psycho-sexual phase of development. Functional brain imaging studies have produced a model for pathophysiology of OCD which involves hyperactivity in certain subcortical and cortical regions. The idea that abnormality in serotonergic neurotransmission underlies OCD arose from the observation that clomipramine, which inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, relieved symptoms, whereas noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors did not. During the last 40 years there has been considerable progress in the pharmacological management of OCD. Behavioral therapy is also considered as an effective way of controlling OCD. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a well-documented intervention for children, adolescents, and adults with OCD. Other biological approaches for obsessive-compulsive disorder include neurosurgery, deepbrain stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The neurosurgical techniques of cingulotomy and capsulotomy may provide clinical improvement among some patients with treatmentrefractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Overall, stereotactic surgery should be viewed as a last option in treating refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Faridpur Med. Coll. J. Jan 2020;15(1): 38-42",

      "abstract": "Trauma is like an emotional shockan experience that is too overwhelming to process during or immediately after the traumatic event or situation.Normally, with support and over time the person naturally recovers from the trauma and can integrate their traumatic experience as part of their personal history.The trauma becomes a memory that can be thought of and described.When someone is traumatized as in PTSD, instead of a conscious memory the trauma continues to exist in the present as physical sensations, such as fear, panic, and rage.The person may not be able to connect these feelings to anything that has happened.Such disturbing sensations and feelings become a threat in themselves, so all aspects of everyday life are organised to avoid situations that may trigger them.Trauma during the early years can be particularly damaging because the child's brain is not fully developed.Therefore, the natural development process can also be disrupted and distorted.Trauma alters patterns in the brain.Chemicals such as adrenaline and cortisone are produced in excess, initially as a necessary survival response, i.e. to prepare a person's body to take flight from the threat.Trauma that is repeated over time, often in many different forms, such as physical, emotional and sexual abuse, as well as neglectbecomes what is known as complex trauma.This can have a profound effect on a child's psychological, biological and social functioning.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, pain along with respiratory rate, body temperature, hart rate, arterial blood pressure breathing, temperature, pulse and pressure is considered the fifth vital sign. It is often stated that the pain is the most common symptom in clinical practice, a frequent cause of functional impairment of individual inability to function in a normal way, and the most common reason for seeking medical help. In patients who suffer from a long-term feeling of intense pain, efficiency and working ability are reduced and their emotional state is damaged as well. Due to long-term treatment and damaged everyday functioning, these patients often find themselves as social and financial issues. Knowledge about pain goes back far into the history of medical science and says that pain is a symptom of disease and will disappear when the underlying disease is cured. Nowadays, especially the chronic pain is identified as an independent health issue that can and must be treated. The pain is not only the transmission of impulses from the place of injury to the perception area of the brain but a phenomenon that is influenced by factors quantitative, qualitative and sensory, as well as cultural, social and economic. In addition to physical damage, the combination of psychological, social and spiritual component leads us to the concept of total pain definition. Therefore, it is necessary to act to all these causes for complete pain relief. Pain is an important public health issue worldwide. Despite the tremendous progress of science with new technological discoveries and pharmacological agents, pain is still a worldwide problem. It is a basic human right to live without pain, which means that the health care system is responsible to provide help to anyone who feels pain.",

The pain treatment armamentarium includes medication; physical therapy; occupational therapy; interventional anesthesiological procedures; psychological treatment; neuropharmacological treatment; work hardening and much more. With the development of chronicity, the initial pain-related diagnosis becomes only one of several diagnoses—including, possibly, depression, anxiety disorder, and iatrogenic substance abuse—all of which must be identified and treated for the patient to achieve some return to function, wellness/work or reduction in symptomatology.",

Instead, different triggering factors causing periods of low mood can give rise to different and sometimes even opposite symptom patterns. Some of the symptoms of depression are maladaptive; others may be psychobehavioural adaptions to solve the adaptive problem that triggered the depressive episode. It is therefore logical to subtype depressive episodes according to their triggering factors. In evolutionary psychiatry, depressive episodes can be classified into discrete subtypes that are induced by infection, long-term stress, loneliness, traumatic experience, hierarchy conflict, grief, romantic relationship dissolution, post-partum events, season, chemicals, somatic diseases and starvation. In hunter-gatherers and in people who have traditional lifestyles, periods of low mood only rarely turn into episodes that fulfil the diagnostic criteria of major depressive disorder. Modern lifestyles cause low-grade inflammation and an increased susceptibility to chronic stress, which introduce symptoms of sickness behaviour into reactive short-term mood changes. Therefore, features of contemporary environments may prevent the normalisation of mood after adverse life events, resulting in major depressive disorder. An evolutionary approach to depression helps to identify the factors in our environments and lifestyles that contribute to greater susceptibility to this debilitating disorder, which can inform both prevention and treatment of depression. We further propose that the treatment of major depressive disorder should be tailored according to the patient’s depression subtype, focusing on the root causes of the disorder rather than alleviating symptoms with drugs.",

These concepts - and related practices - are not as straight-forward as is often assumed in mainstream psychology. On the contrary, they have complex and far-reaching problematic implications for our understanding of agency, difficulties, dilemmas and suffering of concrete subjects, as well as for our practices. This article discusses the conceptualisation of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is in widespread use in most countries. Using this diagnosis as an example, some problems concerning diagnoses in general are introduced. Drawing on a study of women exposed to sexualised coercion, ‘symptoms’ of PTSD are reinterpreted. Trauma is understood as processes of a personal and overpowering sense of loss of control in specific times and places, and thus as embedded in the conduct of everyday lives. ‘Symptoms’ of PTSD are therefore reinterpreted as aspects of overpowering and violent personal meanings and as situated consequences of loss of control. Violent experiences and their consequences do not simply provoke ‘reactions’, as is assumed in the use of the diagnosis. As a result, its description of recurring thoughts and feelings concerning ‘traumatising events’ may be understood as recurring specific and personal attempts at dealing with, and learning from, violent loss of control.",

      "abstract": "I should like to conclude by a restatement of the principles of therapy submitted for your consideration and which have been illustrated by several clinical examples. 1. Affects, moods or emotions are psycho-physiological states which tend to augment or decrease pathophysiological states. 2. The interaction of pharmacological agents with certain affects or emotions may be synergistic or antagonistic. 3. A patient reacts to his disease, to his treatment, and to his physician with manifest psychological, cultural, and—for want of a better term—physiological regression. Where the regression is not manifest there are obvious pathological efforts of the patient to obscure it. 4. By means of iatrogenically induced regression it is possible to bring about new affects or mood states. 5. The bodily functions which are psycho-physiologically excited or inhibited by the regression or the defenses against it either increase or oppose the pathophysiology of the disease.",

Research shows that the incidence of postpartum depression is 1 to 2 of 1000 births and that 25% of mothers who have just given birth experience severe postpartum depression and that in mothers giving birth to their next child around 20%. Symptoms of postpartum depression include depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in the activity, impaired appetite, sleep disturbance, physical agitation or psychomotor slowdown, weakness, feeling useless, difficulty concentrating, even suicidal ideation. It is important to do an early diagnosis of postpartum depression to both prevent and make symptoms worse. Mothers with postpartum depression need to get broad and maximum management from various parties, including families, closest people, and health workers from multidisciplinary sciences. In its handling, non-pharmacological therapies can be given such as psychological therapy and changes in daily behavior and also pharmacological therapies that previously need to be consulted to doctors such as tricyclic antidepressant drugs (TCAs) to reduce symptoms of postpartum depression.",

En el caso de la depresión, la última clasificación de la Asociación Americana de Psiquiatría (DSM-5) (2013) sustituyó el especificador “de comienzo en el posparto” por “con inicio en el periparto” porque muchas depresiones posparto comienzan en el embarazo. Empero, la denominación posparto sigue siendo válida, y debe conservarse con independencia de si su inicio fue en el posparto (hasta seis meses después del parto) o en el embarazo. Los síntomas depresivos puerperales pueden encontrarse en la disforia, la DPP (monopolar o bipolar) o la psicosis afectiva puerperal. La DPP y la psicosis comprometen el funcionamiento materno y se asocian a alteraciones del vínculo madre/hijo(a). El tratamiento oportuno y la prevención de estos trastornos minimizan los riesgos y favorecen la salud de la madre y su descendencia. The puerperium is a period of increased psychic vulnerability and postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common obstetric complication. In the last classification of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5) (2013), the specifier “with postpartum onset” was replaced by the specificer “with peripartum onset” to acknowledge the fact that many PPDs start during pregnancy. However, the postpartum denomination remains a valid one and should be kept regardless the depression started in pregnancy or up to six months postpartum. Puerperal depressive symptoms may be found in the postpartum blues, unipolar or bipolar PPD or puerperal affective psychosis. PPD and psychosis cause impairment of maternal functioning and affect the mother-infant relationship. Timely treatment and prevention of these disorders minimize risks and favour the health of the mother and that of the offspring.",

This modality shows strong limits namely in the case of sudden and unexpected violent behaviours, of adhesion to terrorist groups or to criminal regimes, of somatic pathologies, of deficiencies in the development of functions. Utilising psychoanalytic, or psychoanalytically inspired literature, history documents, and clinical examples, a different assessment modality is proposed, both of pathological conditions and of the outcome of treatment: classification of levels of health is based on the degree of connection between different systems of the organism, which are also strongly related to the development of functions, such as dreaming, reflective capacity or affect regulation. Psychic, but also somatic symptoms often appear in this view not as the essence of pathology but as useful alarm signals and forms of communication; at any rate, they should be considered in conjunction with the proposed dimension.",

      "title": "A CONTRIBUTION TO THE NOSOLOGY OF THE IMPULSE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "We have presented certain clinical pictures typified by a disorder of impulse. This disorder may express itself in a rather specific symptomatic disturbance appearing as an impulse neurosis, a perversion, or a catathymic crisis. On the other hand, the disturbance may be more diffuse and nonspecific, pervading the total personality and behavior of the individual, expressing itself in a character disorder. In the impulsive character disorder we sometimes find evidence of a relationship to organic factors. However, there is another large group belonging to the impulsive character disorders which does not show such evidence of organicity and yet is characterized by the same infantile, explosive, impulsive behavior seen in the former. In surveying the genetic and dynamic factor, it is apparent that no one factor in and of itself determines the development of an impulse disorder. Constitutional factors, early developmental experiences, present-day forces and stresses impinging upon the individual contribute to the efficacy of the control apparatus or to the strength of drive. Constitutionally, varying drive and control potentials, physiologically as well as psychologically, interweave with early developmental experiences. Among the latter are psychological ones such as oral traumata possibly leading to an intolerance of frustration with demands for immediate gratification. Interference with speech-action relationships may result in the latter persisting as the medium of communication, thus leading to a tendency toward acting out. Physiologically, illness and physical traumata may increase the strength of the drives or weaken the control apparatus. The constitutional and early developmental experiences may lend a quality of impulsivity to the character, which in the face of current forces and stresses may result in impulsive behavior. Specific early experiences may supply the clinical clothing which envelopes the impulse skeleton leading to either direct or distorted expression of a given early impulse. The result is a wide array of clinical syndromes, which have as their common denominator an impulse disorder.",

However, no evidence exists that psychological symptoms are directly related to hormonal changes during the climacteric. Psychological and social factors not specifically related to the climacteric appear to be an important predictor of psychological complaints during this period. Menopause has for long been regarded as a deficiency disease, requiring medical attention and hormone replacement therapy. However, it may be concluded that oestrogen is only a specific treatment for hot flushes and dyspareunia, but has no clear role in the management of psychological symptoms in menopausal women. A multifactorial approach, paying attention simultaneously to biological, psychological and social factors supposed to influence complaints during the climacteric may be more appropriate. A description of an integration of medical and cognitive‐behavioural treatment procedures in case of climacteric symptoms is given.",

      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

Psychosomatic concept is an inter-relationship of Mind (Manas) and body (Sharira). The diseases evolving due to mind-body interaction are termed as psychosomatic diseases.[1] Vega means the natural urges of the body and mind. Dharaniya Vega are the suppressible or controllable urges which are not only confined to psychological attribute but also to verbal and physical attributes.[2] Some diseases or their subtypes in Ayurveda are nomenclatured based on suppressible urges like Shokaja Atisara (diarrhea due to grief), Bhayaja Atisara (diarrhea due to fear), Kamaj Jwara (fever due to passion),etc.[3,4] Sattvavajay Chikitsa given in Charak Samhita is a psychotherapy which literary means controlling the mind from unhealthy actions which has been developed as a counselling tool. Conclusion- The study will provide clinical evidence that will establish,the role of Dharaniya Vega in remedial or prevention of psychosomatic diseases and the role of Sattvavajay chikitsa in Dharaniya Vega",

      "abstract": "The three types of pain related to exercise are 1) pain experienced during or immediately following exercise, 2) delayed onset muscle soreness, and 3) pain induced by muscle cramps. Each is characterized by a different time course and different etiology. Pain perceived during exercise is considered to result from a combination of factors including acids, ions, proteins, and hormones. Although it is commonly believed that lactic acid is responsible for this pain, evidence suggests that it is not the only factor. However, no single factor has ever been identified. Delayed onset muscle soreness develops 24-48 hours after strenuous exercise biased toward eccentric (muscle lengthening) muscle actions or strenuous endurance events like a marathon. Soreness is accompanied by a prolonged strength loss, a reduced range of motion, and elevated levels of creatine kinase in the blood. These are taken as indirect indicators of muscle damage, and biopsy analysis has documented damage to the contractile elements. The exact cause of the soreness response is not known but thought to involve an inflammatory reaction to the damage. Muscle cramps are sudden, intense, electrically active contractions elicited by motor neuron hyperexcitability. Although it is commonly assumed that cramps during exercise are the result of fluid electrolyte imbalance induced by sweating, two studies have not supported this. Moreover, participants in occupations that require chronic use of a muscle but do not elicit profuse sweating, such as musicians, often experience cramps. Fluid electrolyte imbalance may cause cramps if there is profuse prolonged sweating such as that found in working in a hot environment. Thus, despite the common occurrence of pain associated with exercise, the exact cause of these pains remains a mystery.",

      "title": "The prevalence of posttraumatic psychopathology in the general and the clinical population.",
      "abstract": "Since the beginning of psychiatry, there has been a controversy about the consequences of traumatic events. Although there is no real dispute about human suffering caused by extreme stress events, social scientists have wondered whether traumatic events could lead to lasting psychopathology. This dispute was very strong in the first two versions of the the diagnostic and statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association, which came out in 1952 and 1968. In DSM I (1), trauma could only lead to \"gross stress reactions\", which were part of \"transient situational personality disorders\". Extreme stress events were thought to lead only to a transient/temporary disturbance and if there was more disturbance than that, another diagnostic label had to be found. This attitude towards trauma has changed over the years and from 1980, in DSM III, there emerged the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, a disorder which can be lasting or transient (2). In the past years, it has become clear that posttraumatic stress disorders are not the only form of psychopathology that follows after traumatic events. Major depressive episodes and dissociative disorders can also follow traumatic events. In this article, the results of two studies are reviewed. The first is a survey of the major studies into the prevalence of disorders after traumatic events. The main conclusion of this study shows that about 20% of the people that go through severely distressing events develop severe disorders. The second study focuses on the prevalence of disorders in the process of coping with traumatic events in a psychiatric outpatient clinic. Results of this study showed that clinically significant signs of these disorders were found to be present in 18% of the psychiatric outpatient referrals. In the discussion, the conclusion is drawn that posttraumatic psychopathology is a phenomenon that every clinician is confronted with on a regular basis. We might then wonder why specific treatment for posttraumatic psychopathology is still such a neglected area in psychiatry and psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sir: Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in motor behavior and changes in thought, mood, and vigilance 1 and occurs in a variety of medical and neuropsychiatric conditions. 2 Catatonia has been documented as occurring in alcohol withdrawal in rodents, 3 but not in humans.We report the case of a patient in whom alcohol withdrawal presented as catatonia.Case report.Mr. A, aged 35 years, presented in January 2006 with a history of alcohol use over the last 10 years.He fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence for the last 5 years.He presented with tremors, irritability, anorexia, and insomnia within 24 hours of abrupt cessation of alcohol intake.Seventy-two hours after cessation of alcohol intake, he developed signs of negativism, mutism, and psychomotor agitation lasting 2 days, followed by psychomotor retardation, stereotypies, and stupor over the next 2 days, fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for catatonia.There were no psychotic or mood symptoms, clouding of consciousness, disorientation, or any general medical condition that could explain these symptoms.He had experienced a similar episode 2 years previous, following 3 days of abstinence from alcohol, that remitted upon treatment with lorazepam.Family history was positive for alcohol dependence in first-and second-degree relatives but was negative for psychotic or mood disorders.The findings of laboratory investigations were within normal limits.As the patient's condition could not be described adequately by DSM-IV criteria for alcohol withdrawal or catatonia, the diagnosis of alcohol-induced psychotic disorder was made, with onset during alcohol withdrawal and presenting with catatonia.Mr. A was treated with lorazepam 16 mg per day and with vitamin supplements.His symptoms remitted completely within 72 hours.Catatonia has been documented in alcohol dependence in relation to drug interactions involving disulfiram 4 and in delirium. 1 The temporal correlation between alcohol abstinence and the appearance of catatonia in the absence of these other causes suggests that the catatonia in this case was due to alcohol withdrawal.Perturbations in γaminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic transmission have been implicated in the pathophysiology of both catatonia 2 and alcohol withdrawal. 5,6 Furthermore, the GABA A modulator lorazepam is effective in both conditions. 1,7 To our knowledge, this case is the first such case reported in the literature.",

The classical characteristics of psychosis are impaired reality testing, hallucinations, delusions, and illusions. While factitious disorder and malingering are usually acknowledged as contrived psychiatric conditions for acquisition of interior or exterior profits, respectively, another alternative, also, exists that though is not manufactured individually, is enforced peripherally. Such cases, which are usually referred by the judge’s ruling, for evaluation and treatment, are more important than comparable simulated or genuine mental conditions, because incorrect diagnosis, or careless, cagily, and guarded validation of preliminary diagnosis that has been issued in the authorized or emergency department, can seriously endanger the individual’s civil rights, while it should not be overlooked that incorrect diagnosis is a kind of malpractice that may harm an individual awfully. In the present article the clinical picture of the said situation, in addition to some case histories, and recommendable hints for differential diagnosis between different types of psychoses, has been discussed.",

      "abstract": "Survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at increased risk for development of severe, long-term psychiatric disorders. However, the aetiology of these disorders remains unclear. This article systematically reviews the most current prevalence rates and evidence for causality, in terms of established criteria.Psychiatric syndromes are consistently present at an elevated rate following TBI. Survivors of TBI are particularly susceptible to major depression, generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Evidence for a biological gradient is generally lacking, although this criterion may not be appropriate in the case of TBI. The temporal pattern of onset is variable and reliable critical periods for the post-injury development of a psychiatric disorder remain to be identified; however, individuals appear to remain at risk for years following injury.Non-organic factors, including pre-morbid personality traits and post-injury psychological reactions to disability and trauma, are implicated in the generation and maintenance of post-TBI psychiatric disorder. There remains insufficient evidence to conclude what role the neuropathological consequences of TBI play in the development of post-TBI psychiatric disorder.",

      "title": "Feeling emotional: the amygdala links emotional perception and experience",
      "abstract": "The term ‘emotion’ most commonly denotes a specific phenomenal state, such as the solemn weightiness associated with sadness or the lightness of being associated with joy. Human affective neuroscience has begun to pin down the elusive neuroanatomy of these most experientially prominent of mental experiences. One of the brain structures consistently associated with emotional functioning is the amygdaloid complex (Phan et al., 2002). Numerous neuroimaging studies have shown the amygdala varies with emotional experience in both healthy and mood disordered populations, pointing to its central role in emotional phenomenology. One difficulty with this apparent association is that emotion like cognition is not a single entity but is a multi-component process. Emotions reflect a constellation of diverse but correlated central neurocognitive and peripheral physiologic events. For example, witnessing a gruesome automobile accident is highly negatively valent, may involve specific appraisals related to fear or sadness, results in central and peripheral autonomic arousal, is attention grabbing thereby demanding to be the central focus of awareness, and in the following months and years may be associated with vivid reminiscences. In the safer confines of the lab or the bore of an MRI scanner, the amygdala has been associated to some extent with all of these putative functions. As such, amygdala activity may represent the generation of emotional experience itself, and/or it may reflect sundry aspects of emotional information processing correlated with emotional experience. In this issue, Feldman Barrett et al. demonstrate amygdala responses represent a critical nexus between the propensity for emotional experience and emotional interactions with perceptual encoding. The amygdala's role in feeling emotions may be tied to enhanced sensitivity toward emotional perception.\r\n\r\nFeldman Barrett et al. examined amygdala activation and its relation to emotional experience through the use of experience sampling. For 1 month three times daily, participants were probed via handheld PDA to indicate their present emotional state. One year following, participants were presented with backwardly masked fearful facial expressions during fMRI to index sensitivity of perceptual encoding of emotional events. Individual differences in propensity for negative affect, as indexed by experience sampling, were correlated with magnitude of amygdala response to presented fear faces. Moreover, in participants reporting increased anxiety during scanning, amygdala responses were associated with enhanced perceptual encoding of faces as indicated by increased fusiform activity. These results suggest that the amygdala may contribute to emotional experience by setting the appropriate preconditions for its expression: enhancing attention and associated perceptual encoding of emotional events, and thereby increasing their subjective salience.\r\n\r\nConsidering the mounting neuroimaging evidence consistent with an important role of the amygdala in generating affective experience there is surprisingly little direct evidence of disordered emotional experience following amygdala damage (Anderson and Phelps 2000; Anderson and Phelps 2002; Tranel et al., 2006), compared with evidence of the amygdala's central role in the emotional enhancement of mnemonic (Cahill et al., 1995) and perceptual processes (Anderson and Phelps 2001; Vuilleumier et al., 2004; Adolphs et al., 2005). For instance, patients with amygdala lesions provide retrospective reports of affective states (daily reflections) and traits (yearly reflections) of similar magnitude, frequency and underlying covariance structure to healthy controls (Anderson and Phelps, 2002). When asked to relive emotions, examinations of facial efference reveal that patients with bilateral amygdala damage display remarkably intact emotional expressions, including fear, despite pronounced impairments in the perception of these same signals (Anderson and Phelps, 2000). The results of such lesion studies, however, regard introspective emotional experiences that are associated with complex abstract factors and not directly tied to momentary environmental events. Many emotional experiences involve ruminations upon the past or future, thereby involving representations of threats and rewards in the absence of in the moment environmental stimulation. Such forms of emotional replay and forecasting may depend upon evolutionary more recent prefrontal neocortical representations rather than the amygdala alone. By contrast, the results of Feldman-Barrett et al. suggest that the amygdala's role is more related to momentary experiential states and enhanced attention and sensitivity toward encoding events surrounding these states.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala is neuroanatomically positioned to make a rapid and coarse appraisal of the state of the world, and via robust feedback projections, alter the perceptual process by enhancing the encoding of events of potential self importance. Neuroimaging studies have shown that emotionally arousing scenes vigorously engage early primary and secondary visual cortex (Bradley et al., 2003). Emotions thus bias attention to focus on events associated with subjective and physiologic arousal, shaping the ultimate contents of awareness (Anderson, 2005). Such arousal based modulatory effects depend on the integrity of the amygdala, with amygdala lesions eliminating the subjective biasing of perception toward the significant relative to the mundane, rendering the attentional landscape flat (Anderson and Phelps, 2001). Directly corroborating the results of Feldman-Barrett, enhanced extrastriate cortical responses to facial expressions of fear are correlated with magnitude of amygdala response (Morris et al., 1998), and these enhanced extrastriate responses are abolished following amygdala damage (Vuilleumier et al., 2004). The amygdala's role in evaluating the emotional value of fearful faces similarly depends on the ability to correctly attend to and encode their important features (Adolphs et al., 2005). If all the world's a stage, then the amygdala may be the emotional spotlight, shedding light on the most dramatic players of our life story.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala may thus represent embodied attention—the crucial link between central (mental) and peripheral (bodily) resources. Attention and awareness should be coupled with information of sufficient importance to result in autonomic activation and associated mobilization of peripheral metabolic resources, such as through altered respiration and heart rate. This redirecting of bodily physiologic resources may serve as the common primitive foundations of both attention and emotional experience. This common origin supports why emotional states are strongly correlated with how we think about and perceive the environment (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005; Rowe et al, 2007). More than a simple correlation, Feldman-Barrett et al.'s results suggest that emotional experience and individual differences therein may critically depend upon how we attend to the world (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005). Rather than being an ancillary consequence of, altered attention to emotional events may be part and parcel of emotional experience itself.",

In order to assess the magnitude of this phenomenon, the authors have reviewed 135 cases of posttraumatic unconsciousness lasting more than 2 weeks, from among the entire propulation of patients with severe head injury managed in 10 years in their neurosurgical intensive care unit. The incidence of prolonged coma was 4% of all patients with acute traumatic coma, and 0.6% of all hospitalized patients with head injury. By 1 year after trauma, 30% of the patients had died, 8% survived in a vegetative state, 31% survived with severe disabilities, and 31% had made a satisfactory recovery. The early clinical picture of prolonged unconsciousness has no predictive value as to further evolution. Patients emerge from unconsciousness in consecutive steps representing the restoration of increasingly complex neurological functions; the timing of these steps is very variable and sometimes covers several months. The time distribution of recovery steps in individual cases is of limited predictive value as to outcome. The most frequent state during the recovery process is the condition of wakefulness without awareness, which should not be pronounced “permanent” earlier than 1 year after injury.",

      "title": "The Nature of Psychotic Symptoms",
      "abstract": "A hypothesis raised in the first edition of this book, that psychotic symptoms often originate in traumatic experiences and relate to dissociation, is updated and expanded in this chapter. Evidence now demonstrates that traumatic experiences clearly may be linked to psychotic symptoms, and dissociation predicts not only voice hearing, but other forms of hallucinations and delusions as well. Strongly linked to dissociation are the so-called first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly passivity experiences such as believing that one’s thoughts, feelings, or actions are not under one’s own control. Traumatic, dissociation and, to a lesser extent, attachment-based explanations for psychotic symptoms are proposed. It is argued that psychotic symptoms are substantially overemphasized in the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, leading to a high likelihood of misdiagnosing dissociative disorders as schizophrenia, with the accompanying risks of stigma and inappropriate forms of treatment. This is particularly concerning as there is anecdotal evidence that antipsychotic medications are even less effective and more dangerous for dissociative disorders than for psychotic disorders, while trauma and dissociation-based treatments have demonstrated efficacy for psychotic symptoms. Thus, the traumatic and dissociative nature of some, if not most, psychotic symptoms should, for theoretical, clinical and ethical reasons, finally be acknowledged.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Functions of Emotions and Their Role in Psychopathology Observations of children with psychopathology make it clear that emotions are important in the difficulties they suffer. Childhood psychopathology is generally divided into two classes, externalizing and internalizing disorders. A child with an externalizing disorder, such as conduct disorder, is aggressive and destructive apparently without adequate provocation. He (boys show much higher rates of conduct disorder than girls) will react to other children’s playful or friendly overtures with hostility. He steals from his parents without regard to their feelings. He taunts and teases until his sibling starts to cry. Such behaviors have an emotional quality. He seems to be angry with the world and he maintains a mode of retaliation. A child with an internalizing disorder behaves differently. She (girls have a somewhat higher prevalence of internalizing disorders than boys) may withdraw from many situations because they make her feel frightened. She often feels lonely, and feels that others do not like her. Her mood is often low and she is unlikely to initiate activities with peers.",

Findings: Pain may be associated with anxious arousal or with muscle tension but psychological evidence does not relate anxiety to the amount of muscle tension. Psychological illness is common in cases of severe chronic pain but is often only temporary and does not explain persistent pain. Psychological changes commonly follow chronic pain from physical illness. Patients with fibromyalgia often are free from psychological illness, although they show more than patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A close relationship between stress and muscle pain has not been shown. Conclusions: Chronic muscular pain is not a life stress syndrome and has to be understood in terms of organic disorders made worse by psychological factors. psychological change which occurs in consequence of muscle pain needs appropriate psychiatric treatment.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decades, numerous findings have shown that exposure to stress or trauma during the critical period of early development can elicit adverse impacts on the psychological processes and physiological functioning of the body. Precisely, early life stress is associated with a greater risk of developing mental disorders or physical conditions later in life. Accordingly, early life adversity may alter children’s regulation of secretion of neurobiological substrates, as well as influence the sensitivity of their response to stimuli such as stressors. Children who encountered a traumatic event, such as natural disasters, sexual or physical abuse, may develop Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which may in turn disturbed the development of HPA axis and other neuroendocrinal systems which regulate the body’s response to stressors. However, the degree and manner of which childhood stress impacts the regulation of the HPA axis remain unclear and conflicted. Several studies have reported that abused children demonstrated substantially higher morning cortisol levels, which is regulated by the HPA axis, than non abused children. Other studies, however, have shown contradicting results Keywords: Adolescent, childhood trauma, corticotropins, cortisol, HPA axis regulation, post-traumatic stress disorder.",

Internal migration means displacement within the borders of the country. Emigration means leaving the regions they belong to for certain reasons.

As a result of this move, immigrant individuals are affected by spiritual and emotional changes. The psychological effects of immigration on immigrants are known. Immigrant individuals may experience difficulties in three different categories: before migration, during migration and after migration. As a result of research on common pathologies seen in immigrants, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, self-alienation, schizophrenia, somatization disorder, and increased psychotic features have been expressed. It is known that the life disruption of immigrants has also been reduced. There are definitions of these immigrant types, as well as the psychological transitions of immigrant individuals and the common problem seen in immigrants.

This is especially so in developing countries (including Beijing and Shanghai in China), where typically less than 10% of people with mood disorders will ever receive any form of professional treatment.4\r\n\r\nThe epidemiological meaning of a “case” of depression (such as mild major depressive episode) may have little to do with whether the affected person needs psychiatric evaluation or drug treatment, or both. This is not unlike increasingly lenient public health definitions of physical conditions such as obesity or serum cholesterol concentrations in the general population. In the spirit of early intervention, psychosocial intervention or a change in lifestyle may work better than drugs in alleviating such mild metabolic disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe real problem for the increasing diagnosis of depression is the poor access to quality psychosocial interventions such as cognitive therapy not only in developing countries but also in much of the developed West. This is despite a strong base of evidence showing that such interventions are at least as effective as drugs in treating and preventing depression. In many parts of the world clinical psychology does not exist.",

      "abstract": "Tourette Syndrome (TS) is more than having motor and vocal tics, and this review will examine the varied co-morbidities as well as the social impact and Quality of Life (QoL) in individuals with TS. The relationship between any individual and his/her environment is complex and this is further exaggerated in the case of a person with TS. For example, tics may play a significant role in shaping the person's experiences, perceptions and interactions with the environment. Further, associated clinical features, co-morbidities and co-existing psychopathologies may compound or alter this relationship. The common co-morbidities in this regard include Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and disruptive behaviours, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and co-existent problems include anxiety, depression and low self esteem, which can all lead to poorer psychosocial functioning and QoL. Thus, the symptoms of TS and the associated co-morbid conditions may interact to result in a vicious cycle or a downward spiralling of negative experiences and poor QoL. The stigma and social maladjustment in TS and the social exclusion, bullying and discrimination is considered to be caused in large part by misperceptions of the disorder by teachers, peers, and the wider community. Improved community and professional awareness about TS and related co-morbidities & other psychopathologies as well as the provision of multidisciplinary services to meet the complex needs of this clinical population are critical. Future research to inform the risk and resilience factors for successful long term outcomes is also warranted.",

      "abstract": "There has been a worrying trend in Kashmir i.e. the growth of posttraumatic stress disorder, a mental condition which is affecting people for more than two decades. The continuous political uncertainty, insecurity from armed forces; natural calamities are the contributory factors. And it is found that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is on the rise in Kashmir Valley after the worst ever floods hit the state few months back. Psychiatrists in Srinagar opine that there has been a remarkable increase in the number of patients who were suffering from “early symptoms” of PTSD. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a condition that develops after an individual expose through a terrifying ordeal that involves physical harm or the threat of a physical harm. The condition develops amongst the people who may have gone through some physical harm or might have witnessed their loved ones or the people around them being harmed. The trauma affects people in three ways: negative, neutral and positive. Under the positive category, the affected person somehow gets encouraged and takes up challenges. Their condition does not make any difference to them. Highly stressful events or major life traumas (such as serious illness, road traffic accident, death of a relative or loved one, unemployment, divorce, etc.) can lead to a variety of behavioral, psychological and emotional negative outcomes to the disruptive and aversive conditions (Taku, Cann, Tedeschi, &amp; Calhoun, 2009). The positive side of the trauma is that it also leads to growth. This phenomenon has been recognized as a distinct construct – posttraumatic growth (Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 1996), implying ‘‘positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances’’ (Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004, p. 1). Positive change has been noted in the literature by various authors and referred to in diverse terms – among others, benefit-finding (Affleck &amp; Tennen, 1996), stress-related growth (Park, Cohen, &amp; Murch, 1996), adversarial growth (Linley &amp; Joseph, 2004), flourishing (Ryff &amp; Singer, 1998), and thriving (O’Leary &amp; Ickovics, 1995). The main objective of the paper is to discuss the role of Islam with special reference to Qur’an and Sunna in posttraumatic Growth among violence victims in Kashmir valley India. Islamic practices such as prayer and listening Qur’an plays important role in coping with traumatic disorders. Islamic values and beliefs can be beneficial in overcoming traumatic life events and seeking posttraumatic Growth. The Holy Qur’an teaches us “The truly righteous — are those who endure with fortitude misfortune, hardship and peril. That is, who are patient in poverty and affliction, and in time of war” (2:178).",

      "abstract": "As a period of transition from childhood to early adulthood, adolescence is often a difficult time. Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by feelings of sadness, unhappiness, hopelessness, and even guilt. depression in adolescents is often seen through other symptoms, which look different from the symptoms of depression in adults. When a teenager is depressed, he will show changes in attitude and behavior. Depression in adolescents can occur due to various things, the influence of social media, concerns about posture that are not ideal, or because of decreased academic problems. Often times, teens whose feelings are hurt look for substances or alcohol to make themselves feel better. The more the teenager uses substances to treat depression, the more likely he is to become addicted. That is why parents should be vigilant about children's mental health as well as their physical health. One of the psychological problems with internet addiction that causes depression can be caused by the reduced time spent with friends and family which leads to social isolation. This condition can lead to depression. Because depression in adolescents is often a chronic and sometimes relapsing disease that predicts an increased risk of depression in the adult years and because comorbid substance use disorders can increase the severity of depression. Because comorbid substance use disorders can increase the severity of depression, treatment for depression should always include both the acute and advanced phases. ABSTRAKSebagai periode transisi dari masa anak-anak hingga masa awal dewasa, masa remaja tidak jarang menjadi waktu yang sulit. Depresi adalah gangguan kesehatan mental yang ditandai dengan perasaan sedih, tidak bahagia, putus asa, dan bahkan bersalah. Depresi pada remaja seringkali terlihat melalui gejala lain, yang terlihat berbeda dari gejala depresi orang dewasa. Ketika remaja mengalami depresi, ia akan memperlihatkan perubahan sikap dan perilaku. Depresi pada remaja dapat terjadi karena berbagai hal, pengaruh media sosial, kekhawatiran dengan postur tubuh yang tidak ideal, atau karena masalah akademis yang menurun. Seringkali, remaja yang perasaannya terluka mencari zat atau alkohol untuk membuat diri mereka merasa lebih baik. Semakin banyak remaja menggunakan zat untuk mengobati depresi, semakin besar kemungkinan dia menjadi kecanduan. Itulah mengapa orang tua harus waspada tentang kesehatan mental anak seperti kesehatan fisik mereka. Salah satu masalah psikologis pada kecanduan internet yang menimbulkan depresi dapat disebabkan karena berkurangnya waktu bersama teman dan keluarga yang menyebabkan isolasi sosial. Kondisi inilah yang dapat mengarah pada depresi. Karena depresi pada remaja seringkali merupakan penyakit kronis dan kadang kambuh yang memprediksi peningkatan risiko depresi pada tahun-tahun dewasa dan karena komorbiditas gangguan penggunaan zat dapat meningkatkan keparahan depresi. Karena komorbiditas gangguan penggunaan zat dapat meningkatkan keparahan depresi, maka pengobatan depresi harus selalu mencakup fase akut dan lanjutan.",

These problems are not specific to psychiatry but they are more obvious and more complex than many of those met elsewhere in medicine, largely because the most characteristic symptoms are subjective; known only because a person describes them. Observable signs do exist, such as autonomic arousal in someone describing a subjective feeling of anxiety, or evidence of concomitant activity in the cortex while describing auditory hallucinations. But the reported experience is often the only evidence available. The first and most basic problem, therefore, is to decide whether a symptom is present or absent. The second problem, an extension of the first, is to assess clinical severity.",

Although definitions may vary, the term usually refers to an experience or event, that causes distress on the person, to the point that it impacts their ability to cope and function, and can also cause intense psychological and emotional reactions, affecting their wellbeing (APA,2013). Trauma, including one-time events, but not limited to, not only leaves long lasting and repetitive effects on the survivor, but also affects everyone differently. According to the nature and type of trauma, and how it correlates with the personality of the individual who has experienced it, the way those effects manifest can be obvious, and can clearly impact cognitive functioning, in a way that we can clearly measure and diagnose it as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, trauma, might also be subtle and quiet, in cases where the symptoms do not specifically fall under the diagnostic criteria checklist, since these effects might be insidious, can be easily overlooked and, in turn, become destructive for the individual experiencing them (SAMHSA, 2014). The immediate reactions following the traumatic event are usually quite complicated and are shaped by the survivors’ personal experiences, their ability to.",

These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness.

      "title": "Management of Painful Physical Symptoms Associated With Depression and Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a common, recurring illness that continues to be underdiagnosed and undertreated in both psychiatric and primary care settings. It is increasingly being recognized that painful physical symptoms, which commonly exist comorbid with depressive disorders, play a role in complicating diagnosis of depression. Patients tend to discuss physical pain with primary care physicians and emotional pain with psychiatrists, often oblivious to the fact that both may be aspects of one disorder. Those who present with somatic complaints are three times less likely to be accurately diagnosed than patients with psychosocial complaints. However, thorough evaluation of mood and anxiety disorders in primary care is sparse due to the limited time primary care physicians can spend with each patient. Better recognition and treatment of both physical and emotional symptoms associated with mood disorders may increase a patient's chance of achieving remission, which is the optimum therapeutic goal. Abnormalities of serotonin and noradrenaline are strongly associated with depression and are thought to play a role in pain perception. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is increased with antidepressant treatment, appears to influence regulation of mood and perception of pain. Clinical evidence indicates that dual-acting agents may have an advantage in modulating pain over those agents that increase either serotonin or noradrenaline alone. The novel dual-acting agents, such as venlafaxine and duloxetine, are better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. These agents have demonstrated efficacy in depression and in diabetic neuropathic pain independently. Therefore, unless otherwise stated, all inferences to studies of pain in this monograph refer to neuropathic pain in nondepressed patients.",

      "abstract": "We analyze burnout phenomenon. In the works of Russian and foreign scientists, the phenomenon of “burnout” is studied as “medical” and “psychological” issue and is considered in terms of its causes, symptomatology and functional peculiarities. The key factor of burnout is a prolonged stay in unfavorable conditions of the social environment, the reason may be stressful mental states and an existential crisis caused by a mismatch of ideological values and expectations with reality. Burnout has a cumulative effect and is interpreted as a consequence of permanent stress in the workplace and activities outside the profession. The signs of emotional burnout are interpreted in connection with the social characteristics of the activity because they arise as a result of non-constructive communication which is traumatic for the psyche in a wide range of life activities. The clinical nature of emotional burnout is diagnosed at the theoretical and empirical levels. Emotional burnout has the status of a syndrome – a pathological state of the psyche with certain symptoms. The symptoms of emotional burnout are considered relying on experimental research devoted to distinctive features of the stress among students and educators in Russian higher educational institutions. The psychological theory of adaptation characterizes the phenomenon of emotional burnout as a vital function of psychological protection, which serves to stimulate the psyche in the process of resistance to the effects of stress.",

The Supreme Court of Korea has sometimes tried to take into account of mental and emotional injuries in determining whether the defendant has imposed `bodily injuries` on the victim. However, it still hesitates to announce that mental injury is a part of bodily injuries. To the contrary, the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines state that: “bodily injury” means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. Impairment of a function of mental faculty will be counted on finding criminal liability under the guidelines. Too many victims are suffering from mental and emotional injuries after the criminal accident. Typical symptoms are including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder but the victims are not qualified for the compensation from the government. Furthermore, the criminal courts do not care about what has visibly happened on the brains of criminal victims. They are often ignoring recent developments in the neuro-science, which clearly shows that mental defects are resulted from the criminal act on the victims. We need to re-define what is injury. Imposing mental illness on victim must be punished on a charge of injuring. It will help the criminal victims recover from the post-traumatic symptoms and get back to their daily lifes.",

      "title": "Is Multiple Sclerosis Patient Depressed, Stressed, or Both? How to Sort through Overlapping Symptoms and Provide Appropriate Treatment",
      "abstract": "Mrs. S, age 50, has had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) for approximately 10 years. She describes her mood as up and down and is referred by her neurologist for psychiatric assessment of mood swings and possible depression. Fatigue limits her ability to work full-time, perform household duties, socialize with friends and family, and enjoy mental or physical exercise. In addition, her 18-year-old daughter--an important source of psychological support--is planning to leave home. Mrs. S experienced depression 5 years ago during her divorce. She was prescribed paroxetine, 20 mg/d, and had a positive response. She took the medication for 6 months, then discontinued. One-half of MS patients experience major depression in their lifetimes, (1) and the suicide rate is approximately doubled in MS patients compared with the general population. (2) Depression in MS patients often has an atypical presentation, with irritability and anger being as prominent as sadness. (3) Not all emotional changes experienced by MS patients represent depressive disorders, however. When evaluating MS patients who are struggling with depression, you can help them by diagnosing comorbid mood disorders, determining suicide risk, and providing psychological support as they cope with the impact of their illness. MS disease course MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, characterized by: * inflammatory demyelination and gliosis * neuronal and axonal loss * a variety of presenting symptoms as different CNS regions are affected. Focal areas of demyelination followed by a reactive gliosis cause white matter lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Neurologic dysfunction can manifest as visual changes, spastic paresis, hypoesthesia and paresthesia, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. MS presentation also can include optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. MS symptoms often are intensified by heat exposure. After the initial episode, months or years may pass before additional neurologic symptoms appear. Based on its course, MS can be classified as: * relapsing-remitting, when the disease does not progress between attacks * secondary progressive, characterized by a gradually progressive course after an initial relapsing-remitting pattern * primary progressive, when patients experience gradual progressive disability from symptom onset (Table 1, page 80). CASE CONTINUED Progressing symptoms Mrs. S has had multiple MS presentations, including optic neuritis, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, and urinary incontinence. Recently, her MS symptoms have gradually progressed even in the absence of attacks, and her diagnosis has been revised to secondary progressive MS. During psychiatric evaluation, Mrs. S denies persistent changes in sleep or appetite. She describes fatigue that starts after physical exertion and increases as the day progresses. She denies feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation and does not have a history of inappropriate anger or irritability. Diagnosing depression in MS Normal emotional adjustment to MS can include reactions to loss of function or changes in social or occupational roles. Further, MS patients--similar to non-MS patients--experience life changes and transitions not related to the illness, such as divorce or a grown child moving away. Emotional responses to life stressors often are self-limited but may warrant an adjustment disorder diagnosis if they are associated with excessive distress or substantial impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning (Table 2, page 82). (4) Female MS patients and those who report high stress or a family history of affective disorder may be more likely to develop clinical depression. (5) Several studies have reported correlations between structural brain abnormalities and depression in MS. …",

      "abstract": "The importance of depression as a psychopathologic syndrome in the elderly is stressed by the estimate that about 30 percent of persons over the age of 65 may be expected to experience an episode of depression severe enough to interfere with daily functioning. Depression is the chief cause of psychiatric hospitalization among the elderly, and it bears great potential for death through inanition or suicide. Loss of mastery (ability to cope) and the onset of helplessness are frequent dynamic issues in the development of depression or behavioral problems in the elderly. Geriatric stereotypes contribute directly to helplessness by reinforcing such behavior. Stereotypes also minimize the chance of appropriate response outcomes relative to needs. Rolelessness, a partial result of stereotyping, leads to anomie, alienation, and lowered self-esteem. These issues are discussed and points of interaction among them are examined. The relevance to psychotherapy with older persons is outlined.",

Answering ‘yes’ may indicate that you are just experiencing normal concern about the usual tribulations oflife. Alternatively, your worrying may be an indicator that you have a mental disorder. Establishing whether worrying is a symptom of a psychiatric disorder, or merely a normal experience, requires answers to a number of supplementary questions such as ‘What’s it like when you worry?’ ‘Can you turn your attention to anything else?’ and ‘How much of the time over the past month have you worried?’ When worrying becomes a recurrent and painful round of thoughts, so that it is difficult to turn your attention to anything else and takes up much of your time, then your worrying is more likely to be a symptom of a mental disorder (Wing et al. 1974).",

On the other hand, depression can also be described as a quantifiable diseased state of the brain that may be cured using a biological therapy or pharmaceutical. Neither one of these definitions is incorrect; rather, they each describe different aspects of this form of mental illness. This duality inherent to understanding depression makes light of the sparse assemblage of literature that exists concerning such a socially, psychologically, and biologically complex phenomenon. Research has shown that the therapeutic benefits of exercise offer treatment for both the psychosocial and biological effects of depression. A more unified research perspective that looks for a coincidence of the social with the biological may allow for steps forward in understanding mental illness and disease.",

Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

Less effective (or even destructive) treatments have been seized upon, in part because they do not require understanding patients. Understanding them means facing facts about ourselves, our families, and our society that we do not want to know, or, in the case of repressed feelings and experiences, do not want to know again. This reluctance to understand is particularly tragic in the case of the acutely disturbed college student, whose crisis may lead either to reorganization at a higher level of functioning and growth or to a wasted life. The central role of terror in producing symptoms and the genesis and handling of symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations, are briefly discussed.",

While exposure rates for trauma are high for adolescents, the prevalence rates for trauma disorders such as PTSD are relatively low at approximately 6%. Evidence‐based treatments such as cognitive–behavioral therapy have been found to be effective for trauma disorders.

      "abstract": "Social phobia, also known as social anxiety disorder, is characterized by intense fear or anxiety in social situations where individuals fear being scrutinized by others. This condition can lead to significant impairment in various aspects of life, including social and occupational functioning. A subtype, Generalized Social Phobia (GSP), involves a more pervasive fear of social situations and is associated with greater distress and functional impairment. Social phobia often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders such as major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and avoidant personality disorder (APD). APD shares several features with social phobia, including the fear of rejection and criticism, but presents with broader and often more severe symptoms. Effective treatment for social phobia includes cognitive restructuring techniques, exposure therapy, and social skills training (SST). Exposure therapy helps patients confront and reduce their fears by gradually exposing them to anxiety-provoking situations, while SST addresses performance deficits and cognitive distortions. Additionally, mindfulness-based therapies, such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Behavior Therapy (MBBT), have been shown to reduce distress and improve mental health outcomes in individuals with social phobia and related disorders. Diagnosis and treatment require a focus on the individual's specific symptoms, comorbid conditions, and the level of functional impairment. By employing a structured and individualized approach, incorporating exposure exercises, mindfulness practices, and social skills training, clinicians can significantly enhance treatment outcomes, helping individuals with social phobia manage their symptoms and lead more fulfilling lives.",

      "title": "Mental health of adolescents with type I diabetes: A case report",
      "abstract": "Type I Diabetes Mellitus (DM I) is the third most common chronic childhood disease and can cause both short-term and long-term complications, as well as acute life-threatening events. The announcement of the DM I diagnosis in childhood or adolescence constitutes a major psychosocial stressor for the child and his family. Diabetes in general complicates the parent-child relationship and increases adolescents’ negative thoughts about themselves and depressive mood. The majority of patients experience depressive and/or anxiety symptoms at the time of diagnosis, which generally resolve within six to nine months. Poor adjustment in this initial phase places adolescents at risk for later psychosocial difficulties. On a long-term basis, individuals with DM I may exhibit significant psychiatric and behavioral problems including depression, anxiety and anger. We here reported the case of a 13-year-old boy, suffering from DM I for 3 years, who developed poor metabolic control, depressive symptoms and life-threatening behavior in the past 6 months and was hospitalized at an inpatient psychiatric unit. The complex biopsychosocial needs of adolescents with Type I Diabetes Mellitus should be recognized and addressed through tailored interventions by medical and mental health professionals.",

      "title": "Psychotic symptoms in social anxiety disorder patients: report of three cases",
      "abstract": "Background: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is mainly characterized by an individual's intense concern about other people's opinion of the individual.Notably, among those with severe anxious symptoms, we can often observe self-referential feelings.Objective: Faced with little research directed toward the exploration of psychotic symptoms in SAD patients, we will approach the topic by describing three cases.Discussion: Three explanations seem possible for the psychotic manifestations in SAD.The first one depends on the individual's ability or inability to challenge the impression of being criticized by people.A second possibility would be the stressor and perpetuating role of SAD, which would make individuals more likely to present with more severe mental disorders such as delusional disorder (DD).The third explanation would be the possibility that SA is caused by a primary thought abnormality (psychotic self-reference) in some cases, instead of an affective disturbance (anxious insecurity), which led to intense concern about others' opinions.We also observed that antipsychotics did not produce significant improvement in any of the three cases.This result may be related to dopaminergic circuits and the D2 receptor hypoactivity. Conclusion:The differentiation between delusion and anxious concern may be inaccurate and may change throughout the disorder's evolution.New diagnostic subcategories or the enlargement of the social anxiety diagnostic is proposed to overcome the current diagnostic imprecision.There seems to be a symptomatic spectrum between SAD and DDs.",

Despite providing some insight into the effects of stress and emotion on memory development with otherwise typically developing children, the question addressed in this chapter is whether childhood trauma, especially that associated with the more prolonged and severe stress of maltreatment, alters the normal course of memory development. It begins with a discussion of the neurobiological consequences of severe and chronic stress on mechanisms related to memory and its development.",

Un mois plus tard, lorsque ces signes ont disparu, un protocole de stress chroniques legers (SCL), qui par lui-meme engendre des effets plus modeste, est applique pendant 3 semaines. Cinq jours apres sa fin, les animaux sont sacrifies. Deux populations sont identifiees. L'une, non sensibilisee, presente des signes anxio-depressifs de faible amplitude, equivalents a ceux observes apres le SCL seul. L'autre population, sensibilisee par le premier stress, presente un profil de type depressif, les animaux sont alors qualifies de repondeurs.

      "title": "Poor insight in psychosis and meta-representation models",
      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

      "title": "SPL12 HEAVY PHYSICAL WORK AND FATIGUE IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS",
      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

      "abstract": "This paper does not attempt to review the whole topic of clinical efficacy but will consider general concepts, particularly in the light of the advent of the serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The aetiology of depression is complex. In most cases there is some form of predisposition based on problematical family dynamics, disordered family communication and/or genetic factors; each may be present to a variable extent. On top of this predisposition, some form of stimulus - ‘stress’, an external problem, loss of control, a physical disorder, adverse life circumstances - appears to affect those who are already primed. There are a variety of possible outcomes from this combination of predisposition and stimuli: low mood, depression in the full syndromic sense, and depression with biological features. It seems likely that, particularly with severe depressions (the major syndromic forms and those with biological features), there are neuroendocrine and neurochemical changes to mediate the effects of stress into those of the clinical symptoms and signs. It has been hypothesised that stressors induce adaptive neurochemical changes, failure of which may engender behavioural disturbances (Anisman &amp; Zacharko, 1992). However, there are also many individuals who may not undergo this process, but who probably have some cognitive or learned change leading to dysphoria; this aspect needs to be considered carefully in relation to efficacy.",

      "title": "Are depressive residual symptoms independent of treatments?",
      "abstract": "Residual symptoms occur in many depressive patients after acute treatment [1]. There is growing evidence that residual symptoms are also prevalent in bipolar disorder during the euthymic phase and in unipolar depression, they are predictors of early relapse [2,3]. In long-term outcome, patients remitting from depression with residual symptoms, have more depressive symptoms and impaired social functioning, thus needing more aggressive treatment [4]. Residual symptoms might be conceived as the persistence of the original mood disorder, despite in a milder presentation, or still be in relation to the neurobiological disorder substrate. Residual symptoms include core mood and functional symptoms of depression. The most common residual symptoms are sleep disturbances, fatigue, and disinterest. The clinician should be aware that patients despite being in apparent remission should be questioned thoroughly in order to identify residual cognitive difficulties, impairment of work and activities, psychic anxiety, sleep disturbances or mild depressive mood [5]. The consequences of low-quality remission impairing psychosocial functioning have to be emphasized. In this presentation we will review the available evidence of the role played by the pharmacological treatments in the residual depressive symptoms.",

Most children manifest the early symptoms and are diagnosed between ages 18 months and 36 months; in many, diagnosis can be suspected as early as 10–12 months of age and in most by 24 months. Autism should be suspected when an infant does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age; does not speak one word by 16 months; does not combine two words by 2 years of age; does not respond to name; and loses language or social skills.

      "abstract": "Abstract Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is now constituted by a set of characteristic symptoms, its roots lie in Post-Vietnam Syndrome, a label generated by a Vietnam-era advocacy movement that focused not on symptoms but on war’s traumatic context. When Post-Vietnam Syndrome was subsumed into the abstract, individualistic, symptom-centered language of DSM-III and rendered as PTSD, it not only lost this focus on context but also neglected the experiences of veterans who suffer from things done or witnessed, not primarily from what was done to them, in war. This agent-related trauma has been rediscovered in contemporary work on moral injury, but moral injury too is increasingly subjected to the hegemony of the symptom. Focusing on symptoms, however, unhelpfully pathologizes and individualizes trauma, neglects traumatic context, and legitimates problematic therapeutic approaches. Trauma researchers and clinicians should decenter the language of symptoms and focus instead on context and on alternative accounts of trauma.",

The quality of life and health is\r\n impaired. The person is no longer the same as before or before the trauma. It best recognizes and\r\n finds his family suffering the most. Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs. Family members do not know how and how to help. There is\r\n a need to react in time and seek professional help. Successful treatment is very important for\r\n good communication that needs to be established with the patient and that his family is involved\r\n with the patient as well, because it should be the greatest support and support, and this can\r\n greatly affect the course and outcome of the treatment.

      "abstract": "BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES BRUCE GREYSON* Near-death experiences (NDEs) are profound psychological events with transcendental or mystical elements typically occurring to individuals close to death or in situations of intense physical or emotional danger. Such experiences, once regarded as meaningless hallucinations, have become the subject of serious study by medical and other researchers in recent years. Near-death experiences are important to physicians not only because they may occur to patients while under our care, but because they often lead to profound aftereffects that may affect health and response to medical treatments, and because they may help us understand the interaction between mind and body, particularly as that interface is affected by the dying process. Once thought to be rare, the NDE is estimated to occur to a third of people who come close to death, or about 5 percent of the American population [1-3]. Although the term \"near-death experience\" and its acronym were not coined until 1975, accounts of similar events can be found in the folklore and writings of European, Middle Eastern, African, Indian, East Asian, Pacific, and Native American cultures. The phenomenon was first described as a clinical syndrome in 1892, when Heim published a collection of cases of mountain climbers who had fallen in the Alps (as he himself had done) , soldiers wounded in war, workers who had fallen from scaffolds, and individuals who had nearly died in accidents and near-drownings; this article was translated into English 80 years later [4, 5] . The term \"near-death experience\" was coined by Moody to denote \"any conscious perceptual experience which takes place during ... an event in which a person could very easily die or be killed (and may even be so close as to be believed or pronounced clinically dead) but nonetheless survives, and continues physical life\" [6] . More recently, Moody has redefined neardeath experiences as \"profound spiritual events that happen, uninvited, to *Box 152, Health Sciences Center, University ofVirginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908; email: cbg4d@virginia.edu.© 1998 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved. 0031-5982/98/4201-1079$01.00 14 Bruce Greyson ¦ Biological Aspects of Near-Death Experiences some individuals at the point ofdeath' ' [7] . TheDictionary ofModern Medicine has offered a more specific definition ofthe near-death experience: A phenomenon of unclear nature that may occur in patients who have been clinically dead and then resuscitated; the patients report a continuity ofsubjective experience , remembering visitors and other hospital events despite virtually complete suppression of cortical activity; near-death experiences are considered curiosities with no valid explanation in the context of an acceptable biomedical paradigm; the trivial synonym, Lazarus complex, refers to the biblical Lazarus who was raised from the dead by Jesus of Nazareth [8]. Predisposing Factors Near-death experiences are reported by individuals who had been pronounced clinically dead but then resuscitated, by individuals who actually died but were able to describe their experiences in their final moments (\"deathbed visions\"), and by individuals who, in the course of accidents or illnesses, feared that they were near death. Researchers have identified very few personal traits or variables that can predict who will have an NDE, or what kind of NDE a person may have. Retrospective studies of near-death experiencers have shown them collectively to be psychologically healthy individuals, who do not differ from control groups in age, gender, race, religion, religiosity, or mental health [2, 912 ]. Locke and Shontz found NDErs to be indistinguishable from control subjects in intelligence, neuroticism, extroversion, trait and state anxiety, and relevant Rorschach measures [13]. However, some studies have suggested that NDErs tend to be good hypnotic subjects, remember their dreams more often, and are adept at using mental imagery, and tend to acknowledge significant childhood trauma and resultant dissociative tendencies [11, 14, 15]. It is not clear, however, whether these personal traits and recall of prior experiences are the results of having had an NDE, or whether people who already have those characteristics are more prone to have NDEs when they come close to death. Children's NDEs are similar to those of adults, except that they tend not to include a life review or meetings with deceased friends and relatives...",

Depression is a state of mental disorder characterized by three main symptoms and seven additional symptoms. Diabetes Mellitus Type-1 (T1DM) is a systemic disorder caused by impaired glucose metabolism, which is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. Depression is common in patients with T1DM. In this case report, a 13-year-old girl was consulted because she looks sad. A feeling of sadness has been felt for 3 months and has been getting worse since a week ago, which was initially because of T1DM. Patients usually work at home and carry out daily activities as usual. Currently, the patient has no desire and gets tired easily, especially when doing usual activities, thinking the pain will get worse and thinking that she can't recover. Complaints are felt throughout the day and worsen at night, especially before bed or when alone. The patient feels that she is useless and his future is bleak. During pregnancy, the patient's mother routinely checks with the midwife and gets complete immunizations. The patient was born vaginally and cried spontaneously. The patient also received complete basic immunization.",

Most sufferers are not diagnosed however, even after visiting a healthcare professional. Social anxiety disorder need not be a difficult condition to diagnose. Characteristic features of the disorder include blushing as the principal symptom and an early age of onset. Social anxiety disorder is also easily distinguished from other anxiety disorders by the situations in which patients experience fear and avoidance; for the patient with social anxiety disorder, these situations always involve social interaction or scrutiny by other people. The consequences of untreated social anxiety disorder include social isolation, impaired educational attainment and career progression, depression, and alcohol abuse. Rating scales such as the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) give a consistent measure of severity of social anxiety disorder and so help physicians assess their patients' need for treatment and their improvement. Social anxiety disorder is an eminently treatable condition, as demonstrated by treatment-induced reduction in LSAS scores in clinical trials and by individual case histories. Appropriate therapy can give patients relief from their distressing and disabling symptoms and allows them to make substantial improvements to their quality of life.",

As a consequence there is a sharp inhibition of conditioned and, in part, of unconditioned reflexes. Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction. This confirms the presence of cortical inhibition in an arbitrarily induced condition of age or fatigue. If the subject regards himself as being of a younger age or in a more vigorous situation than usual, this will induce a certain increase in the reflexes.",

Indications for developmental evaluation include no babbling, pointing, or use of other gestures by 12 months of age, no single words by 16 months of age, no two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months of age, and loss of previously learned language or social skills at any age. The differential diagnosis includes other psychiatric and pervasive developmental disorders, deafness, and profound hearing loss. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Common comorbidities include mental retardation, seizure disorder, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Behavior modification programs are helpful and are usually administered by multidisciplinary teams, targeted medication is used to address behavior concerns.

      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

      "title": "Psychological Factors and Heart Disease",
      "abstract": "A number of studies have revealed that perceived emotional stress can produce various transient cardiovascular responses. The reactions may include changes in heart rate and cardiac output. They may include abnormalities in heart rhythm, changes in blood pressure, peripheral resistance, blood viscosity, blood clotting time, and serum cholesterol levels. A hypothesis suggested by the findings which requires further research follows: If these cardiovascular responses were sustained for a period of time, they would ultimately influence the onset or course of coronary artery disease. These studies also suggest that emotional tension at one's work may place an additional strain on an already diseased heart. In patients whose cardiovascular system is already impaired, investigators have traced the sequence from emotional upset to heart disease. Since the reported evidence has been based on cardiac subjects, it is still possible that \"gradual increase in tension\" is perceived only after illness occurs, but not necessarily perceived as stressful before beart disease. Owing to the lack of prospective studies in which the life stress factors are studied prior to heart disease, emotion as a cause or contributory factor to heart disease has not been fully accepted. These studies suggest that certain personality traits may be common to certain forms of heart disease. Most of this evidence has been observed from time-consuming, detailed personality analysis, and the evidence depends on studies of relatively few patients and poor or no controls. It is important to note that these studies on personality type and heart disease were conducted after heart disorders developed. This raises the question of whether the reported personality characteristics preceded or followed the heart disease. The investigations to date assume that the personality structure occurred before the appearance of the heart disease, but before we can answer this question, a longitudinal study of the personality of individuals prior to cardiovascular disease would be necessary.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

These disorders are highly prevalent: Roughly half the population meets criteria for one or more such disorders in their lifetimes, and roughly one fourth of the population meets criteria in any given year. Most people with a history of mental disorder had first onsets in childhood or adolescence. Later onsets typically involve comorbid disorders. Some anxiety disorders (phobias, separation anxiety disorder) and impulse-control disorders have the earliest age of onset distributions. Other anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder), mood disorders, and substance disorders typically have later ages of onset. Given that most seriously impairing and persistent adult mental disorders are associated with child-adolescent onsets and high comorbidity, increased efforts are needed to study the public health implications of early detection and treatment of initially mild and currently largely untreated child-adolescent disorders.",

      "title": "A bio‐social model for common mental disorders",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT It is argued that two major symptom dimensions underlie common mental disorders. These are depression related symptoms on the one hand, and anxious symptoms on the other. Each of these symptom dimensions is relate to a set of social variables, but an individual patient may have social factors present that are associated with each symptom dimension, thus producing an overlapping of symptoms. Another reason why the symptom dimensions overlap is that depression and anxiety relate to reward and punishment systems respectively, and these systems are necessarily reciprocally related to one another. Finally, each of these systems is related to abnormal activities in both nor‐adrenergic and 5‐hydroxytryptaminergic neurones. It is argued that in order to produce a useful model for common disorders one should distinguish between three groups of factors: those producing vulnerability to anxious or depressive symptoms, those factors releasing symptoms at a particular time, and those factors which determine how long illness lasts. These three groups of factors are respectively called vulnerability, destabilisation and restitution",

An equivalent deficit of expression of the same primary facial emotions in schizophrenics has not been clearly established. Twenty chronic hospitalised schizophrenics and 20 normals were therefore tested on tasks of facial emotional expression upon verbal command, of facial emotional expression imitation, and of non-affective bucco-facial praxic imitation. Results indicate that chronic schizophrenics do manifest a deficit of facial emotion expression which can best be explained by task parameters, such as verbal cueing of emotions, perceptual recognition, and bucco-facial dyspraxia in decreasing order of importance. The deficit does not appear to result from neuroleptic or anticholinergic medication nor length of hospitalisation or disease.",

      "title": "Paradoxical Analgesic and Hyperalgesic Effects of Stress",
      "abstract": "Stress is a mentally or emotionally disruptive condition produced by adverse external influences which affects physical health. It is one of the most common human experiences, and the stress response which involves activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and subsequent behavioral, neurochemical and immunological changes, is key to adapting to a constantly changing environment. The heightened anxiety and arousal accompanying the stress response is generally considered to be motivating rather than debilitating. However, when stress is sustained or perceived as uncontrollable, the biological changes that, short-term, are usually adaptive, can have long-term pathophysiological consequences.Stressors may be physiological and/or psychological, and both types have been utilized to study stress effects on various experiences, including pain. The use of animal models of stress led to the observation of two pain-related phenomena. Following exposure to stressful situations, animals may exhibit antinociception to noxious cutaneous stimuli, a phenomenon known as stress-induced analgesia. It is easy to understand how there would be survival value in suppressing pain so that an animal could react (\"fight or flight\") to a dangerous situation. Interestingly, stress-induced hyperalgesia, which involves enhanced nociceptive responses, often occurs simultaneously. Although it has been less extensively studied in the laboratory than SIA, SIH has been well-documented in the clinic, especially in functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are characterized by visceral hypersensitivity. Stressful life events, particularly early in life, may predispose individuals to or exacerbate symptoms of functional GI disorders.How these two, seemingly paradoxical, phenomena can co-exist is of great interest. SIA and SIH do share some common neurotransmitters (opioids, neurotensin) and supraspinal sites (rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), amygdala). fMRI studies reveal that visceral and cutaneous pain activate a common neural network including somatosensory and parietal cortices, cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia. However, these different stimuli also evoke differential activation patterns in various brain regions. Thus, it is likely that there is not one single pain pathway, but rather separate pathways subserving the phenomena of SIA and SIH. Determining the components of these pathways would enable scientists and clinicians to develop better pain treatments.",

The complexity of testing any knowledge, skill, or ability is increased when the persons assessed have one or several communication disorders. The valid identification and diagnosis of such disorders requires prior understanding of development and communication and, in most instances, also a prior language assessment. Because accidental success in ordinary discourse processing becomes vanishingly unlikely as tasks increase in complexity, successes in discursive tasks are more informative than failures.

It is associated with an increased risk of death, not only through suicide but also from physical illnesses such as cardiovascular disease. It is under-recognized and undertreated and it should be screened for in those at high-risk for depression such as those suffering from chronic physical health problems. Its aetiology is multifactorial and comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders is common. Assessment of depression requires the clinician to determine the duration, symptom severity, suicide risk and functional impairment in the current episode, co-morbid diagnoses, past mood and treatment history, as well as a developmental, social and family history. Treatment is guided by illness severity, presentation and prior history and includes psychosocial interventions, medication and their combination, with antidepressant medication reserved for persistent and moderate-to-severe depression. Prevention of relapse is a priority and risk factors for this should be assessed and used to guide prophylactic drug and psychological treatment.",

      "title": "Functional Neuroanatomy of Emotion and Its Regulation in PTSD",
      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a devastating disorder, linked to profound mental, physical, occupational, and functional impairment. In addition, it is a highly complex disorder, characterized by symptom heterogeneity across multiple domains. Nevertheless, emotion dysregulation arising from the exaggerated response to threat or from the inability to regulate negative emotional states plays a defining role in the pathophysiology of PTSD. In order to improve our understanding of how emotion dysregulation manifests in this illness, functional neuroimaging research over the past 20 years provides great insight into underlying neuroanatomy of each component of emotion dysregulation in the context of PTSD. While prior reviews exist on the topic of neuroimaging findings in PTSD, the present review synthesizes that work through the lens of emotion and its regulation. Studies that employed tasks of emotional responding and symptom provocation, implicit regulation (e.g., emotional Stroop and interference), explicit regulation (e.g., cognitive reappraisal), and fear conditioning/extinction were reviewed. Findings demonstrate that emotion dysregulation in PTSD arises from complications within a large neurocircuitry involving the amygdala, insula, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Although an exaggerated response in the amygdala and insula to negative emotional triggers is pervasive, PTSD is also marked by deficient appraisal, resolution, and management of negative emotional states subserved by the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex during regulation. These findings further support the importance of studying emotion-regulation deficits in tandem with exaggerated symptom provocation in order to better understand the constellation of symptoms present in those with PTSD.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "title": "Developmental Neuroendocrinology of Early-Life Stress: Impact on Child Development and Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Our internal balance, or homeostasis, is threatened or perceived as threatened by stressful stimuli, the stressors. The stress system is a highly conserved system that adjusts homeostasis to the resting state. Through the concurrent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine-autonomic nervous systems, the stress system provides the appropriate physical and behavioral responses, collectively termed as “stress response”, to restore homeostasis. If the stress response is prolonged, excessive or even inadequate, several acute or chronic stress-related pathologic conditions may develop in childhood, adolescence and adult life. On the other hand, earlylife exposure to stressors has been recognized as a major contributing factor underlying the pathogenesis of non-communicable disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders. Accumulating evidence suggests that early-life stress has been associated with an increased risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder in the offspring, although findings are still controversial. Nevertheless, at the molecular level, early-life stressors alter the chemical structure of cytosines located in the regulatory regions of genes, mostly through the addition of methyl groups. These epigenetic modifications result in the suppression of gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. In addition to DNA methylation, several lines of evidence support the role of non-coding RNAs in the evolving field of epigenetics. In this review article, we present the anatomical and functional components of the stress system, discuss the proper, in terms of quality and quantity, stress response, and provide an update on the impact of early-life stress on child development and behavior.",

      "abstract": "Both APA and WHO try to define 'Brief Psychoses' and 'Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder', respectively, by using the time factor (duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day, but less than 1 month) as well as the cultural aspect (a symptom is not included if it is a culturally sanctioned response pattern, see p.) and by the exclusion of the effects of a substance or of general medical conditions. The WHO tries to achieve homogeneity on the one hand by using similar exclusion criteria like those of DSM-IV (time factor, organic cause, etc.), but on the other by defining subgroups (see p. 7ff). The first way, the time factor, however, applied by the WHO is somewhat more complicated than that of the APA. The first time factor used by the WHO concerns the development of symptoms (the time-interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks). And the second factor, the duration of an episode, depends on the type of the subgroup: the total duration of the disorder in the subgroups with schizophrenic symptoms (F23.1: Acute Polymorphic Psychotic Disorders with Symptoms of Schizophrenia, F23.2: Acute Schizophrenia-like Psychotic Disorders) must not exceed 1 month. This is also valid for the unspecified type (F23.8).",

      "title": "Dysphoria from a Transnosological Perspective",
      "abstract": "The objective of our psychopathological analyses is to shed light on the position of irritable mood (dysphoria) in psychiatric diagnostics and nosology. In today's most commonly applied classification systems, the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, dysphoria is mentioned mostly in the context of diagnostic criteria of personality and affective disorders. Other authors have emphasized the importance of dysphoric states in organic psychoses and delusional disorders. Summarizing the various publications on the nosological position, dysphoria is a nosological nonspecific syndrome which may occur in the course of all psychiatric disorders and illnesses. According to the results of our psychopathological analyses, the pathogenesis of dysphoria has to be considered as a multidimensional circular process in which various mental, physical and social factors act as predisposing, triggering and disorder-maintaining factors. Stressors induced by particular experiences and perceptions and by impaired health may lead to a dysphoric state if adequate coping mechanisms are missing. Dysphoria itself usually leads to a deterioration in the mental and physical state of the patient, and shows a clear impact on the patient's social network. The reactions of people close to the patient combined with the impaired mental and physical conditions of the patient cause the circle to restart. As contemporary diagnostic entities do not refer to pathogenesis, classical categorical diagnostics cannot provide the basis for effective pathogenesis-oriented therapy. A change of paradigm in diagnostics from a categorical to a dimensional approach thus becomes necessary. Following a dimensional diagnostic approach based on a dynamic model of vulnerability, a precise differential diagnosis of the complex constellation of conditions and their interactions becomes necessary in order to develop effective treatment strategies. Disorder-maintaining factors determine the treatment of the acute symptomatology, whereas predisposing and triggering factors serve as the basis for the prophylactic treatment.",

Furthermore, depressive syndromes can be caused by somatic illness, degenerative disorders, other organic diseases or certain drugs.

Other systems base ratings by physical findings or diagnosis. Criteria for posttraumatic headache are proposed in the form of a mnemonic: IMPAIRMENT. Intensity, Medication use, Physical signs/symptoms, Adjustment, Incapacitation, Recreation, Miscellaneous activity of daily living, Employment, Number (frequency), Time (duration of attacks). Each are scored from 0 to 2 points. There are three physician modifiers, scored from 0 to -4 points: Motivation for treatment, Overexaggeration or overconcern, Degree of legal interest.

Episodes are typified by an atmosphere of pre-existing tension and employee dissatisfaction with restrictive management practices coupled with inhibited negotiation channels; (iii) a third presentation pattern involves the relabelling of endemic symptoms and the occasional appearance of conversion reactions, which are reinforced by a hypervigilant medical community and exacerbating factors.

Prevalence of bipolar disorder is about 1% in adolescents. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and younger adolescents is a challenge, as symptoms may differ from those typically observed in late adolescence and adulthood. One main area of debate centers around the core mood symptom of pediatric mania. The presence of classic cardinal symptoms of euphoria and/or grandiosity characterized by distinctive developmental expressions is emphasized by one view, while another view stresses the distinctly assaultive and persistent irritability of pediatric mania. The non-episodic, continuous, rapid cycling pattern and the high rate of mixed mania pose additional diagnostic challenge, as clinicians may not be able to rely on the typical presence of mood swings to make the diagnosis. Frequent occurrence of comorbid disorders exhibiting symptom overlap with pediatric mania, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may further complicate the diagnosis. Appreciation of current evidence combined with exercise of good clinical judgment may help clinicians optimally diagnose a substantial number of psychiatrically referred youths who present with a complex and severe symptomatology suggestive of bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Psychosocial therapies in addictive disorders",
      "abstract": "Substance use disorders form a significant part of global disease burden. With the increasing trend of use of psychoactive substances, the detrimental effects associated with it also increases. Individuals with substance use disorders are heterogeneous with respect to a number of clinically important features and domains of functioning. The pathophysiology of these addictive disorders is complex, not always linear and can be described as a complex bio-psycho-social process, coordinated by the neurological, vascular and endocrine systems. Apart from these biological factors psychological, physiological, environmental, and cultural factors are also invariably associated with use of a particular substance, and may have an independent intervening effect on the patient's overall quality of life and long term outcomes. Care of individuals with substance use disorders includes conducting a complete assessment, treating intoxication and withdrawal syndromes when necessary, addressing co-occurring psychiatric and general medical conditions, the achievement of abstinence or reduction in the use and effects of the substance, reduction in the frequency and severity of relapse to substance use, and improvement in psychological and social functioning, developing and implementing an overall treatment plan. Methods of intervention for achieving the above objectives vary from pharmacological to behavioral or psychosocial and from singular specific therapies to a broad array of services within a program. The role of psychosocial interventions has been especially underutilized and under studied in this patient population. Treatment services have been developed to address not only the substance use, but also the range of other problems that often predate, co-occur with, and are caused by these substance use disorders. These issues can include family or social relationships, legal matters, job or vocational concerns, medical conditions, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Identifying the magnitude of these problems and managing them effectively may have a significant impact on the prevention of relapse. The importance of developing best practices and clinical guidelines in this area is therefore essential. The essential concepts underlying the management of addiction and related disorders are adoption of a patient-centered framework for evaluation and treatment. As in other areas of health-care, increasing attention is now being focused on providing evidence-based care for persons with substance use disorders and in this context there has been significant progress in the development and standardization of psychosocial treatments for substance use disorders. Psychosocial treatments are now considered essential components to any comprehensive substance use disorder treatment program. Principles of evidence-based medicine may be followed in both men and women in diagnostic and treatment planning and adoption of common psychosocial management approaches for these disorders. They can be implemented individually or in groups and delivered by a range of health workers. Psychosocial treatments are considered to be the foundation of drug and alcohol treatment, especially for substances where pharmacological treatments have not been sufficiently evaluated. The highlights of this book includes a comprehensive overview of the various psychosocial assessment tools, intervention strategies, the efficacy of a community based approach as well as the use of innovative approaches such as digital technology in formulating an adequate psychosocial management approach. There is a need for research on psychological interventions in special populations such as adolescents, the geriatric population, poly drug misuser, those with medical comorbidities, people with psychiatric comorbidity and other specific groups like LGBT, the tribal population and those with physical impairments. The recent literature regarding the same has been highlighted in this book. Maintaining the ethical frame is paramount in the therapy room and this extends to any intervention research which involves human participants. The chapter on ethics examines the debates and recommendations concerning key ethical issues in research on psychotherapy and various psychosocial interventions. Healthy family interaction and regular treatment follow up with support of family has proved to be the major protective factors of abstinence after treatment. These family based interventions would promote the quality of social support to the individual and it has been documented that social support when supplemented with effective community based interventions is a crucial factor in recovery. These guidelines outline this very model and addresses the importance of training primary health care doctors, NGO staff, volunteers, counselors, college & school teachers, strengthening self-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) in case identification, diagnosis, referral to treatment, providing long term care and rehabilitation services of patients with addiction disorders.. We hope that these guidelines would help in facilitating proper management of patients presenting with various types of substance use disorders and that the information provided will be of interest and may serve as a powerful tool to healthcare professionals.",

If a slight physical anomaly exists, the person's concern is markedly excessive and this preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

      "abstract": "Characteristic symptoms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) are (muscle) weakness, muscle pain, cognitive deficits, neurological abnormalities, but above all post-exertional malaise: a long-lasting increase of symptoms after a minor exertion. In contrast, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is primarily defined by 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥? Since 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥?is not mandatory for the diagnosis ME, and post-exertional malaise and cognitive deficits are not obligatory for the diagnosis CFS, the case criteria for ME and CFS define two distinct, partly overlapping nosological entities. ME and CFS are considered to be enigmatic diseases, qualified by some authors as 鈥渕edically unexplained syndromes鈥?of 鈥渇unctional syndromes鈥? However, specific abnormalities consistently observed over the years and their direct and indirect sequels can plausibly explain characteristic symptoms, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?and pain. Abnormalities established repetitively incorporate immunological aberrations (inflammation, immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction), persistent and/or reactivating infections, gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, a (prolonged) deviant response to exertion and orthostatic stress, circulatory deficits, and neurological abnormalities.This article depicts the 4I hypothesis, an explanatory model for ME (CFS) with a central role for four types of immunological abnormalities: inflammation, (Th2-predominated) immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction. The potential direct sequels of these abnormalities, e.g. increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, (reactivating or chronic) infections, and their possible indirect consequences, e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis hypofunction, and cardiovascular dysregulation, can plausibly explain various distinctive symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?

These generally include intitiation, engagement, and disengagement. They can be distinguished by differences in behaviour, such as distractibility, and by differences in physiological indicators, such as heart rate. Each phase shows developmental progress. The arousal potential and the familiarity of objects and events are important factors in determining attention early in development. Later, cognition becomes a more important factor as children are able to engage in more complex activities that demand more attention. The incompatibility of the state of attention with states of high emotional arousal means that attention can help to regulate emotional state, even in young infants.",

People become more stable with sympathetic listening. The experience of loss and its associated feelings can be faced with acceptance, and even psychotic conditions can evaporate when the ring of isolation is broken. Refugees have a higher risk of mental illness than others, showing depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Because little has been written about refugees from a mental health perspective, professionals working therapeutically with them may not give as much consideration to socio-political and psychosocial influences as to traumatic events experienced by refugees. The feelings of helplessness that some refugees experience can be seen as typical of many situations of trauma. Recent scientific literature, mainly in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has recognized post traumatic stress disorder, both acute and chronic, as a specific clinical entity.",

In the presence of its specific symptoms, it seems inappropriate to omit the diagnosis of AS because the DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia are also met, whether delusions and hallucinations appear early or late in the course of the disease. Recognizing and emphasizing the diagnosis of AS is not only important for clinicians to tailor the therapeutic strategy to the features of patients, but also for the patients and their relatives.",

The second half explores the story behind the diagnostic terminology used in clinical practice today, and describes the recent changes to the addiction section of the major classificatory systems. Addiction is conceptualised as a disorder involving a loss of the normal flexibility of human behaviour, leaving a dehumanised state of compulsive behaviour (‘overwhelming involvement’). It has acquired a variety of terminology over time, much of it inferring moral weakness. Addiction may be associated with psychoactive substances or other pleasurable behaviours and occurs on a spectrum of use and harms, which vary in severity. The term ‘dependence’ may refer to physiological aspects of addiction (tolerance or withdrawal), but is also used to define the severe end of the spectrum. Confusion around this terminology has led to it being removed from the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5).",

      "title": "Phenomenological Psychopathology of Neurodiversity",
      "abstract": "The term “neurodiversity” is commonly used to refer to intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder, which are the neurodevelopmental disorders with the most severe impact on a person”s overall functioning along the life-span. Although a wide interpersonal variability, these conditions are associated with peculiarities in the subjective existential experience and in the psychological insight, with a particular reference to areas of emotionality, spirituality, practical skills, socialization, and psychic suffering. These peculiarities lead to a complex psycho-physical continuous vulnerability, including neurovegetative dystonia, lack of environmental mastery, low coping, difficulties in self-determination, repeated losses, and societal exclusion. Care provision should aim at improving quality of life, by enabling the “neurodiverse” (or “psycho-characterized”) person to pursue a self-development aimed at optimizing the relationship between importance and satisfaction in the most emic areas of life, such as being, belonging, and becoming.",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",
