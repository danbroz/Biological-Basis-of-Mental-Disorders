Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "title": "Treating Catatonia: a Blind Spot of Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Neuroanatomical findings on imaginga. Most consistent finding is ventricular enlargement, especially third and lateral ventriclesb. Selective reduction in size of frontal lobe, basal ganglia, thalamus, and limbic regions, including the hippocampus and medial temporal lobec. Possible decrease in volume of neocortical and deep gray matterd. Sulcal widening, especially frontal and temporal areas e. Some studies indicate small but significant difference inbrain and intracranial volume f. Increased incidence of1) Cavum septum pellucidum 2) Partial callosal agenesis8. Functional neuroimaging a. Hypofrontality (frontal and prefrontal cortex): negativesymptoms and neurocognitive deficits b. Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies implicatefrontal cortex (orbital, dorsolateral, medial), anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, several temporal lobe subregions, and cerebellumc. PET studies: anatomic substrate for visual hallucinations in schizophrenia 1) Inferotemporal cortex is responsible for visual recogni-tion of objects and faces 2) Basal ganglia output (primarily substantia nigra parsreticulata) to inferotemporal cortex with relay in ventral anterior thalamic nucleus-influences visualprocessing and causes altered visual perception (hallucinations) as a result of increased dopaminergic activity in basal ganglia (may also be the mechanism of hallucinations in parkinsonian syndromes sensitive to dopaminergic agents [diffuse Lewy body disease more so than idiopathic Parkinson disease])9. Neuropathology a. Decreased cell density in the dorsomedial nucleus ofthalamus b. Displacement of interneurons in frontal lobe cortex c. Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11. Clinical management (see PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND OTHER TREATMENTS) a. Mainstay treatments: antipsychotics (D2 receptor block-ers [postsynaptic]) b. Treatment1) First line, atypicals (may improve neurocognitiveSchizophrenia Genetics Twin studies: nearly 50% monozygotic, 17% dizygoticChromosomes implicated: 3p, 5q, 6p, 6q, 8p, 10p, 13q, 15q, 18p, 22qTrinucleotide repeat (CAG/CTG) on chromosomes 17 & 18impairment in schizophrenia): risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprasole (Abilify)2) Second line: clozapine (Clozaril), is atypical, expensive, and needs monitoring because of the potential for severe agranulocytosis3) Typicals (may worsen neurocognitive functioning): chlorpromazine (Thorazine), thioridazine (Mellaril), perphenazine (Trilafron), loxapine (Loxitane), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), thiothixene (Navane), haloperidol (Haldol), fluphenazine (Prolixin)c. Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12. Psychosocial intervention strategies a. Emphasis on outpatient treatment b. Partial hospitalization, day treatments, outpatient care c. Family therapy reduces relapse rate d. Self-help organizations e. Cognitive therapy techniques: the goal is to remediatethe abnormal thought processes f. Social skills training: little effect on risk of relapse g.

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder (BPD) according to DSM-5 is the sudden onset of psychotic behavior that lasts less than 1 month followed by complete remission with possible future relapses. It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "abstract": "FOR MANY YEARS several pharmacologically similar drugs—lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25), psilocybin, and mescaline, among others—have been of special scientific interest. In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from a heightening of the apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

During the period of mood disturbance, at least three of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been persistent to a significant degree.1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 2. Decreased need for sleep. 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5. Distractability, i.e. attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli. 6. Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation. 7. Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities which have a high potential for painful consequences, e.g. unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments. Mood disturbance sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relations with others, or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others. At no time during the disturbance have there been delusions or hallucinations for as long as two weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms. Not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophrenic form disorder, or delusional disorder or psychotic disorder.

Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda .

DSM-5에서는 DSM-IV와 동일한 10가지 성격장애의 범주적 접근을 유지하고 있다. 한편DSM-5의 Section III에는 차원-범주 혼합모형(hybrid dimensional-categorical model)이 제안되었다. 이로써 임상가는 개인의 성격기능에서의 어려움과 성격의 병리적 특질패턴에 근거하여 성격장애의 진단과 성격을 평가할 수 있다.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "‘If I can’t feel, if I can’t move, if I can’t think, and I can’t care, then what conceivable point is there in living?’ (Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness) Mood is a person’s subjective emotional state. According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological concerns need epidemiological elucidation\n\nPatients with depressive disorders could be more liable to accidents than others for several reasons. These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age.

Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time. Recommendations for further development of research in this area are provided. (Less)",

Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy.

It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines.

      "abstract": "The author, largely from a clinical standpoint, discusses the various ideas of negation. He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5. Vernachlässigung von Interessen zugunsten des Spielens, erhöhter Zeitaufwand, um zu spielen bzw. zu wetten, bzw. entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu beschaffen, oder sich von den Folgen zu erholen. 6.

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "title": "Sensory and Perceptual Alterations",
      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "abstract": "Sir: Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in motor behavior and changes in thought, mood, and vigilance 1 and occurs in a variety of medical and neuropsychiatric conditions. 2 Catatonia has been documented as occurring in alcohol withdrawal in rodents, 3 but not in humans.We report the case of a patient in whom alcohol withdrawal presented as catatonia.Case report.Mr. A, aged 35 years, presented in January 2006 with a history of alcohol use over the last 10 years.He fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence for the last 5 years.He presented with tremors, irritability, anorexia, and insomnia within 24 hours of abrupt cessation of alcohol intake.Seventy-two hours after cessation of alcohol intake, he developed signs of negativism, mutism, and psychomotor agitation lasting 2 days, followed by psychomotor retardation, stereotypies, and stupor over the next 2 days, fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for catatonia.There were no psychotic or mood symptoms, clouding of consciousness, disorientation, or any general medical condition that could explain these symptoms.He had experienced a similar episode 2 years previous, following 3 days of abstinence from alcohol, that remitted upon treatment with lorazepam.Family history was positive for alcohol dependence in first-and second-degree relatives but was negative for psychotic or mood disorders.The findings of laboratory investigations were within normal limits.As the patient's condition could not be described adequately by DSM-IV criteria for alcohol withdrawal or catatonia, the diagnosis of alcohol-induced psychotic disorder was made, with onset during alcohol withdrawal and presenting with catatonia.Mr. A was treated with lorazepam 16 mg per day and with vitamin supplements.His symptoms remitted completely within 72 hours.Catatonia has been documented in alcohol dependence in relation to drug interactions involving disulfiram 4 and in delirium. 1 The temporal correlation between alcohol abstinence and the appearance of catatonia in the absence of these other causes suggests that the catatonia in this case was due to alcohol withdrawal.Perturbations in γaminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic transmission have been implicated in the pathophysiology of both catatonia 2 and alcohol withdrawal. 5,6 Furthermore, the GABA A modulator lorazepam is effective in both conditions. 1,7 To our knowledge, this case is the first such case reported in the literature.",

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

[2]Also, types of abuse are related to specific psychiatric comorbidity.Sexual abuse is more associated with posttraumatic stress disorder than other kinds of abuse. [3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape.

Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

At least four such categories can be distinguished: assistive devices (a) that are not designed specifically for speech, (b) that take the average characteristics of speech into account, (c) that process articulatory or phonetic characteristics of speech, and (d) that embody some degree of automatic speech recognition. Assistive devices for people with speech and/or language disabilities typically involve some form of speech synthesis or symbol generation for severe forms of language disability. Speech synthesis is also used in text-to-speech systems for sightless persons.

Children with ASD demonstrate early deviations from standard social development that persist across their lifespan. Nonverbal communicative behaviors such as eye gaze, imitation, and joint attention are regarded as foundational skills for the later development of more complex social behavior. The DSM-5 provides five additional specifiers that allow for the clustering of homogeneous subgroups. These five specifiers include: with or without accompanying intellectual impairment; with or without accompanying language impairment; associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor; associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder; and with catatonia.",

Os profissionais da saude que lidam com este grupo etario devem ficar atentos aos sintomas depressivos mascarados, como dores inespecificas, adinamia, insonia, perda de peso e queixas subjetivas de perda da memoria, evitando imputar estas queixas ao envelhecimento pois os tratamentos disponiveis melhoram muito os sintomas e a qualidade de vida dos individuos acometidos.",

      "abstract": "The word \"drug\" in accordance with the definition given by the WHO means \"any substance that, when taken into the living organisms, may modify one or more of its functions\". This thus covers a wider field than the word \"medicine\" or \"medicament\". There are many substances which are capable of provoking anxiety and are very frequently consumed. According to recent publications the use and abuse of alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, marihuana, and drugs such as sedatives (neuroleptics), caffeine, minor tranquilisers and other may provoke acute and chronic anxiety and depression. When confronted with anxiety states or depressive states, it is absolutely essential not to overlook the possibility that they may have been induced by a medicament or a drug which the patient has been using.",

      "title": "Hypnodiagnostic and Hypnotherapeutic Fantasy-Evocation and Acting-out Techniques",
      "abstract": "Abstract During the past five years, we have been experimenting with a number of hypnotic techniques with which to reach patients who have little or no motivation, at least at first, for psychotherapy. For the most part, these techniques have been utilized with patients with real or apparent medical or surgical disease, who had been, so far as can be judged, medically or surgically sick for five, ten or more years. The more usual interviewing techniques frequently could give us no clues, even so far as differential diagnosis (of organic from emotional disease) was concerned. As a result, techniques were devised whereby these patients were hypnotized, sometimes without their knowledge or conscious consent, but nevertheless always with their consent implied, without at any time using the word “sleep” or suggesting eye-closure, so that, by the use of other techniques still under investigation, symptoms could be precipitated or intensified even to the point of having asthmatic or epileptic attacks reproduced, for instance, during the consultation session. By still other techniques, symptom-formation was then blocked and the inevitable, resultant anxiety reaction repressed, so that underlying fantasies could erupt into conscious awareness even to the point of being acted out. An asthmatic patient, for example, when his asthmatic attack was blocked, acted out the killing of his girl friend by knocking her to the floor and jumping over and over again on her abdomen. An adolescent, with what was thought to be probable extra-pyramidal disease, began to masturbate. Examples could be multiplied almost ad inftnitum In all cases, symptoms served more than one function, and several such functions would be acted out either concurrently or one after the other. Such reactions have been utilized for the purpose of differential diagnosis, but not in the more usual sense of the term. We cannot, for instance, say that these patients do not have asthma, epilepsy, etc. By means of these techniques, however, we have found it possible to determine, and to determine rapidly, the neurotic or psychotic functions which their symptoms serve, and, in addition, to state further that, irrespective of whether or not it be asthma, epilepsy, etc., specific patients with these diagnoses can be helped and even “cured,” after having been taken partly or completely off medication, by psychiatric treatment. This can proceed in two different ways: (a) With patients who are poorly motivated toward treatment, substitute symptoms may be set up, provided they serve the same neurotic needs, or other specifically hypnotherapeutic techniques utilized. (b) Patients who can come into a good therapeutic relationship, sometimes as a result of the hypnodiagnostic procedures listed above, can then be treated both (1) by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques, either on non-hypnotic or hypnotic levels, and, in addition, (2) by techniques made possible only by the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. Some of these, again, are acting-out techniques. There is little in the whole field of hypnotherapy that is not controversial. This applies even to a definition of hypnosis. However, from the angle of approach of the material presented in this chapter, we tentatively incline to believe that whatever else, in addition, the hypnotic interpersonal relationship is, it seems to be a fantasy-evoking one in which the patient, on the basis of his own experiential background and with more ready access to his pre-conscious, thinks, feels, experiences, reacts and even acts-out exactly as he believes the hypnotist wishes him to, projecting his own impulses, desires and fantasies to the therapist. Or—and this is of course the same thing—his reaction may negativistically be the very opposite of this. For this reason, when techniques of this type are utilized, no direct suggestion at any time is given the patient. When treatment of this type is decided upon, calculated risks must at times be taken. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting-out by the patient of the fantasies of the therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

They can be determined by the action of various influences and their interactions on functional development of the brain. There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders. The article provides review on most significant neurobehavioral manifestations of developmental impairment of the brain during prenatal, perinatal and early postnatal period. The most known adverse factors causing developmental neurobehavioral dysfunctions in humans as well as in experimental animals are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive effects and sedation (CES) are prevalent in chronic nonmalignant pain populations receiving long-term opioid therapy and are among the most common reasons patients discontinue opioid use. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

      "title": "Deterioration",
      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

U klinickoj slici u starijih osoba u odnosu na mlađe cesce su prisutni: agitacija, psihomotorna retardacija, hipohondrijaza/somatizacije, histrionsko ponasanje, bitno smanjenje unosa hrane i tekucine te pseudodemencija. Dijagnosticki postupci obuhvacaju obavezno uz anamnezu i heteroanamnezu, MMSE, tjelesni pregled, EKG, laboratorijske pretrage + dodatne dijagnosticke pretrage - određivanje vitamina BI 2, folne kiseline, Fe, hormona stitnjace, EEG te CT/MR mozga. Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten. Kod izrazito suicidalnih pacijenta može se dodati klozapin u vrlo niskoj dozi od 6, 25 mg u vecernjoj dozi. Pocetne doze i raspon doza antidepresiva u starijih osoba iznosi Vl- Vi doze za mlade odrasle osobe. Prikaz slucaja: Bolesnica u dobi 76 godina, lijecena u sedam navrata u KB Vrapce pod dijagnozama granicnog poremecaja licnosti, vaskularnedemencijenakonpreboljelog CVI-a i vaskularne depresije. Sklona je dramaticnim demonstrativnim ispadima, somatizacijama i manipulativnom parasuicidalno'm ponasanju. Inace osjetljiva je na psihofarmake zbog vaskularnog parkinsonizma. Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "inal symptoms at the same intensity as before treatment, entailing a return of the same episode and a new episode of illness, respectively [6, 9] . When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "title": "Inflammatory Monocytes in Bipolar Disorder and Related Endocrine Autoimmune Diseases",
      "abstract": "textabstractBipolar disorder (also called manic-depressive illness) is one of the major mood disorders. The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "title": "Dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "title": "Agitation und Aggression in der Psychiatrie",
      "abstract": "Akute Agitation und Aggression zählen mit einer Prävalenz mit über 10 % zu den häufigsten medizinischen Notfallsituationen in der Psychiatrie [1]. Fast jeder zweite Patient, der in eine psychiatrische Notaufnahme kommt, weist Symptome von Agitation auf. Im deutschsprachigen Raum wird unter Agitation in der Regel ein Syndrom verstanden, das durch psychomotorische Unruhe, Erregung und Gespanntheit gekennzeichnet ist und das von stillem Negativismus bis hin zur Hostilität reichen kann [2]. Diese können in wechselnder Ausprägung und in der Intensität rasch veränderlich vorliegen. Häufig wird weitgehend synonym, aber doch mit etwas anderem Schwerpunkt der Begriff (psychomotorischer) Erregungszustand verwendet, der vor allem durch eine ausgeprägte Antriebssteigerung sowie motorische Hyperaktivität gekennzeichnet ist. Sowohl Agitation als auch psychomotorischer Erregungszustand können schließlich mit Gereiztheit, Aggressivität und Kontrollverlust einhergehen. In der angloamerikanischen Literatur wird Agitation dagegen besonders durch ausgeprägte motorische oder verbale Hyperaktivität oder durch Reizbarkeit und unkooperatives Verhalten charakterisiert [3], ein Bild, das eher dem (psychomotorischen) Erregungszustand nach deutschem Verständnis entspricht. Konkrete Anzeichen von Agitation sind z. B. motorische Unruhe, Hin-und-Her-Gehen, intensives Gestikulieren, laute Sprache mit Drohgebärden, Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität sowie mangelnde Kooperation. Die Übergänge zwischen Agitation und Aggression sind fließend. Mündet Agitation in Aggression, kann sich daraus eine akute Gefährdung des Patienten oder seines sozialen Umfelds entwickeln [4]. Aggression umfasst jegliche Form von verbalem, nonverbalem oder körperlichem Verhalten, das für den Patienten selbst, für andere Personen oder für deren Eigentum bedrohlich ist. Agitiertes Verhalten führt häufig zu Aggression und Gewalt. Bei psychiatrischen Patienten wird in bis zu über 80 % der Gewaltdelikte agitiertes Verhalten beobachtet. Insbesondere unbehandelte, junge, männliche Patienten mit Psychosen gelten als Hochrisikogruppe, vor allem, wenn komorbider Substanzmissbrauch hinzukommt [5].",

      "abstract": "A sizable proportion of psychiatric patients will seek clinical evaluation and treatment for anxiety symptoms reportedly refractory to treatment. This apparent lack of response is either due to \"pseudo-resistance\" (a failure to have received and adhered to a recognized and effective treatment or treatments for their condition) or to true \"treatment resistance.\" Pseudo-resistance can be due to clinician errors in selecting and delivering an appropriate treatment effectively, or to patient nonadherence to a course of treatment. True treatment resistance can be due to unrecognized exogenous anxiogenic factors (eg, caffeine overuse, sleep deprivation, use of alcohol or marijuana) or an incorrect diagnosis (eg, atypical bipolar illness, occult substance abuse, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder). Once the above factors are eliminated, treatment should focus on combining effective medications and cognitive behavioral therapy, combining several medications (augmentation), or employing novel medications or psychotherapies not typically indicated as first-line evidence-based anxiety treatments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Persistent Psychosis After a Single Ingestion of “Ecstasy” (MDMA)",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

      "abstract": "To make a diagnosis of concussion, you need a reliable history of 2 things: (1) An acute external physical force applied to the brain AND (2) An impairment in the function of the brain directly caused by the external physical force. One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

This deficit occurs during the time period that has been associated with a dysfunctional inhibitory mechanism that is maximally activated during the 100 millisecond time period (e.g., during the period of temporal integration). The inhibitory mechanism is presently conceptualized as being a \"transient\" or \"fast\" system involved in the serial/sequential processing of information. The inability of certain schizophrenics to serially process may suggest a dysfunctional inhibitory mechanism for which GABA is a potential candidate.",

The medical literature presents and promotes red flags to increase the likelihood of identifying a secondary etiology. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches as well as the data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches. We review the following red flags: (1) systemic symptoms including fever; (2) neoplasm history; (3) neurologic deficit (including decreased consciousness); (4) sudden or abrupt onset; (5) older age (onset after 65 years); (6) pattern change or recent onset of new headache; (7) positional headache; (8) precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise; (9) papilledema; (10) progressive headache and atypical presentations; (11) pregnancy or puerperium; (12) painful eye with autonomic features; (13) posttraumatic onset of headache; (14) pathology of the immune system such as HIV; (15) painkiller overuse or new drug at onset of headache. Using the systematic SNNOOP10 list to screen new headache patients will presumably increase the likelihood of detecting a secondary cause. The lack of prospective epidemiologic studies on red flags and the low incidence of many secondary headaches leave many questions unanswered and call for large prospective studies. A validated screening tool could reduce unneeded neuroimaging and costs.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events.

In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

Üblicherweise werden chronische Insomnien in der ärztlichen Praxis medikamentös mit Hypnotika oder anderen sedierenden Substanzen, wie etwa sedierenden Antidepressiva behandelt. In den letzten 20 Jahren hat sich gezeigt, dass kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutische Ansätze (KVT) bei chronischen Insomnien auch unabhängig von der Ursache erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden.

Pharmacological therapies such as antidepressants and antipsychotics or also called neuroleptics are intend to reduce the frequency and severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenics. Treatment with antipsychotics which oftenly cause some side effects such as dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed.

Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

      "abstract": "Drugs used in sexual assault, which are also called as date rape drugs, are common phenomenon of crime in many countries. In a typical scenario, a perpetrator adds a date-rape drug which has sedative effect into alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person. After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as γ-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It is important to know what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug. In this study, we will present a general approach to date-rape drugs used in sexual assault.",

These analogous states include mental abstraction, lucid dreaming, induced trance (or deep relaxation), voluntary or induced somnambulism (commonly called sleepwalking), and certain varieties of catalepsy and epilepsy. When deployed within Gothic fiction, these states are usually enhanced further through a customary (though scientifically dubious) association with occult phenomena such as prescience and clairvoyance, and with suggestions of personal and sexual violations of the entranced self, the origins of which can be traced to the earliest days of systematic hypnotism in Europe.",

      "title": "Blackout",
      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

Descripción del caso: Masculino de 57 años, con historia de síntomas afectivos, quien ingreso a urgencias diagnosticado con episodio depresivo mayor de características catatónicas, el cual mejoró con el inicio de midazolam y luego titulación de Lorazepam. Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona.

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

This definition is derived initially from behavioral models of learning, and in the field of addiction, most work with sensitization refers to the progressive increase in the motor stimulant effect of amphetamine-like psychostimulants that is elicited by repeated drug administration (2,3). Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

      "title": "Aggression and Violence",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states.

      "title": "Faculty Opinions recommendation of Treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementias with psychopharmaceuticals: a review.",
      "abstract": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms represent common complications in patients with different types of dementia. Predominantly, they comprise psychosis, agitation and mood disorders, disinhibited behavior, impairment of the sleep and wakefulness rhythm, wandering, perseveration, pathological collecting, or shouting. Their appearance is related to more rapid progression of the disease, earlier institutionalization, use of physical restraints, and higher risk of mortality. Consequently, appearance of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia leads to higher costs of care provided and greater distress for caregivers. Clinical guidelines recommend nonpharmacological approaches as the first choice in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms. Pharmacological therapy should be initiated only if the symptoms were not the result of somatic causes, did not respond to nonpharmacological interventions, or were not caused by the prior medication. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines are used. This review summarizes the current findings about the efficacy and safety of the treatment of the neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementias with psychopharmaceuticals. Recommendations for treatment with antipsychotics for this indication are described in detail as this drug group is prescribed most often and, at the same time, is related to the highest risk of adverse effects and increased mortality.

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью. Имеется много сообщений о лекарственно-индуцированном СБН (ЛИСБН), который наиболее часто вызывают антипсихотические средства, антидепрессанты и противоэпилептические препараты. К факторам риска развития ЛИСБН относят пожилой возраст, курение, злоупотребление кофеином и алкоголем, заболевания желудочно-кишечного тракта, высокие дозы препаратов, одновременное применение двух препаратов и более. Механизм развития ЛИСБН связывается с действием лекарственных средств на различные рецепторы и нейромедиаторные системы, особенно дофаминергические. Лечение ЛИСБН предполагает прежде всего отмену лекарственного средства или, если она невозможна, снижение его дозы. Профилактика ЛИСБН основывается на соблюдении принципов рациональной фармакотерапии.",

There is emerging evidence for efficacy of psychological treatments during, following and even prior to the first episode. Important areas for further study are how different treatment modalities can interact productively, and patient and carer preferences for treatment.

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

      "abstract": "Depresi berat merupakan salah satu gangguan jiwa yang sering ditemui yang ditandai dengan 3 gejala utama yaitu afek depresif, kehilangan minat dan kegembiraan, berkurangnya energi hingga mudah lelah. Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang. Proses pelepasan metabolit spesifik ketamin akan merangsang terjadinya peningkatan pelepasan sinaps glutamat yang menyebabkan efek antidepresan. Hal tersebut menunjukkan bahwa ketamin dapat menjadi harapan baru untuk pasien dan peneliti dalam kasus depresi berat.\r\n \r\nKata Kunci: Antidepresan, Depresi Berat, Glutamat, Ketamin",

      "abstract": "Antidepressants are pharmacos high utilizated in medical pratic due to their several prescriptions, such as depressive diagnostics, anxious phobic disorder, among other things. Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

The excessive motor activity apparently is purposeless and is not influenced by external stimuli. There may be extreme negativism that is manifested by resistance to all instructions or the maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved. Additional features may include stereotypes, mannerisms, and automatic obedience or mimicry. 2 What follows is a case in which etomidate produced an unexpected arousal effect, rather than sedation, in a patient with catatonia caused by a high dose of steroids.",

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done.

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "title": "Syncope: an overview of diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Syncope is a syndrome in which a relatively sudden-onset, brief loss of consciousness results from a temporary self-terminating period of total cerebral hypoperfusion (1-4). In this regard, it is important to note that other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, concussions, metabolic disturbances and intoxications) may also cause a temporary loss of consciousness (TLOC) but nonetheless are not ‘syncope’ (3-5). Each of these differ from syncope either by the need for medical intervention to reverse the process (e.g., hypoglycemia) or by the underlying mechanism of the loss of consciousness (e.g., electrical disturbance in epilepsy, trauma in head injury, etc.) or both. Other conditionsmayalsomimic syncope. These are often termed ‘syncope mimics’ or ‘pseudosyncope’, but differ from syncope inasmuch as they do not cause true loss of consciousness (e.g., conversion reactions, malingering, and cataplexy). In itself, ‘syncope’ is not a complete diagnosis. Identifying the cause is important, since syncopemay be amarker of increasedmortality risk in some cases, but even more often may lead to physical injury resulting from falls or accidents, diminished quality-of-life, and possible restriction from employment or avocation. The goal should be to determine the cause of syncope with sufficient confidence to provide a reasonable assessment of prognosis, recurrence risk, and treatment options. The initial step is always the documentation of a comprehensive and detailed medical history (3-7). LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness and ‘loss of consciousness’ (LOC) are complex concepts, but most physicians have a working understanding of what ismeant (8). Essentially, LOC implies not only loss of awareness and appropriate responsiveness to external stimuli, but also loss of postural tone. Occasionally, however, symptoms may suggest that ‘syncope’ is imminent, but the full clinical picture does not evolve at that time; such cases are often termed ‘near-syncope’. In such instances, the patient may experience near loss of vision (‘grey-out’ due principally to transient loss of blood supply to the retina), diminution of hearing, and feeling ‘out-of-touch’ with their surroundings and/or confused. On the other hand, many times patients complain of less well defined symptoms such as “dizziness” or “lightheadedness”. These latter complaints (especially in the elderly)may be due to an illdefined functional cerebral dysfunction triggered by transient hypotension (perhaps not severe enough to cause TLOC), but in most cases it is believed that such symptoms are not related to either ‘syncope’ or ‘nearsyncope’, and shouldnot be reported as such.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams associated with the events, mental or physical distress to traumarelated cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations within the way an individual thinks and feels, and a rise within the fight-or-flight response. These symptoms last for quite a month after the event. Young children are less likely to point out distress, but instead may express their memories through play. An individual with PTSD is at a better risk of suicide and intentional self-harm",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

A differentiation is made between neuroglucopenic symptoms (e.g., confusion, somnolence) on the one hand, and those that arise as a result of the counterregulatory response of the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., tremor, sweating), on the other. The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history. For differential diagnostic considerations not only organic causes, but also adverse drug reactions and a factitious genesis must be excluded. In the event of an emergency (e.g., hypoglycemic coma) the usual form of treatment is the administration of glucoses or glucagon.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "abstract": "Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder present from childhood and often following individuals into adulthood. It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

The diagnostic criteria for mania require the presence of distinct periods of abnormal mood characterized by euphoria, expansiveness, or irritability. The change in mood is accompanied by increased activity or energy as well as other symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased sleep, increased speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, agitation, and increased involvement in risky behaviors. The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed psychiatric history ascertaining the presence of current or previous mood symptoms. Children and adolescents are more likely to present with either rapidly fluctuating or a mixed mood state. Bipolar disorder is associated with high relapse rates, even among those receiving treatment. The first-line medication class is second-generation antipsychotics. Additional psychosocial treatments such as psychoeducation, psychotherapy, and community engagement can also be helpful.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are disturbances of usual sleep patterns or behaviors caused by deregulation of neuronal synchronicity and of the balance of the neurotransmitter system involved in sleep regulation. Insomnia and hypersomnia are frequent sleep disorders, and these are most often treated pharmacologically with hypnotics and wake-promoting compounds. These compounds act on classical neurotransmitter systems, such as benzodiazepines on gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors, and amphetamine-like stimulants on monoaminergic terminals to modulate neurotransmission. In addition, acetylcholine, amino acids, lipids and proteins (cytokines) and peptides, are known to significantly modulate sleep, and thus, are possibly involved in the pathophysiology of some sleep disorders. Due to recent developments in molecular biological techniques, many neuropeptides have been newly identified, and some are found to significantly modulate sleep. Recent discoveries also include the finding that the impairment of hypocretin/orexin neurotransmission (a recently isolated hypothalamic neuropeptide and receptor system), is the major pathophysiology of narcolepsy with cataplexy. A hypocretin replacement therapy is anticipated to reverse the disease symptoms in humans. In this article, we will review the history of neuropeptide research, sleep modulatory effects of various neuropeptides, and the general strategies for the pharmacological therapeutics targeting the peptidergic systems by referring to hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy as an immediate example.",

      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

Approximately 1.5% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and approximately 61,500 deaths involved stimulant use in 2022. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction, stroke) and psychiatric (agitation, delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. Contingency management has been shown to be effective for stimulant use disorder. Other psychosocial modalities may reduce stimulant use among selected individuals; these include individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and community reinforcement. Medications may provide modest benefits, including bupropion with or without naltrexone, topiramate, mirtazapine, and prescription stimulants. Harm reduction interventions such as syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased complications related to stimulant use. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "title": "Cytokines as a Precipitant of Depressive Illness: Animal and Human Studies",
      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated. Keywords: cytokines, cortisol, corticotropin releasing hormone, depression, dopamine, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, interleukin, norepinephrine, serotonin",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

In caffeine intoxication, these symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are not due to a general medical condition or better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. an anxiety disorder). Nicotine is highly lipid‐soluble and rapidly enters the brain after inhalation. Nicotine receptors are found on dopaminergic cell bodies and stimulation of these receptors leads to dopamine release. Withdrawal symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of stopping smoking and include intense craving, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty in concentrating and increased appetite. Nicotine withdrawal can be misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and mania. Withdrawal can also exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.",

W pracy przedstawiono i omówiono doniesienia o niewłaściwym używaniu kwetiapiny, nadużywaniu, a nawet uzależnieniu psychicznym, a także o objawach zbliżonych do tak zwanego zespołu dyskontynuacji, często mylonego z zespołem abstynencyjnym występującym w przebiegu uzależnienia. Na podstawie analizy przedstawionych przypadków wykazano, że większość doniesień dotyczy mężczyzn, szczególnie nadużywających lub uzależnionych od innych, najczęściej licznych substancji psychoaktywnych, a także z zaburzeniami osobowości, często pozostających w konflikcie z prawem. Z tego względu należy pamiętać o ostrożności w przepisywaniu kwetiapiny tym osobom. W artykule dyskutowane są potencjalne mechanizmy, które mogą prowadzić do niewłaściwego używania kwetiapiny. Jest to prawdopodobnie związane z działaniem sedatywnym i przeciwlękowym co powoduje jej częste stosowanie z substancjami pobudzającymi. Również wysokie powinowactwo do receptora H 1 może powodować działanie nagradzające, podobnie jak leki przeciwhistaminowe.",

A technique of nitrous oxide administration beyond the state of intoxication and avoiding the Stage of deep hypoxemia has been described. 3. Physiological changes with this form of anæsthesia are slight and the method may be considered safe. 4. After the anæsthesia, a period of facilitation of mental processes is observed, which is followed by a period of relaxation and sedation. 5. During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9. The theories on the pharmacological action of nitrous oxide and the reason for its choice are discussed.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

Se encontró un nivel bajo de adherencia al tratamiento, el cual es directamente proporcional al grado de introspección del paciente, al apoyo familiar y/o social, a la prescripción de antipsicóticos atípicos, a la buena relación médico-paciente e inversamente proporcional al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, a la prescripción de medicamentos típicos, y a la presencia de reacciones adversas. El conocer estos comportamientos, es un precedente para futuras investigaciones y además es punto de partida para crear estrategias que permitan mejorar la tasa de adherencia al tratamiento por parte de los pacientes esquizofrénicos, desde un punto de vista integral e individualizado a la vez.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

      "abstract": "Many patients experience difficulty swallowing pills, for I various reasons: * discomfort (particularly pediatric and geriatric patients) * postsurgical need for an alternate route of enteral intake (nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, jejunostomy) * dysphagia due to a neurologic disorder (multiple sclerosis, impaired gag reflex, dementing processes) * odynophagia (pain upon swallowing) due to gastroesophageal reflux or a structural abnormality * a structural abnormality of the head or neck that impairs swallowing. (1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations. Helping patients find a medication formulation that suits their needs strengthens adherence and the therapeutic relationship.

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued. Drugs such as the benzodiazepines (or phenobarbital)",

(2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences.

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

      "title": "CLCN2-Related Leukoencephalopathy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

In recent years, psychedelics such as psilocybin have also shown considerable promise as therapeutic agents when combined with talk therapy, for example, in the treatment of major depression or substance use disorder.2 However, it is currently unclear whether the aforementioned acute subjective effects are necessary to bring about the observed therapeutic effects of psilocybin and other psychedelics. This uncertainty has sparked a lively-though still largely hypothetical-debate on whether psychedelics without subjective effects (\"nonsubjective psychedelics\" or \"non-hallucinogenic psychedelics\") could still have the same therapeutic impact, or whether the acute subjective effects are in fact necessary for this impact to be fully realized.3,4,5.",

Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

More specifically, déjà vu may result from (a) a brief change in normal neural transmission speed causing a slightly longer separation between identical messages received from two separate pathways, (b) a brief split in a continuous perceptual experience that is caused by distractions (external or internal) and gives the impression of two separate perceptual events, and (c) the activation of implicit familiarity for some portion (or all) of the present experience without an accompanying conscious recollection of the prior encounter. Procedures that involve degraded or occluded stimulus presentation, divided attention, subliminal mere exposure, and hypnosis may prove especially useful in elucidating this enigmatic cognitive illusion.",

Dieser Umstand führt dazu, dass die Pflege der Patienten durch Angehörige oder Pflegekräfte in Heimen eine besondere Herausforderung darstellt. Während die Evidenzen für pharmakologische Interventionen (Cholinesteraseinhibitoren sowie Melatonin) eher schwach sind, ist die Evidenzlage für die Kombination aus sensorischer Stimulation, Lichttherapie und Melatonin überzeugend. Dennoch werden meist sedierende Antipsychotika oder Benzodiazepine eingesetzt, um das Schlafverhalten zu verbessern. Aufgrund des negativen Nebenwirkungsprofils und erhöhten Mortalitätsraten ist der Einsatz dieser Pharmaka jedoch als äußerst kritisch zu sehen. Zu den nicht pharmakologischen Interventionen gehören kognitive und validierende Interventionen, sensorische Stimulationstherapien (dazu gehören Musiktherapie, Aromatherapie, Massage, Lichttherapie, multisensorische Therapie und Akupunktur), Techniken zur Veränderung des Verhaltens sowie andere psychosoziale Interventionen. Griechische Wissenschaftler haben in einer kürzlich publizierten Arbeit die Studienlage zur sensorischen Stimulatiion in Hinblick auf das Schlafverhalten dementer Patienten sondiert und zusammengefasst. Es wurden nur randomisierte, kontrollierte Studien mit Fokus auf Schlafstörungen eingeschlossen. Insgesamt wurden nur 11 Studien mit einer Gesamtzahl von 760 Patienten eingeschlossen, wovon 1 Studie die Effekte von Massagetherapie und Akupunktur untersuchte, während die restlichen 10 Studien die Effekte von Lichttherapie (zwischen 5000 und 10 000 Lux) untersuchten. 6 Studien zur Lichttherapie zeigten dabei positive Ergebnisse in Bezug auf die Schlafqualität, während in den anderen 4 Studien keine positiven Effekte nachgewiesen werden konnten. Da 4 der 10 Studien zur Lichttherapie eine relativ niedrige Fallzahl (< 25) aufwiesen, ist die Aussagekraft des Reviews allerdings nicht wirklich hoch. Auch war die Dauer der Intervention sehr heterogen (zwischen 10 Tagen und 3,5 Jahren). Die Studie zur Massagetherapie und Akupunktur mit insgesamt 111 Patienten wies ein positives Ergebnis auf.",

      "title": "THE HYPNOTIC AND HYPNOTHERAPEUTIC UNMASKING INTENSIFICATION, AND RECOGNITION OF AN EMOTION",
      "abstract": "1. When indicated, in order to facilitate rapid, radical, short-term therapy, patients may be hypnotized and then treated, sometimes successfully, both by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques and by techniques made possible only as a result of the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. It should be stressed, however, that we do not consider hypnosis of itself either a therapeutic agent or a therapeutic technique. Patients with surgical disease are treated (i. e., operated upon) not by but under anesthesia; and likewise patients with emotional disease can be treated psychotherapeutically not by but under hypnosis. Our approach is channelizing and directive, rather than suggestive or aggressive. 2. A number of extremely specialized hypnotherapeutic techniques now exist. Among these is one that for want of a better term we have characterized as the hypnotic unmasking, intensification, or recognition of an emotion. Some patients blot out conscious awareness of emotion. Though not felt spontaneously, it can nevertheless be aroused under hypnosis. If this particular technique be utilized, the emotion of the moment may erupt into conscious awareness with such intensity as to result even in the acting out of fantasies underlying those attitudes and symptoms that have caused so much difficulty to the patient in his relationship with other human beings. Sexual fantasies, naked anxiety, or pronounced rage reactions frequently come to the fore. These patients, however, seem to know almost instinctively, in view of the frequency of psychotherapeutic sessions and the time intervals between them, exactly how much anxiety they can tolerate during any one session. The problem, therefore, seems to be not so much that of the patient's anxiety as the psychiatrist's. Nevertheless, since defenses do not constitute an automatic brake, it must be emphasized over and over again that this technique is much too dangerous for use by therapists if they be nondynamically oriented or inadequately trained. 3. The reactions elicited may be treated along dynamic lines, but without verbal consideration and investigation of transference relationships. It seems to be the intense emotional experience of the therapeutic sessions, sometimes by itself but usually only when tied in with reaction patterns, motivational bases of behavior, early attitudes, and present difficulties in interpersonal relationships, that somehow is integrated into the personality structure and thereby helps make it possible for the patient to achieve warmer, more adequate, and more satisfying relationships with those other human beings with whom he finds himself—or wishes to find himself—in intimate daily contact. 4. Calculated risks must at times be taken when treatment of this type is decided upon. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting out by the patient of the fantasies of his therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided. 5. During this discussion, we have restricted ourselves specifically to the clinical applications—diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic—of this technique. We believe it may also find use as a research tool, but in our opinion such research—and, in fact, all research with hypnosis—should be under supervision by dynamically oriented psychiatrists.",

      "abstract": "Stimulant drugs such as amphetamine, nicotine and Ecstasy/MDMA, are taken for positive reasons such as mood enhancement. Yet their repetitive use can lead to a range of psychobiological deficits and psychiatric distress. There are several underlying neurobiological factors for this. Their acute subjective effects are typically positive, with greater alertnessand emotional engagement. However during the post-drug recovery period the opposite states predominate, with feeling of tiredness and sadness. Every recreational central nervous system (CNS) stimulant drug causes this mood fluctuation. They are most evident in drugs with a very rapid onset and come-down, such as cocaine or nicotine. Hence regular smokers report good moods immediately after smoke inhalation, followed by poor moods 30-60 minutes later. This rapidity of these mood changes with nicotine and cocaine, helps explain why they are also the most addictive. Parallel fluctuations occur across many other psychological functions, with impoverished cognitive skills when off-drug. CNS stimulant drugs also adversely affect the HPA axis, impairing sleep and disrupting homeostasis. These core psychobiological problems help explain their adverse psychiatric effects, since fluctuating mood states and disrupted homeostatic stability, can exacerbate any prior psychiatric susceptibilities (for anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, or other disorders). In summary, the repetitive stimulation of the CNS by recreational drugs can be very damaging to the organism, both acutely and chronically.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "abstract": "Zimeldine, the first selective neuronal serotonin (5-H1) reuptake inhibitor to be registered as an antidepressant was withdrawn from common use due to an acute flu-like adverse syndrome comprising fever, myalgia and/or arthralgia and signs of disturbed liver function. A few of these patients also developed a peripheral neuropathy, in the most serious form a Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The reaction was tentatively termed a hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS).Patients who had developed a HSS during zimeldine therapy (HSS-patients) were compared to control patients who tolerated the drug.No predictor to the HSS emerged concerning demographic data, psychiatric illness, previous medical history, medications with zimeldine or other drugs, other diseases, professional or nutritional circumstances. Nor was there any sign that HSS-patients who also developed neurological symptoms had a different profile of the HSS than other HSS-patients. Earlier zin1eldine treatment per se was not seen to predispose for development of a HSS or any other kind of adverse experience during subsequent therapy. The spectrum of adverse reactions was in agreement with those reported in previous studies and no new case of the GBS was revealed. The estimated frequency of HSS ranged from 0.63 to 3.4 % in spontaneous reports to the regnlatory authority and 1.4- 13% in a written inquiry. Among closely monitored inpatients 31 %developed a HSS. The mechanism for the HSS does not seem to be related primarily to the 5-HT reuptake inhibition as such. No HLA-associated disposition for the HSS was found. Nor was there any support for a HLA-associated disposition for depressive disorders. The pathogenetic mechanism for the HSS seems to involve an inlmunological response to antigens related to zimeldine.Zimeldine and its main primary metabolite norzimeldine both suppressed clinical signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) in Lewis rats. Imrnunomodulatory effects in vitro of zimeldine, its metabolites norzimeldine and CPP 200 as well as of other monoamine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants were identified in the same EAN model.These observations call for further research on immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of mental disorders as well as on the potential role of drugs acting on the monoamine systems in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The findings also justify a discussion on the application of immunological methods in the testing of new psychopharmacological drugs.Based on the presented results the tentatively used term for the adverse reactions to zimeldine, the hypersensitivity syndrome, seems justified.",

First, epileptiform discharges not presenting as obvious seizures may nevertheless affect cognition and/or behaviour. Second, the actual seizures may be obvious but the way they affect cognition or behaviour may not be. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the epileptiform discharges in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes can affect behaviour and cognition. The focal discharges in other forms of epilepsy can also be associated with behavioural change. The Landau‐Kleffner syndrome, the CSWS syndrome, transitory cognitive impairment and transient epileptic amnesia provide further examples of cognitive and behavioural manifestations resulting from subtle manifestations of the epilepsy. Prompt, effective antiepileptic treatment with medication or surgery can improve behaviour and cognition in at least some cases.",

These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis canbe difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially,he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and internal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active temporal focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

The Drug Commission of the German Medical Profession (AKdA) received reports concerning tiredness, somnolence (even with new antihistamines), CNS-stimulation, nervousness, insomnia and paroniria have also been observed. Furthermore cases of dyskinesia have been reported, which are already described in the literature after long term intake, as well as anticholinergic reactions. Despite of their use as antiallergic drugs, reports on hypersensitivity reactions due to antihistamines, up to anaphylactic reaction have been not infrequently received by the AKdA. In rare cases disturbances of blood cell formation have been reported besides observations of gastrointestinal disorders, increase of appetite and weight. Abuse of antihistamine containing drugs was reported mainly for combinations with psychotropic agents.",

      "title": "Recommendation for a definition of acute symptomatic seizure",
      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

      "title": "Treating insomnia with medications",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a conspicuous problem in modern 24 h society. In this brief overview, medications used to treat insomnia such as hypnotics, sedatives, medications inducing sedation as a side effect, medications directed at the sleep-associated circadian neuroendocrine system, and agents utilized in treating insomnia-inducing sleep diagnoses such as restless leg syndrome are discussed. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia with the majority of evidence supporting treatment efficacy for cognitive-behavioral therapy and short acting GABA-receptor agonists. In patients with comorbid insomnia the use of hypnotics can improve outcomes and potentially reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the use of more toxic medications. Except in individuals whose insomnia is secondary to circadian disturbance, mood disorder/depression and/or restless leg syndrome , there is minimal evidence supporting the efficacy of other medications used to treat insomnia despite their widespread use. Sedatives and other medications used off-label for sedative side-effects are a contributing factor to drug induced hypersomnolence, a factor in more than 30% of motor accident deaths. Hypnotic medications with low toxicity, addictive potential, minimal next day sleepiness, and an otherwise benign side-effect profile can be utilized safely and effectively to treat and improve function and quality of life for patients suffering from insomnia. These are the agents that should be exclusively classified as hypnotics and utilized to induce sleep when medications are required to treat the complaint of insomnia. Other pharmacological agents producing sedation (sedatives and agents used off-label for sedative side-effects) should be used cautiously for the treatment of insomnia due to the increased risk of next day sleepiness as well as for known toxicities and adverse side effects.",

Hypnosis inappropriately or ineptly applied, with suggestions that do not take into account the subject's psychological state or vulnerabilities, can result in short and long term deleterious effects. These adverse effects result more from a lack of psychological understanding of the practitioner and the particular vulnerabilities of the patient rather than being dangers of the hypnotic state or process. A lack of appropriate therapist training in hypnosis and hypnotically- based therapy, inadequate understanding of the subject or patient and the pathological psychological processes, and the processes of psychotherapy and the hypnotic process itself, increases the risk of adverse effects.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

MDMA reduces the level of these neurotransmitters within the neural synapses by reducing the number of intraneural transporters to the synaptic clefts, increasing deactivation with the synapse and/ or increasing degradation with the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Users may have varied reasons for MDMA use and therefore require help and support from their families or friends, and knowledgeable and well-skilled healthcare professionals for successful abstinence, avoidance of further psychological damage and a reversal of adverse health effects or reduction in their severity.",

      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

      "title": "Reducing inhibition: A promising new strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder presenting with positive (hallucinations, delusions, psychomotor agitation), negative (flat affect, anhedonia), and cognitive (impaired executive functions) symptoms. Current therapeutic approaches include second generation antipsychotics that primarily alleviate positive symptoms via modulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission. These treatments remain moderately effective with between 10% and 30% of patients showing little symptomatic improvement, and an additional 30% to 60% experiencing partial improvement or severe side effects during antipsychotic therapy (Lehman et al., [[5]Lehman A.F. Lieberman J.A. Dixon L.B. TH McGlashan Miller A.L. Perkins D.O. et al.Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, second edition.Am J Psychiatry. 2004; 161: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar]). Current pharmaceutical developments aim to target other neurotransmitter systems, specifically the glutamatergic system. The end goal of these novel approaches is to restore the excitatory/inhibitory balance (E/I) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [[6]Moghaddam B. Javitt D. From revolution to evolution: the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia and its implication for treatment.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2012; 37: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar]. Prefrontal E/I imbalance is thought to be a major contributing mechanism to schizophrenia pathology, especially cognitive symptoms [[4]Kehrer C. Maziashvili N. Dugladze T. Gloveli T. Altered excitatory-inhibitory balance in the NMDA-hypofunction model of schizophrenia.Front Mol Neurosci. 2008; 1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Specifically, observations that N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists such as ketamine and MK-801 induce phenotypes resembling positive and cognitive symptoms led to the conclusion that hypofunction of glutamatergic signaling via NMDA-R underlie some of the schizophrenic symptoms [[6]Moghaddam B. Javitt D. From revolution to evolution: the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia and its implication for treatment.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2012; 37: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar]. Restoring glutamatergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia is the therapeutic approach taken by Fan et al. [[2]Fan H.-R. Du W.-F. Zhu T. Wu Y.-J. Liu Y.-M. Wang Q. et al.Quercetin reduces cortical GABAergic transmission and alleviates MK-801-induced hyperactivity.EBioMedicine. 2018; ([current issue])Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar]. They used quercetin, a natural flavonoid that acts as a negative allosteric modulator for GABAA receptors (GABAA-Rs), to reduce inhibition in the PFC and potentiate glutamatergic transmission, effectively alleviating the positive symptom of MK-801-induced hyperactivity in mice [[2]Fan H.-R.

Wang Q. et al.Quercetin reduces cortical GABAergic transmission and alleviates MK-801-induced hyperactivity.EBioMedicine. 2018; ([current issue])Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar]. This approach can be seen as controversial given observations of GABAergic neurotransmission abnormality in the schizophrenia brain. Impaired parvalbumin (PV)-dependent GABAergic transmission is recognized to be one of the main molecular mechanism responsible for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia [[3]Gonzalez-Burgos G. Lewis D.A. NMDA receptor hypofunction, parvalbumin-positive neurons, and cortical gamma oscillations in schizophrenia.Schizophr Bull. 2012; 38: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar]. Similarly, other research has demonstrated that reducing GABAergic transmission in the PFC by blocking GABAA-Rs induces some positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia in rodents [[1]Enomoto T.

Therefore, GABA agonists or positive allosteric modulators are also under investigation as novel therapeutics for schizophrenia, aimed at calibrating prefrontal E/I balance by reducing excitation [[8]Vinkers C.H.

The inhibitory GABA system as a therapeutic target for cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia: investigational agents in the pipeline.Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2010; 19: 1217-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar].

Wang Q. et al.Quercetin reduces cortical GABAergic transmission and alleviates MK-801-induced hyperactivity.EBioMedicine. 2018; ([current issue])Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar] support the therapeutic effects of negatively modulating GABAA-R in a rodent model of MK-801-induced hyperactivity. The exact mechanisms involved are elusive and require further study. Potentially, regulation of GABA transmission by quercetin could act through two distinct mechanisms in the PFC. First, quercetin might act in a cell type-specific manner. Future research should examine whether quercetin acts primarily upon GABAA-Rs on inhibitory or excitatory neurons in the PFC and determine the resulting net effect on prefrontal E/I balance. For instance, quercetin could inhibit GABAA-Rs on hypofunctional PV-expressing cells, thereby promoting excitatory drive onto these cells and subsequently restoring appropriate levels of inhibition onto prefrontal pyramidal neurons. In support of this hypothesis, NMDA-R antagonists like ketamine and MK-801 act first on PV-expressing cells as these neurons exist in a more depolarized state with a higher number of open NMDA-Rs compared to excitatory neurons [[3]Gonzalez-Burgos G. Lewis D.A. NMDA receptor hypofunction, parvalbumin-positive neurons, and cortical gamma oscillations in schizophrenia.Schizophr Bull. 2012; 38: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, [6]Moghaddam B. Javitt D. From revolution to evolution: the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia and its implication for treatment.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2012; 37: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar]. Cell type-specific electrophysiological recordings after treatment with quercetin would help address these questions. Alternatively, quercetin's therapeutic effects may involve homeostatic mechanisms. Blocking GABA receptors classically increase excitation. However, if excitation on a given neuron increases beyond a set point, homeostatic mechanisms can intervene to reduce excitation onto that cell in an effort to maintain balance. In schizophrenia, when prefrontal GABAergic transmission is impaired, blocking GABAA-Rs with quercetin may push synaptic activity levels above the threshold to trigger homeostatic mechanisms and restore inhibition and functional E/I balance. This phenomenon has been reported in other regions of the brain where elevated activity levels can cause compensatory increases in the amplitude and/or frequency of inhibitory post-synaptic currents [[9]Wenner P. Mechanisms of GABAergic homeostatic plasticity.Neural Plast. 2011; 2011: 489470Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar]. Though this idea remains highly speculative, it would be an interesting hypothesis to test in future studies with quercetin, possibly by measuring electrophysiological changes to inhibitory currents, or by examining posttranslational modifications to the GABAA-R scaffolding protein gephyrin and other proteins involved in the structure and function of GABAergic synapses. The findings of Fan and colleagues are especially notable given a recent publication describing two case studies in which augmenting conventional antipsychotic treatments with quercetin improved therapeutic outcomes in schizophrenia patients [[7]Schwartz D.L. Quercetin as an augmentation agent in schizophrenia.J Clin Psychopharmacol. 2016; 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. Together, these provide early evidence in both rodents and humans for a novel, unexplored treatment that targets the interplay between excitation and inhibition in the PFC. Interestingly, several GABAA-R inverse agonists have shown potential for treating cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia [[8]Vinkers C.H. Mirza N.R. Olivier B. Kahn R.S. The inhibitory GABA system as a therapeutic target for cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia: investigational agents in the pipeline.Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2010; 19: 1217-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar], and negative allosteric modulation of α5-containing GABAA-Rs may be beneficial for depression, another disorder marked by prefrontal E/I imbalance [[10]Zanos P. Nelson M.E. Highland J.N. Krimmel S.R. Georgiou P. Gould T.D. et al.A negative allosteric modulator for alpha5 subunit-containing GABA receptors exerts a rapid and persistent antidepressant-like action without the side effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine in mice.eNeuro. 2017; 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar]. Moving forward, future research should investigate the cognitive effects of quercetin treatment and aim to elucidate its therapeutic mechanisms of action. Prefrontal E/I balance is critical for healthy emotional and cognitive functioning, and understanding how GABA antagonism fits into the puzzle of E/I interactions may prove invaluable for treating multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. The authors declare no conflicts of interest. Quercetin Reduces Cortical GABAergic Transmission and Alleviates MK-801-Induced HyperactivityAn imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition represents a core feature in multiple neuropsychiatry disorders, necessitating the development of novel strategies to calibrate the excitatory–inhibitory balance of therapeutics. Here we identify a natural compound quercetin that reduces prefrontal cortical GABAergic transmission and alleviates the hyperactivity induced by glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801. Quercetin markedly reduced the GABA-activated currents in a noncompetitive manner in cultured cortical neurons, and moderately inhibited spontaneous and electrically-evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic current in mouse prefrontal cortical slices.

Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

Of these, 23 were included in this review for their specificity to SSRI use in AD or indications on efficacy beyond depressive symptoms. The other 34 citations were excluded because: (1) depression or other mood or behavioral disturbance severity was the reported outcome measure, (2) effects of SSRIs on cognition were confounded by concomitant use of other drugs, (3) subjects described were young adults, and/or (4) subjects had traumatic brain injury. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 3rd Quarter 2006, yielded six citations related to SSRIs.Data extracted from clinical trials included name of SSRI tested, cognitive outcome measures, and adverse events reported, which could include cognitive worsening.Preclinical evidence for use of SSRIs to enhance cognition in AD includes an effect at the hippocampus through carbonic anhydrase activation or stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis. The chemical structure of paroxetine, and not intrinsic SSRI activity, may also affect APP ectodomain expression to reduce amyloid plaque formation. Clinical trials in AD generally have not assessed cognitive outcomes independently from mood or behavior stabilization. Currently, clinical studies in AD only indirectly support the use of SSRIs for disease modification by confirming a serotonergic deficit during the course of illness.Lack of supportive evidence for SSRIs as cognition enhancers or disease modifiers in AD is the result of omissions in clinical trial design, as opposed to reporting of negative outcomes. The preclinical evidence warrants the study of SSRIs in AD using mood, behavior, cognition, neurochemistry, and possibly neuroimaging as outcome variables.",

The classic phenomena of hypnosis, such as sensory anaesthesias, analgesia, amnesia, and posthypnotic suggestion, provide prima facie evidence of altered consciousness, but some theorists contend that these are the products of normal mental processes, such as suggestion and expectation. In this article, hypnosis is viewed against a general framework for describing ASCs in terms of four converging operations: induction procedure, subjective experience, behavioural correlates, and physiological correlates. Although ŉeutral’ hypnosis, in the absence of specific suggestions, has few distinctive characteristics, many of the classic phenomena of hypnosis involve dissociations between explicit and implicit memory, or perception, such that percepts, memories, and thoughts influence ongoing experience, thought, and action outside conscious awareness and control.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibiity seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleo-vestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

It is concluded that: (i) Differences in the clinical status of the schizophrenic subjects and whether they were receiving medication, but not the method used to measure aftereffects, may underlie the interstudy disagreements. (ii) The effect of schizophrenia is to increase MAE duration, and this is not due to some peripheral artefact.

      "abstract": "The expression “New Synthetic Stimulants” include classes of psychoactive compounds that share subjective effects in humans such as boosted mood or euphoria, feelings of empathy or compassion, increased sociability and sex drive, perceived increased ability to learn and focus, increased energy and alertness, with unpleasant outcomes like increased blood pressure and heart rate, paranoia or aberrations, decreased appetite, raised body temperature, clenched jaw or grinding teeth, dry mouth, insomnia, hallucinations, and aggressive or violent behavior. Synthetic stimulants act in the brain by increasing concentrations of neurotransmitters, mainly dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine is involved in attention, reward, and motivation whereas serotonin is involved in generating feelings of happiness and pleasure. Synthetic stimulants act on the two brain systems to different extents, accounting for their range of effects. Noradrenaline release is also stimulated by these compounds, but to a minor degree. In any case, long‐term use of synthetic stimulants exhausts dopamine and serotonin systems in the brain. The nerve cells become desensitized to the drugs, which makes them resistant to the brain's own signaling molecules. This leads to tolerance and dependence, which can easily turn into addiction. Like classic stimulants (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine), new synthetic stimulants can be highly addictive. This article is categorized under: Toxicology &gt; New Psychoactive Substances",

In the medicated patients, medical drugs are mainly responsible for their insomnia. However, it is sometimes difficult to find these drugs. The pathological sleep (i.e., delirium) are often developed following the drug-induced insomnia. Medication against insomnia (i.e., benzodiazepines) often exacerbates the pathological sleep. Therefore, common types of insomnia, drug-induced insomnia and pathological sleep should carefully be discriminated. Drug-induced rhythm-disorders and drug-induced sleep apnea remain to be studied. Future studies may clarify the effects of several drugs on these two disorders.",

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "The effect of any one psychoactive drug on an individual is a function of its interaction with that individual; for this reason, the effect upon one person may not be the same as on another person. When two or more drugs are given at the same time, their effect may be one of antagonism, synergism or potentiation. The effects of a psychotropic drug (ataxia, incoordination, altered level of consciousness or awareness, disturbances of vision and increased reaction time) must surely impair the skills required for safe driving. Many prescribed drugs acting principally on the central nervous system are capable of impairing driving performance: analgesics, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics and tranquillizers. Other prescribed drugs: anti-histamines, hypotensive agents, hypoglycaemic substances may produce undesirable side effects which impair driving performance. In Queensland if breath analysis indicated a BAC too low to account for a driver's behaviour, a doctor is called to examine the driver, and samples of blood and urine are forwarded to a central laboratory. If the blood concentration of a drug equals or exceeds the accepted therapeutic level of the particular substance, the driver is considered to be under the influence of the drug. The most dangerous period is during the initial stage of taking a prescribed drug. Psychotropic drugs taken in prescribed dosage may initially produce drowsiness, ataxia, impaired judgement and increased reaction time. After a period of time, tolerance to the drug develops, with marked reduction in unwanted side effects. The most common drugs include morphine, pethidine, methadone, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The common purpose for such abuse is to get high -a stage of unreality characterized by euphoria and/or hallucinations, either visual or auditory or both. Intoxication by any of these drugs produces severe impairment of driving skills. An exaggerated pharmacological effect commonly occurs when alcohol is taken at the same time as another psychoactive drug. Benzodiazepines are the prescribed drug most commonly involved in instances of driving impairment, both alone and in combination with alcohol. Some drugs commonly associated with impaired driving performance are: mandrax, methadone and diazepam. The extent of the contribution of drivers impaired by drugs and drug-alcohol interaction to traffic accidents has not yet been defined. It will not be defined until all countries enact effective legislation to enable such drivers to be identified. The use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs in Australia has been increasing steadily over the past few years, and continues to increase. It is impossible to obtain accurate figures on the consumption of psychotropic drugs in Australia. (Shortened Author Abstract/TRRL)",

      "abstract": "Manic-depressive illness is recently named as a mood disorder according to the ICD-10 or DSM-III R diagnostic criteria. It consists of two opposite states, manic state and depressive state. Typical manic symptoms include a pathologic delightful mood, flight of ideas, heightened level of activity and sexual interest. Grandiosity, rapid and pressured speech, increased energy and decreased need for sleep are also frequently seen. On the other hand, depressive symptoms are characterized by prolonged depressive mood, inhibition of thought, lowered level of activity, depressive ideas or delusions and various somatic dysfunctions such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance. Mood disorders are often seen in association with organic brain diseases, collagen diseases such as SLE, some endocrinological diseases and medication. Diagnosis of manic or depressive states is usually carried out by careful psychiatric interviews. No specific somatic symptoms or signs have been identified for manic-depressive illness. Many rating scales, for instance Zung's SDS or HDSR, have been utilized as diagnostic aids. Rating scales and the symptomatology and diagnosis of manic-depressive illness are described in general.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Although synesthesia can occur in response to drugs (LSD, mescaline, peyote), sensory deprivation, or, in rare cases, brain damage, research has largely focused on individuals with the heritable trait of developmental synesthesia. Synesthesia has no known association with any disorder or condition, and research suggests a higher occurrence among artists and musicians. Furthermore, synesthetes will often lament the loss of these experiences that sometimes occurs because of depression or the use of antidepressants.",

Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome. One umbrella category for neurologically related somatic symptoms, functional neurological disorder (FND), presents as involuntary neurological symptoms incompatible with another medical condition. Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. Being mindful of these challenges when treating patients presenting with functional symptoms in acute care settings can help to support and protect the patients and care team and appropriately control healthcare costs.",

      "abstract": "Neurophysiological Observations in Cases of Trauma and AddictionMany literature studies have shown how the effects of trauma [6,7] and severe drug-addiction [8,12] can capture the mind of the affected individual making it gravitate entirely around the traumatic memory and the substance abuse, respectively to the complete detriment of any other memory or everyday activity.For this reason, any external stimulus not directly connected to trauma or addiction has minimum impact on these individuals, with drastic consequences on their learning and mnemonic processes.The ability and motivation to learn new functional strategies, as well as new life skills, is impaired, as is the capacity to control oneself and not give-in to impulsive behaviors [13,14].",

      "title": "Auswirkungen von depressiven Störungen auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit und die Fahrkompetenz",
      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

Key Messages• Haloperidol or second-generation antipsychotics used to prevent or treat delirium did not decrease length of stay in hospital.• There was little or no evidence to determine the effect of antipsychotics on cognitive function, delirium severity, or caregiver burden, or for sedation when used for prevention.• Second-generation antipsychotics may lower the occurrence of delirium in postoperative patients.• Haloperidol or second-generation antipsychotics used to prevent or treat delirium may lead to little or no difference in sedation or extrapyramidal side effects (problems with muscles such as spasms or restlessness).Heart-related side effects tended to occur more frequently with the use of antipsychotics, in particular QT interval prolongation (a type of heart rhythm problem) in second-generation antipsychotics.• Future studies are needed to assess the effects of using antipsychotics on patient agitation and distress, subsequent memories of delirium, caregiver burden and distress, inappropriate continuation of antipsychotic therapy, and long-term cognitive and functional outcomes.iii",

      "title": "Touching the unconscious in the unconscious – hypnotic communication with unconscious patients",
      "abstract": "If hypnosis means contact to the unconscious to modulate psychological and physiological functions by means of suggestions, and if this is facilitated by attenuation of the critical mind, then the question arises as to whether suggestions also have an effect when waking consciousness is otherwise eliminated, namely by coma or anesthesia. A prerequisite would be perception, which actually is evidenced by reports of patients after traumatic brain injury, artificial coma, resuscitation or general anesthesia. Moreover, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently observed after these medical situations is hardly explainable without some sort of awareness under such conditions. Even advanced neurophysiological diagnostic cannot yet rule out consciousness or sensory processing. Especially reference to perception during unconsciousness is given by the results of a recent multicenter study on the effects of hypnotic communication with patients under controlled adequate deep general anesthesia. The observed reductions in incidence and severity of postoperative pain, opioid use, nausea and vomiting cannot be explained by the reaction of a few but only by a considerable proportion of patients. This leads to a strong plea for a more careful treatment of unconscious patients in the emergency room, operating theater or intensive care unit, for the abandonment of the restriction of therapeutic communication to awake patients, and for new aspects of communication and hypnosis research. Obviously, loss of consciousness does not protect against psychological injury, and continuation of communication is needed. But how and what to talk to unconscious patients? Generally addressing the unconscious mind with suggestions that generally exert their effects unconsciously, hypnotic communication appears to be the adequate language. Especially addressing meaningful topics, as derived from the basic psychological needs and known stressors, appears essential. With respect to negative effects by negative or missing communication or to the proposed protective and supporting effects of therapeutic communication with patients clinically rated as unconscious, the role of consciousness is secondary. For the effects of perceived signals and suggestions it does not matter whether consciousness is absent, or partial, or unrecognized present.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "title": "Subjective Well-being and Initial Dysphoric Reaction under Antipsychotic Drugs - Concepts, Measurement and Clinical Relevance",
      "abstract": "Since the introduction of neuroleptics in 1952, many studies have examined objective aspects of efficacy and tolerability. Despite the fact that neuroleptic treatment should also improve the patient's subjective experiences, this outcome criterion has been neglected in the past. This is unfortunate, as subjective well-being with treatment appears to be strongly related to patients' readiness to take their medication. The few existing studies differ in methodology and are difficult to compare due to a number of weaknesses, including varying underlying concepts, used assessment scales, or small sample sizes. Negative subjective well-being may manifest itself throughout the entire neuroleptic treatment, even as early as in the first 48 hours after neuroleptic treatment starts (initial dysphoric reaction, IDR). The aetiology of reduced subjective well-being or IDR is not fully explained; neuroleptic side effects, especially affective, cognitive and motor adverse events, differential effects of varying psychopathology or biopsychosocial are factors in discussion. The clinical impression is characterised by symptoms as dysphoria/anhedonia, reduced vitality, and emotional indifference, which could have a negative impact on relevant clinical factors such as response or medication adherence, and therefore on outcome. With regard to pharmacological treatment, evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics induce less negative subjective effects than conventional neuroleptics, and that various new-generation antipsychotics could be evaluated differently by patients. This article reviews existing literature in order to approach relevant questions for pharmacotherapy.",

      "title": "1. The Influence of Drugs upon Testimony",
      "abstract": "A wide range of drugs (medicines) are used currently, many of which are designed to affect brain function. Others do so as a side-effect. The effects depend on how the body deals with the drug (pharmacokinetics) and how the drug affects the body, including the brain (pharmacodynamics). An extensive range of effects on the brain and psychological functioning can ensue, including effects on intellectual functioning, dexterity, memory, learning and subjective effects. Individual factors are important and can profoundly influence both the type and extent of drug effects. Relevant drugs can be divided into: 1. Those prescribed primarily to treat psychiatric disorders. These include sleeping tablets, tranquillizers, antidepressants and antipsychotics. 2. Those used to treat neurological disorders that have psychological side-effects. Examples are anticonvulsants and anti-parkinsonian drugs. 3. Those used to treat non-nervous disorders that may have psychological side-effects. 4. Illicit drugs used in the non-medical context by drug addicts. Drug-induced states that can influence testimony are mainly sedation, disinhibition, paradoxical reactions and alterations in memory. A list of pointers was given in this paper with respect to practical considerations in assessing the possible effects of drugs on testimony.",

Screening for MDD is recommended in the general adult population when resources are available for diagnosis, management, and follow-up. Several screening tools are available, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC). Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence. Referral to a psychiatrist or other mental health clinician should be considered when the diagnosis is in question or when symptoms do not improve with standard treatment.",

These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

      "abstract": "Many patients have problems which are not exclusively medical or psychiatric but a mixture of both.It is specially important to remember this when taking a history.Otherwise physicians and psychiatrists run the risk of missing the diseases that fall within each others' province.Organic Brain Syndromes Amnesia, dementia, and confusion have areas of overlap that can be ciarified in the individual by a full history from patient and relatives, along with the observations and comments of trained staff who have been looking after the patient.The information that is needed can be summarized thus: (a) Orientation in time and space.(b) Memory for recent and past personal events.(c) Memory for recent and past general events.(d) Attitude and behaviour in the ward or clinic.(e) Mood, activities, sleep pattern.Confusional states are characterized by loss of immediate memory, which in an unfamiliar setting inevitably involves disorientation.After recovery there is no recollection of the episode, and overall mental function may prove to be normal.It is, then, an acute reversible situation.Dementia is a composite of intellectual decline, loss of memory, and personality de- terioration.It is usually, but not always, of slow onset and represents severe, generalized, cortical damage.Amnesia does not necessarily mean that dementia is present; some quite specific acute amnesic syndromes occur in a relatively pure form.",

We report two cases of neurologic complications requiring hospitalization in patients when atomoxetine was added to other psychoactive drugs.

An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first. Clinicians should be aware of emergent dyskinesias when combining atomoxetine with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic medications.",

      "abstract": "Mental illness can arise from over-compensation of neural processes when they attempt to correct nervous system perturbation, regardless of the original cause. Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Biological, environmental, behavioral, and social factors can influence sleep and lead to sleep disorders or diseases. Sleep disorders are common, numerous and heterogeneous in terms of their etiology, pathogenesis, and symptomatology. Management of sleep-wake circadian disorders (SWCD) includes education to sleep hygiene, behavioral strategies, psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly), instrument-based treatments (i.e. positive airway pressure therapy, hypoglossal nerve stimulation), and pharmacotherapy. Depending on the disease, therapy varies and is executed sequentially, or can be a combination of several forms of therapy. Drugs used for SWCD include traditional sleep or wake-promoting agents, chronotherapeutic agents. Recently, novel medications, which are more precisely acting on specific neurochemical systems (i.e. orexin system) important for sleep and wake, are also increasingly being used. In this review, the pharmacotherapy of common sleep disorders (insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorder, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders) embedded in the overall therapeutic concept of each disorder is presented. There is also an outlook on possible future pharmacotherapies.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "title": "In children with autism, is intravenous secretin more effective than placebo in improving social skills, communication, behaviour or global functioning?",
      "abstract": "This kind of question arises frequently in an autism follow-up clinic or other developmental disability setting. The parents of children with autism are bombarded with information about their child’s condition: “you should try…” or “you should have avoided…”, and often ask their physician for support in the form of either information, services or advocacy. Physicians rarely have good information on which to base their decision to support such a family. The secretin story illustrates a number of important clinical issues.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to evaluate the efficacy of new therapies, especially in a chronic behaviour-based condition like autism. Because secretin is administered by injection, either once or by infrequent repeats, it is relatively easy to administer in a ‘blinded’ fashion. Other interventions are not as easily studied. Outcomes are difficult to measure in autism, even relatively concrete ones like ‘gastrointestinal symptoms’. It is rare that a new therapy will be subjected to this kind of research evaluation (ie, multiple randomized controlled trials) so quickly, so we are usually left to make decisions or recommendations without good evidence. Interventions should be assessed on their theoretic basis (does it make any sense given what we know about the condition?), their potential risks and costs (including ‘opportunity costs’), and on the evidence, whether anecdotal or more scientifically validated. It is wonderful to have even one treatment for autism where there is scientifically valid information.\r\n\r\nThe secretin experience is an important lesson in the politics of alternative therapies. There has been argument about the type of secretin to use (porcine versus human recombinant), about the number of injections to give (and if multiple injections were safe!), and about the possibility that there is a subgroup of responders hidden within the group data. Some physicians felt comfortable giving this injection, while others did not. Some families were able to find supplies, while others couldn’t. One of the research teams commented on the ease with which they recruited families for study, given the high interest and lack of clinical access. The company manufacturing human recombinant secretin (RepliGen, Waltham, USA) recently discontinued their Phase III study of children with autism for lack of evidence of efficacy (1), but they continue with trials for other indications.\r\n\r\nA very important outcome of multiple secretin studies was the frequency of ‘placebo response’ that was identified. Approximately 30% of children in the various studies had ‘improvement’ in their symptoms of autism during the study period, although this turned out to be unrelated to secretin. This implies that in other clinical situations there is a similar chance of improvement associated with interventions in which one believes (whether of proven or of unproven benefit). Chronic disabling conditions like autism require ongoing management, and children with autism often receive therapies of no proven benefit (whether accepted or ‘alternative’). It is very easy to interpret improvement in some children during treatment as ‘proof’ of benefit, which would appear to be the basis for the many anecdotally ‘successful’ therapies in autism or other chronic disabling conditions.",

      "title": "Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) presenting as catatonia: A case report in a psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Catatonia has always been in the limelight of psychiatric nosological systems and now has been assigned a special chapter in DSM-5.[1] Catatonia secondary to general medical condition, more commonly called as organic catatonia, is being increasingly recognised in the recent years.[2] Few studies have also described the symptom profile, etiological aspects, and treatment response of organic catatonia.[3,4] FENIB is a rare hereditary degenerative condition of the central nervous system.[5] Individuals with this condition exhibit low attention and focus, diminishing work or academic performance, and language difficulties and eventually endure a deterioration in intellectual capacities (dementia).[6] There have reports of additional symptoms, such as uncontrollable, erratic muscular spasms, seizures, mood changes including apathy, despair, and hostility.[7,8] Eventually, the afflicted individuals need thorough supportive conservative medical care and management of comorbid conditions (myoclonus, seizures etc.). The key pathological finding in FENIB is the presence of neuronal inclusion bodies distributed throughout the gray matter of the cerebral cortex and in certain subcortical nuclei.[5] However, FENIB presenting as catatonia is not yet reported, and probably ours is the first case report in this regard, suggesting to include FENIB in the list of etiological conditions of organic catatonia. CASE DESCRIPTION The index patient was a 24-year young female, studied till 9th standard, from a nuclear family, of lower middle socioeconomic status, second in birth order, born out of full-term normal vaginal delivery, maintained well during childhood, and attained all the developmental milestones normally for her age with poor scholastic performance. As per the informants (parents), she was able to do all household chores, was able to understand the concept of money, and reportedly was fast in grasping all the concepts. She failed in her 10th standard, and thereafter, she did not wish to study further. She used to help with all the household chores efficiently until around 2016, would interact with family members, and would be euthymic. In 2016, when she was around 17 years of age, with apparently no precipitating event, she started to avoid doing household chores, had reduced interaction with family members, had decreased emotional reaction on hearing any sad or happy news, and would not actively participate in any family discussion which was quite unlike her premorbid self. She would be seen sitting idle in front of the television for the whole day in the same place. She would keep looking in one direction for a period of 2 to 3 minutes without blinking. She would not bathe, brush, and eat by herself; would eat only when served; and did not show much change in facial expressions. On many occasions, she noted to wear her clothes upside down and would not bother much about the same; during her menstrual cycle, the patient would not take care of her hygiene. Over the years, she gradually started to respond in very few sentences or just by nodding her head in yes or no. Due to gradual worsening of her condition, she was brought to our outpatient psychiatric services in October 2023 and a diagnosis of Catatonia was considered with possibility of an underlying psychotic illness (schizophrenia with predominantly negative symptoms). When rated on Busch Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), she scored 14, but on administering 2 mg intravenous lorazepam (Lorazepam Challenge Test), it was negative (no change in BFCRS score). A working diagnosis of catatonia and simple schizophrenia was kept, after which she was planned for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). She was started on Tab. Aripiprazole 5 mg OD. However, in the next few days, her catatonic signs and symptoms worsened (posturing, staring, negativism, closing her mouth on being fed, resisting any possible body movement, and even started to pass urine and faces in her clothes). Ten effective modified ECTs were administered, and she was admitted to our inpatient psychiatric services for diagnostic clarification. Following ECTs, she had gradual reduction in the catatonic signs, and BFCRS score reduced to 4 [Table 1].Table 1: Rating on the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale on serial evaluation and response to ECTIn ward observation and serial mental state examination, she was found to behaving oddly, would be seen smiling inappropriately, would not understand any commands, and continued to pass urine and stool in her clothes and appear unbothered by it. She was found to have severe inattention, echolalia and echopraxia (repetition of same words and actions), perseveration (continuous type abnormally prolongs or repeats a behaviour without interruption), utilization behaviour (she tried holding any object handed near to her), grasp reflex present, and frontal release signs. In neurological examination, she had brisk deep tendon reflexes (3+), and plantar reflex was flexor. Rigidity was present in all the four limbs (4/5); however, it could be due to catatonic negativism. Fundus examination was normal. Tab aripiprazole 5 mg was stopped in the first week, and after 2 weeks of stopping ECTs, she had relapse of catatonia with BFCRS score rising up to 17. ECTs were restarted, and after 7 ECTs, catatonia improved [Table 1]. Neurology consultation was taken in view of suspicion of organicity as there was the presence of diffuse cerebral atrophy on MRI (brain) at the young age of 24 years. All the metabolic parameters including serum ceruloplasmin and blood levels for heavy metals were normal. Following which blood investigation for whole genome exome sequencing was sent (report usually takes 1 month time). She was kept on weekly maintenance ECTs as every time a gap of 5 days of ECT was given, she had relapse of catatonic signs and she was discharged from inpatient psychiatric facilities. Around 1 month later, she developed an episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures (lasting for 2 to 3 minutes) and was unconscious for 20 to 25 minutes. Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed seizure activity, and she was started on phenytoin 300 mg/day. The whole genome exome report revealed that she had a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance in exon 9, SERPINI1 gene (variant – c.1178G.C, p.Arg393Pro, Depth-64x; Genomin nomenclature – Chr 3;g.167543056G>C), which had an autosomal dominant inheritance and was diagnosed with familial encephalopathy, with neuroserpin inclusion bodies. Family members were counselled about the diagnosis and future expectations from treatment. Genetic testing of parents could not be done due to financial constraints. There was no family history of epilepsy of similar symptoms in parents or in any relatives. The absence of similar symptoms in parents could possibly be due to de novo mutation resulting in a pathogenic variant, as has been reported in a few case reports.[9] Due to frequent relapse of catatonia, she had been kept on maintenance ECTs every fortnightly and phenytoin 300 mg/day from neurology. On follow-up until date, she is maintaining reasonably well and able to do self-care activities but is having gradual cognitive decline as evident from assessment of Hindi Mini-Mental State Examination Scale ranging from 15 to 17 always (which is the natural course of the disease – FENIB). DISCUSSION The index case highlights the importance of evaluating for organic cause in patients presenting with catatonia with unusual presentation. The patient initially presented with symptoms suggestive of negative symptoms of schizophrenia and subsequently presented with catatonia, which almost simulated the presentation of catatonic schizophrenia.[10] However, after a thorough investigation and the hunch of the possibility of organic cause (due to frequent relapse of catatonia when ECTs were stopped/spaced in the absence of any gross psychotic/positive symptoms along with cognitive impairment at a young age), we were able to reach to the diagnosis of FENIB. In many secondary and tertiary care psychiatric settings in low and middle-income countries, the facilities to perform a thorough organic workup are not available, and hence, many a time, many patients with unusual presentation with catatonia are labelled/misdiagnosed as schizophrenia/psychosis, and are treated with multiple antipsychotics/other types of treatment strategies.[11-13] The age of onset, rate of progression, and severity of FENIB varies depending on the specific mutation in the neuroserpin gene.[5] The symptoms of FENIB may become apparent as early as the first decade or as late as the fifth or sixth decade of life. Our knowledge of FENIB is limited by the fact that only a few families with FENIB have been described.[6,14,15] In late onset illness, affected individuals typically experience declining cognitive function that affects their ability to work. In addition to deficits in attention, concentration, and language usage, an impaired ability to judge the spatial relationship between objects (poor visuospatial skills). A striking finding is perseveration, a condition marked by uncontrolled, repetitive behaviors such as continually repeating a word, phrase, or gesture, present in the index case.[5] Daily living skills are gradually lost, and they become increasingly dependent on family or other care givers. Eventually, most will require comprehensive care in a skilled nursing facility. Other symptoms may include tremor, motor restlessness, dystonia (sustained muscle contractions associated with abnormal, uncontrolled movements and postures), and occasionally seizures.[8] The rate of decline is relatively slow, and with adequate supportive care, patients may survive for many years or even decades.[5] When FENIB begins earlier in life, from the first to third decade, there are additional neurological symptoms and the disease may progress quite rapidly. Seizures may be the first manifestation, including a syndrome called progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME).[7,8] The seizures may be difficult to control with medication, and episodes of status epilepticus or persistent, repetitive seizures may occur, sometimes resulting in death. In general, an earlier age of onset is associated with more severe symptoms, and the patient may survive for only a few years.[16] Cognitive deficits have been mostly reported in frontal and frontal-subcortical areas in the reported cases across the globe.[6] Few case reports suggest that patients with G392R and G392E variants have onset of symptoms at the age of 7–8 yrs and 11–13 years, respectively (i.e., childhood onset FENIB) and often present with PME and gradual cognitive decline.[9] In the index case, the onset of symptoms started around the age of 17 years and had G393 variant in exon 9 of chromosome 3. The treatment of FENIB is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Individuals with progressive dementia often experience frustration, anxiety, and depression due to their decreasing ability to function in certain aspects of their lives.[5] These frustrations may be minimized by maintaining a stable home environment and a structured routine that does not place excessive demands on the affected individual. Eventually, most individuals with FENIB require comprehensive medical care as provided in a nursing home. Genetic counselling is recommended for affected individuals and their families.[5] Catatonia as presenting symptom in a case of FENIB has not been reported yet, and therefore, ours is the first case to report this finding, which resolved with ECT, further highlighting the role of ECT in the management of organic catatonia not responding to lorazepam. As evident from the recent literature review, FENIB is limited to a handful of case reports, suggesting the need for more research on this disorder.[9] A close collaboration between psychiatrists, neurologists, and physicians is needed to diagnose and manage patients with FENIB.

      "abstract": "The behavioral therapies are bringing with them a new and interestingly effective approach to the treatment of sexual disorders based upon theories of learning. The two basic means used are: (1) reciprocal inhibition, as shown in J. Wolpe's (1958, 1961) systematic desensitization, wherein anxietyprovoking situations are overcome by the presentation of graduated fear stimuli in the presence of relaxation, and (2) aversive techniques, wherein pleasureful sexual sensations are converted to painful ones by chemical or electrical means. Systematic desensitization is what its name implies, a systematic or gradual desensitization to a noxious agent, through the use of the patient's visual imagination. It is most successful when employed against anxiety-provoking situations such as impotence, premature ejaculation, and frigidity. Also against the nonsexual aspects of homosexuality, exhibitionism, and other sexual deviations. The pleasureful aspects of the sexual deviations present another problem. It is no easy task to induce a person to give up what to him is exquisite pleasure. Consequently, aversive therapy is used to convert the pleasure into pain. More of this later. Systematic desensitization is preceded by the taking of a detailed history as in any good medical examination. The history is of particular importance; it is used to determine the fear elements which enter into a disorder. As an instance, a woman who feared snakes was given a realistic synthetic snake to handle. She did so without compunction. Asked why it had not disturbed her, she replied that it was not the snake itself that bothered her, but the eyes and the forked tongue. Any list of fears must include these items separately. For another example, Eysenck (1960) recorded the history of a man with impotence which was present only when attempting intercourse with his wife at home; he did not experience it anywhere else. It appeared that as a young man he had been surprised by an irate husband in the process of seducing his wife. The husband thrashed the patient within an inch of his life. It happened that the wall",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Several neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in elders with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) can be part of a major depressive episode (MDE) or a “subthreshold” depressive episode. Certain neuropsychiatric symptoms of CIND are essential symptoms of MDE (e.g. dysphoria, anhedonia), while other are non-essential symptoms (NESD; e.g. fatigue, insomnia, cognitive complaint). Contrary to essential symptoms, NESD are not specific to MDE and are present in other disorders. It is unknown whether NESD are linked to CIND in absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. The present study examined the association between NESD and probable CIND in elders without essential MDE symptoms. Methods: Participants were 2028 community-dwelling individuals aged 65–96 years who had not experienced dysphoria/anhedonia during the year preceding the interview. Semi-structured in-home interviews evaluated the following NESD: alteration of appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor alteration, fatigue/loss of energy, worthlessness/guilt, and cognitive complaints. Probable CIND cases were defined based on the Mini-mental State Examination cut-offs (15th percentile) stratified for age, education and sex. Results: Symptoms of fatigue/loss of energy (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.42–4.09), sleep disturbance (OR: 3.04 CI: 1.69–5.46) and cognitive complaints (OR: 2.86 CI: 1.71–4.77) were significantly associated with CIND. These associations were not modified after adjustments for potential confounders (age, education level, sex, benzodiazepine use, chronic diseases, and brain disorders). Conclusion: A psychiatric symptomatology occurs in older adults with CIND in the absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. NESD encountered in the absence of dysphoria/anhedonia should receive particular attention by clinicians since they can be linked to cognitive difficulties.",

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

      "abstract": "We report a case of 26 years old gentleman diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder who developed mania after one week of initiation of quetiapine at 200mg/d. Induction of mania in our patient is keeping with the literature regarding induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at a lower dose of quetiapine. Hypomanic or manic symptoms at a low dose of quetiapine are brief and seem to reverse the effect by either discontinuing the causing agent or increasing it dose. Quetiapine being an atypical antipsychotic possess antidepressant property at low doses as well as mood stabilizer at higher doses. At lower dose, due to its serotonergic antagonism property, quetiapine appears to induce or worsen hypomanic or manic symptoms. As the dosage increases its dopamine antagonistic activity become more prominent and the medication acts as a mood stabilizer. This is one of the possible explanations of disappearing of manic or hypomanic symptoms at a higher dose.",

      "abstract": "RésuméL'auteur passe en revue les études que l'on a faites sur l'emploi des stimulus en-gendrant la répugnance, ou de la diéthylamide de l'acide lysergique dans le traitement de l'alcoolisme. Ces stimulus étaient l'apomorphine, l'émétine, la scoline et le choc électrique. Rien n'indique à l'évidence que ces méthodes sont plus efficaces que les autres, non excitantes, pour traiter les alcooliques. L'échec de ces méthodes est parfois attribuable à des modes de conditionnement défectueux. Ainsi, (1) la difficulté qu'on éprouve à régler l'intervalle entre la présentation du stimulus conditionné (SC) (alcool) et la survenance du réflexe non conditionné (RNC) (nausée et vomissements). L'intervalle critique (de 0 à 5 secondes) entre le SC et le RNC est d'une extrême importance dans le conditionnement classique; (2) L'effet hypnotique souvent produit par les drogues productrices de nausées, qui peut rendre difficile le processus du conditionnement. Cependant, même lorsqu'un réflexe de répugnance à l'alcool est bien conditionné, il peut ne pas suffire à produire des modifications du comportement chez le buveur. Rien non plus ne vient prouver l'efficacité thérapeutique particulière du LSD.L'auteur met en lumière la difficulté d'évaluation de la plupart des études passées en revue et il expose les conditions minimales qui président à des études bien faites. Il propose d'accorder plus d'attention, dans la future recherche, aux variables que présentent les sujets et les modes d'administration, ainsi qu'aux méthodes de postcure.",

Symptomatic Herxheimer reactions occur not only after the administration of spirocheticidal drugs but also during fever therapy (especially induced malaria).

      "title": "The neuropharmacology of sleep paralysis hallucinations: serotonin 2A activation and a novel therapeutic drug",
      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is a state of involuntary immobility occurring at sleep onset or offset, often accompanied by uncanny \"ghost-like\" hallucinations and extreme fear reactions. I provide here a neuropharmacological account for these hallucinatory experiences by evoking the role of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Research has shown that 5-HT2AR activation can induce visual hallucinations, \"mystical\" subjective states, and out-of-body experiences (OBEs), and modulate fear circuits. Hallucinatory experiences triggered by serotonin-serotonergic (\"pseudo\") hallucinations, induced by hallucinogenic drugs-tend to be \"dream-like\" with the experiencer having insight (\"meta-awareness\") that he is hallucinating, unlike dopaminergic (\"psychotic\" and \"life-like\") hallucinations where such insight is lost. Indeed, hallucinatory experiences during sleep paralysis have the classic features of serotonergic hallucinations, and are strikingly similar to perceptual and subjective states induced by hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin), i.e., they entail visual hallucinations, mystical experiences, OBEs, and extreme fear reactions. I propose a possible mechanism whereby serotonin could be functionally implicated in generating sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions through 5-HT2AR activity. Moreover, I speculate on the role of 5-HT2C receptors vis-à-vis anxiety and panic during sleep paralysis, and the orbitofrontal cortex-rich with 5-HT2A receptors-in influencing visual pathways during sleep paralysis, and, in effect, hallucinations. Finally, I propose, for the first time, a drug to target sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions, namely the selective 5-HT2AR inverse agonist, pimavanserin. This account implicates gene HTR2A on chromosome 13q as the underlying cause of sleep paralysis hallucinations and could be explored using positron emission tomography.",

Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder may kick and flail, scream, fall out of bed, or engage in complex behavior that emerges from the content of their vivid, fearful dreams. Patients usually seek help only after they have injured themselves or their bed partners during sleep. Serious physical injury is possible. Often REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with the use of psychotropic medication or with a definable underlying neurological disorder. In an acute form of REM sleep behavior disorder, there is a more sudden onset of symptoms as a consequence of a toxic or abnormal metabolic state, including alcohol withdrawal, or in association with the use or discontinuation of psychotropic medications.",

The same drugs can cause both psychomotor excitement or psychic slowness. In a few instances psychotic syndromes can be observed. Very important are chronic side effects on intellectual activities, especially in children.

In special constellations this can profoundly affect compliance with the medication as well as quality of life. Some patients are more vulnerable to side effects than others. Side effects can have profound impact on the development and future life of a patient. Some antiepileptic drugs (e.g. topiramate, zonisamide) show a more severe side effect profile than others (e.g. lamotrigine, levetiracetam). Thus, in the treatment of epilepsy, it is crucial to consider such possible side effects – especially in the beginning of or while changing the medical treatment. Specific neuropsychological examinations can monitor side effects on cognitive functions like concentration, memory or speech function. If this is not possible in an ambulant setting, specific screening instruments and repeated and precise interviews of patients and/or relatives can help to discover potential side effects. Because most side effects can be reversible, dosage modification or drug replacement is required as soon as incompatibilities are discovered.",

Alongside with deficient disorders PMD are the main characteristics of post-traumatic disturbances of consciousness. PMD can be represented by different types of excitation, mistaken judgments (including paranoidal ones, confabulations, false orientation), false perception (psychosensory, in particular, illusory and hallucinatory phenomena) and affective disorders. Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly). Irritation of different brain structures and their disconnection as well as pathological neuroplasticity in prolonged forms--are considered the basis for PMD occurrence.",

There is a multidirectional continuum of anesthetic states—some represented by CNS excitation and others by depression. 2. The reticular activating system is influenced by all anesthetics; some inhibit its action (stage III) and some hyperexcite the system resulting in a function disorganization (stage II-C). 3. Some agents traverse both excitation and depression, diethyl ether (I, II, III). 4. Others induce only stage II—catalepsia, e.g. nitrous oxide, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-chloralose, phencyclidine, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 5. Others induce no stage II but progress directly from stage I stage III, e.g. halothane and barbiturates. 6. Cataleptic agents may induce further CNS excitation manifested by seizures, e.g. gamma-hydroxybutyrate, phencyclidine, ketamine, alpha-chloralose, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 7. The functional definition of surgical anesthesia is: a stage induced by a drug that makes the subject relatively unresponsive to painful stimuli and amnestic. Thus, the subject does not respond during surgery and cannot recall what happened afterwards. This state can be achieved by functional disruption of CNS systems by marked stimulation or depression.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome: Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, Management, and Potential Future Directions",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

      "abstract": "The hysterical personality means an infantile personality plus ‘something extra’. This ‘extra’ which complements the infantilism of hysteria, are determined by the following constellation of factors: (1) an immature, underdeveloped, emotional personality with a feeble identity; (2) due to the relatively great need for warding off emotional influences, the personality is more vulnerable to emotional stress; (3) a predisposition to deficient repression, leading to insufficient mental defence; (4) an auxiliary auto-regulation in the form of states of lowered consciousness and convulsions or fits, to keep the overwhelming emotional influences outside his awareness. Freud elucidated the dynamic relationships in an impressive way; he described all that can be called neurotic in hysteria. But we know that hysteria encompasses more than various types of neurosis, and can also manifest itself in psychotic and psychopathic-like patterns of behaviour.",

      "title": "Epileptic seizures and headache/migraine: A review of types of association and terminology",
      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

Two patterns - one consisting in catalepsy, posturing, mutism and negativism and a second consisting of echophenomenon, automatic obedience, verbigeration, and other stereotypies - have been abstracted. Catatonia has been associated with psychiatric disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for example - as well as secondary to various underlying medical conditions.It will be described a case report of a 55 years old woman with prior psychiatric history of hospitalization with an unspecified nonorganic psychosis (F29-ICD10), presenting features of catatonia - immobility with fixed posture and gaze (sometimes presenting posturing), an almost absence of spontaneous movements and speech, echophenomenon (echolalia, palilalia, coprolalia) erupting in a otherwise mute state and showing, on occasions, periods of purposelessness motor excitement and restlessness, verbigeration and screaming with a grim of terror. She was disoriented and performed poorly on the MMSE. No neurologic focal signs were disclosed other than prominent primitive reflexes. Prior to admission, her family reported a sudden mood change: she became irritable, argumentative, with delusional thought content of persecutory nature, grandiose ideas. Viral and immune-mediated encephalitis were discharged. The MRI scan showed a right temporal medial lesion (amygdala atrophy). It will be addressed the hypothetical relationship between the dramatic clinical presentation and the cerebral lesion, grounded on the scientific research regarding limbic encephalitis, catatonic symptoms and neurophysiology. It will also be underscored the clinical relevance of differentiated psychopathology of catatonia.",

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\") is a unique drug, sharing properties of hallucinogens and stimulants. The acute effects of empathy, euphoria, and excitement for which it is used recreationally can make it overwhelmingly distracting for the user in the context of driving. This review considers the chemistry, synthesis, analysis, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and documented effects of MDMA on cognitive and psychomotor skills important to driving. Laboratory studies show that users do experience cognitive impairments, and may also act more impulsively while under the influence of the drug's sympathomimetic effects. Psychomotor impairment may occur with elevated doses or after repeated administration, and residual psychomotor impairment during the \"coming-down\" phase may be compounded by fatigue, dehydration, combined drug use, or other confounding factors. There is growing anecdotal information providing evidence of MDMA-impaired driving, and it is evident that many users recognize and attempt to mitigate the effects by delaying driving until the acute affects have dissipated. The drug inevitably may affect a subject's judgment and ability to properly assess their fitness to drive also. Blood concentrations in MDMA-impaired drivers suggest that this impairment can be caused by normal patterns of recreational use, and MDMA use should be considered inconsistent with safe driving immediately following ingestion, and for up to a day or longer following use.",

It is associated with loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the hypothalamus, hypocretin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid below 110 pg/ml, and the HLA genotype DQ B1*0602. A less common form of narcolepsy without cataplexy probably has a different, as yet unknown, pathogenesis. Once established, narcolepsy is lifelong; spontaneous recovery does not occur. Symptomatic treatment—which is essential for school performance, work, driving ability, and quality of life—is with stimulant (e.g. amphetamine) and anticataplectic (e.g. clomipramine) drugs. More recently, sodium oxybate, an anaesthetic, has been used to induce deep sleep overnight, resulting in improvements in all symptoms.",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

Transient distortions of consciousness; cognition; speech, word-finding problems, and jargon; affect; sensory; and behavior. Parasomnias are unusual behaviors occurring during sleep: arousal disorders; sleep-wake transition disorders; disorders associated with rapid eye movement sleep; and other disorders. The risk of developing late posttraumatic seizures is strongly determined by the severity of brain injury. Hypersomnia is excessive sleepiness or sleeping and has a variety of psychological or physiological causes. Epilepsy is a recurrent brain disorder of multiple etiologies and is characterized by recurrent seizures due to the excessive discharge of cerebral neurones.",

Lightheadedness, meaning a feeling like the patient may pass out, is usually due to low blood pressure, often orthostatic hypotension. Vertigo, meaning a sensation of spinning or movement, can be an inner ear problem or a brain problem: Stop toxic substances; if there is nystagmus, refer to ENT for a full evaluation; perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to assess for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; and refer to physical therapy for repositioning maneuvers if positive; consider vestibular rehabilitation; consider a short course of medication such as scopolamine or meclizine; consider ordering an MRI scan of the brain, as sometimes the concussion unmasks another unrelated problem. Dizziness meaning “mental fogginess” usually turns out to be attention deficit. Dizziness meaning vague and nonspecific malaise usually turns out to be fatigue, depression, or anxiety.",

      "abstract": "The data concerning neurophysiological and neurotransmitter mechanisms of two principal kinds of inhibition of behavior is carried out: the inborn genetically determined inhibition and that developed in the course of training. On the basis of the experiments performed by the author and the literature on general neurophysiology the conclusion is made that development of inhibition of behavior during training (i.e. internal inhibition, including \"latent inhibition\") is determined by the relative strengthening of inhibitory hyperpolarization processes either locally (in a conditioned stimulus analyzer) or globally in the brain cortex and other brain structures during intensification of the inhibitory state (profound inhibition of a reflex and sleep). The main neurotransmitter in development of internal inhibition is gamma-aminobutyric acid. Inhibition of behavior without preliminary training arises either during the action of superstrong stimuli, (exceeding the maximum value inhibition) or during interaction of two and more active systems. A stronger one of these two systems suppresses another one (external inhibition, dominant inhibition, \"freezing\", \"prepulse inhibition\", etc.). These kinds of inhibition develop on the background of EEG activation, which suggests participation in their realization of reticular structures and corresponding neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, noradrenalin, dopamine and serotonin). Behavior pathology causes a break of the balanced interaction between the excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system. This affects both genetically determined forms of behavior inhibition and the learned internal inhibition.",

      "abstract": "Four cases of compulsive self-injurious behaviour (SIB) with variable degrees of tissue damage targeted to the painful body part are reported in humans with neuropathic pain. Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central nervous system (CNS) lesions, during which non-psychotic verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually analgesic or hypoalgesic. In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole. The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, confusion or depression, and occasionally occurring in patients with personality disorders, ongoing drug abuse and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking). It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain. Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases. The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal autotomy may result from chronic neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or CNS lesions.",

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

      "abstract": "Aggressiveness is a threatening behavior that results in mental, physical or material harm. It can be directed towards oneself, towards other persons or towards objects / things. Aggression can be expressed physically, verbally or even by neglect. Aggression in individuals depends on various risk factors and factors that influence the dose of aggression and therefore aggressive escalation. As in society and in the population, so do aggressive individuals find themselves in psychiatric wards. There are various psychic conditions that lead to an aggressive act. Schizophrenic patients can act aggressively as well as people who are in an alcohol overdose or people who have been overdosed on opioid substances. Any patient who tries to injure himself, another person, or who tries to cause great material damage shall endeavor to be taken care of by non-punitive or coercive methods. Deescalation procedures based on communication with the patient and using communication skills through which the patient seeks to calm down with words and the atmosphere during communication are cited as non-striking methods. Coercive methods are only used when non-coercive methods have failed. Forcing methods include pharmacological therapy, isolation and physical restraint. Pharmacological therapy involves the appeasement of the patient by administering therapy or medication. Isolation is the process of separating an aggressive patient from other patients from the ward into a specially arranged room where he or she resides until the physician estimates that the patient can return to the room where he or she resides with other patients. Physical restraint is the last phase of coercive methods, it involves the humane physical restraint of the patient with the aim of calming the patient and ceasing to be aggressive. The extremities, head and chest are fixed. The patient is unbound only when the physician determines by psychophysical assessment that the patient no longer needs to be fixed. Education is a very important process in such cases. Educating staff eliminates their possible fear or insecurity and increases the security of all people in the department where aggressive escalation can occur.",

      "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to describe the different neuropsychological deficits associated to the consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'), as well as the growing evidence that attributes these deficits to the selective axonal damage to serotoninergic cells brought about by this substance.MDMA is an amphetamine derivative that, like its precursor, has properties as a stimulant. Part of its chemical structure is similar to that of the hallucinogen mescaline with which it shares the capacity to alter perception. Nevertheless, the primary pharmacological effect of this substance, which is what usually leads to its use and abuse, is chiefly linked to an intense positive emotional state. This effect on the individual's mood is also usually accompanied by numerous feelings of empathy, sociability and closeness, which turn this drug into a powerful entactogenic agent (a term used in psychotherapy to describe a state of wellbeing, closeness and emotional self-awareness produced by certain compounds). The antidepressant and entactogenic effects induced by an acute dose of MDMA can be accounted for by the notable increase in serotonin bioavailability triggered by the drug. Repeated consumption of MDMA, however, ends up affecting many functions that have been related to the serotoninergic systems, such as sleep, appetite, attention and memory, or one's emotional state.Most of the neuropsychological disorders found in individuals who take ecstasy on a regular basis can be explained by the selective neurodegeneration processes that the drug appears to produce in the serotonin terminals of the brain in the long run.",

Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

The most important one is akinesia, which includes decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, slowness of movement, awkwardness and freezing.

The estimation of locomotor activity can be done accurately in animal models. Tremor can be studied using the animals treated by cerebral focal lesion, neurotoxins or cholinomimetics.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

      "abstract": "Regarding the treatment of insomnia, it is said that a considerable degree of advancement has been made to date in terms of controlling toxicity, preventing the development of tolerance and avoiding addiction, which were often observed when administering barbiturates. Nevertheless, the majority of hypnotics used today, which are benzodiazepines, still retain certain side effects such as hangover effects, development of dependence, rebound insomnia as a withdrawal symptom, muscular atonia resulting in falling down and causing bone fracture, inhibition of respiratory system, negative interaction with alcohol, etc. The current trend of selecting hypnotics is to use short-half-life agents. However, there are yet other problems such as cognitive disorders including amnesia, rebound insomnia and increased anxiety during the daytime. In order to cope with these problems, three new hypnotics have recently been developed. They are non-benzodiazepine derivatives and considered to be safer than the others, because they are supposed to cause less side effects than conventional hypnotics. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these new hypnotics can be summarized as follows: 1) these hypnotics have selective affinity to benzodiazepine receptor omega-1 subtype although the agent itself does not belong to the benzodiazepine derivative family; 2) the half-life-time in the serum is extremely short, namely 1-2 hours; 3) they increase the level of slow waves (delta-wave) during sleep; 4) they have a lesser effect toward atonic muscle and amnestic thought and behavioral disturbance as compared to conventional hypnotics; and 5) the risks of developing drug tolerance and reciprocal negative effects with alcohol are smaller. Consequently, we can expect that these new hypnotics will bring a certain advantage, especially regarding the avoidance of hypnotics-induced side effects in the course of clinical treatment of insomnia in the future.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock, is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frightening/scary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened. PTSD is a long-life effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions, leading to the production of feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and horror in the person. There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD, such as physical, mental, or sexual assault at home or working place by others, unexpected death of a loved one, an accidental event, war, or some kind of natural disaster. Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person. Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing trauma, abusive or bad relationships. Various drugs which are used for the treatment of PTSD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, etc.); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and isocarboxazid); mood stabilizers (Divalproex and lamotrigine); atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and quetiapine), etc. In this review, we have covered the different risk factors, case studies related to various treatment options with different age group of peoples with PTSD and their effects on them. We have also covered the symptoms and associated disorders which can play a key role in the development of PTSD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: The negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an impairment of normal emotional responses, thought processes and behaviors, and include blunting or flattening of affect, alogia/aprosody, avolition/apathy, anhedonia, and asociality. Negative symptoms contribute to a reduced quality of life, increased functional disability, increased burden of illness, and poorer long-term outcomes, to a greater degree than positive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are prominent and persistent in up to 26% of patients with schizophrenia, and they are estimated to occur in up to 58% of outpatients at any given time. Negative symptoms respond less well to medications than positive symptoms, and to date treatment options for negative symptoms have been limited, with no accepted standard treatment. Modest benefits have been reported with a variety of different agents, including second-generation antipsychotics and add-on therapy with antidepressants and other pharmacological classes. Recent clinical research focusing on negative symptoms target novel biological systems, such as glutamatergic neurotransmission. Different approaches include: enhancing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function with agents that bind directly to the glycine ligand site or with glycine reuptake inhibitors; influencing the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3) with positive allosteric modulators; and stimulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In conclusion, the lack of clearly efficacious pharmacological treatments for the management of negative symptoms represents a significant unmet need, especially considering the importance of these symptoms on patient outcomes. Hence, further research to identify and characterize novel pharmacological treatments for negative symptoms is greatly needed.

      "abstract": "Review question/objective The primary objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesise the best available evidence on the effect of anaesthetic on the physiological aspects of swallowing (rate, strength, and risk of laryngeal penetration or aspiration) as well as client pain and/or discomfort in adults undergoing Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). This procedure is also described as Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory testing (FEESS or FEESST) and Videoendoscopic Evaluation of Dysphagia (VEED). Background Dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing disorder. Aetiologies include medical (respiratory illness, medications, general deterioration), neurological or neuromuscular (cerebrovascular accident [CVA], dementia, progressive disease such as Motor Neurone Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease), congenital (cerebral palsy, cleft palate, intellectual disability), traumatic (brain injury, structural change, damage or cancer surgery, radiation therapy), psychiatric, psychological, functional (no known aetiology) and oesophageal structural deformities. 1 Oropharyngeal dysphagia may be described as a ‘sensation that solids or liquids are not being swallowed correctly’. 1(p. 339) Patients may also have symptoms such as coughing, choking, or a feeling of material still in their throat. Impaired swallowing is a problem because it may lead to significant medical conditions such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, and weight loss. 2 The FEES is a procedure which allows visualisation of the anatomical structures involved in swallowing. This technique allows assessment of swallow competency, diagnosis of pharyngeal dysphagia, and laryngeal penetration of food or fluids. 3-5 FEES gives a ‘real time’ evaluation, and allows for trialling techniques and modifications of food and fluids to determine therapy strategies for safe swallowing that work for that particular client. It does not expose the client to ionising radiation associated with Modified Barium Swallow (MBS) and provides immediate information about the efficiency of the protective cough reflex. 1, 4-6 The FEES procedure is typically undertaken by speech pathologists and otolaryngologists (Ear Nose and Throat specialists) to evaluate and diagnose swallowing disorders/competence. It involves the transnasal introduction of a flexible nasendoscope through the nose and into the hypopharynx. Food or fluid is then introduced orally and the pharyngeal phase of swallowing process observed. 6 The FEES procedure is an assessment tool designed to aid patients with swallowing difficulties. Figure 1 (adapted from 7) presents a schematic diagram of the flexible nasendoscope placement during the FEES procedure.Figure 1: Illustration of laryngoscope placement during the FEES procedure, adapted from 7During FEES swallowing function is evaluated using anatomical and functional criteria. Food and/or fluid are introduced and there is an evaluation of any premature spillage of the bolus into the pharynx or larynx, whether there is a risk of penetration or aspiration of the bolus before the swallow is triggered. Once the swallow has been completed, evidence of residue within the hypopharynx, or around it, suggests laryngeal or pharyngeal weakness. Evidence of bolus in the trachea is an indication of aspiration. Multiple swallows for each bolus may indicate weakness of the tongue base or posterior pharyngeal wall. 1, 8, 9 FEES allows a physical examination of structural movements during a swallow of different foods and liquids. Interventions, which commonly include dietary and/or behavioural modifications, are prescribed to lessen swallowing difficulty if swallow impairment is diagnosed. 9 A ‘competent’ swallow is commonly defined as timely (less than three seconds after oral preparation of the bolus), complete such that the whole bolus is swallowed without pharyngeal residue, and propulsion to the oesophagus occurs, with no penetration or aspiration into the larynx. A ‘competent’ swallow is not effortful and does not generally require double or multiple swallows.8 An accurate result of the swallow evaluation is critical as it facilitates appropriate patient referral and treatment, outcomes that can significantly affect quality of life 9 and health 3. For many years dysphagia assessment and management was conducted using clinical (bedside) assessment, or videofluoroscopic studies (MBS).10 Bedside assessment involves a trial of food and fluids, and an oro-motor examination. The result of a bedside assessment is reliant on the clinician's ability to detect, and evaluate oral and pharyngeal dysphagia and gain knowledge of oesophageal symptoms based on the patient's medical history. When the FEES swallow evaluation procedure is used, there is a visual assessment of what is actually happening which is not possible in the bedside assessment. Calculated evaluations can be made using results from the bedside approach, but a clear diagnosis is often difficult, 11 and even the most experienced clinicians can fail during a bedside examination to identify approximately 40% of aspirating patients. 11Clinical evaluation has its place, however it is problematic in that silent aspiration (i.e. no overt evidence such as coughing or choking when food or fluids enter below the vocal cords) is not detected.4 Scott et al 12 have pointed out that swallowing is a complex activity involving several rapid, integrated movements, few of which could be observed directly which makes evaluating it complex. In addition, a cough can be an unreliable indicator of aspiration.13 Whilst reasonable conclusions can be made with clinical evaluation, there is the danger of inaccurate diagnosis and inappropriate recommendations leading to negative impacts on patient health outcomes and quality of life 3. Videofluoroscopic studies, such as the MBS, have been used for diagnosis and evaluation of dysphagia since the 1980's. 8 This procedure evaluates the oral phase, pharyngeal phase and the oesophageal transit. Small amounts of food and liquid (with barium paste) are introduced and followed radiographically from mouth to the lower oesophageal sphincter. This procedure is carried out in a radiology suite, with a radiologist and radiology technician present, and generally a speech pathologist. It requires the patient to be able to sit upright. At times this precludes very ill patients and those who find the physical demands of the procedure too difficult. 8 The FEES procedure was formalised by Susan E Langmore in the late 1980's. Its introduction was a “collaborative effort” 8(p. 1386) between the specialties of speech pathology and otolaryngology. Prior to this development, otolaryngologists had largely screened patients and diagnosed swallowing disorders 8. Langmore identified the clinical usefulness of FEES for analysis of function as compared with medical pathology which would only allow assessment of anatomical not functional pathologies. The advantages of FEES over MBS include its portability and easy access for physically disadvantaged patients, the lack of need for a radiology suite (and radiologist), its relative cost-effectiveness, no radiation exposure (and therefore any amount of time can be used to determine a diagnosis), the ability to directly visualise and record the pharynx and larynx, and its sensitivity in detection of and severity rating of aspiration. 3, 5, 6, 14 FEES is the evaluation of choice where a patient is compromised by radiation necessary for the MBS, and especially where repetitive examinations are required, for example for biofeedback. During FEES the food and fluid is dyed with colour to enhance visibility. At times, the end of the scope can become covered with oropharyngeal secretions or food or fluid, although this can be easily cleared by an experienced endoscopist using techniques to slightly change the position of the scope to clear the residue. In addition, during swallowing the endoscope will be momentarily pushed against the posterior pharyngeal wall, causing ‘white-out’ (this occurs for about half a second). 11 Some clinicians may consider this a disadvantage of FEES, as visual recording, or observation, is briefly lost. The risk of complications with FEES is regarded as low, but may include: a reaction to the anaesthetic, laryngospasm, epistaxis (nosebleeds), fainting, laryngospasm. 9 Hence, the availability of medical response if required is necessary when performing a FEES. Swallowing function includes three main phases, namely the oral, pharyngeal and oesophageal phase. Dysphagia may occur in any one of these phases 1 and in individuals of any age.14 FEES effectively evaluates the pharyngeal phase and any laryngeal penetration and aspiration (liquid or food going into the ‘wind pipe’).1, 6, 8, 11 However, it is unable to evaluate either the oral or oesophageal swallow phases as the scope is passed through the nasopharynx (nose and back of the throat). FEES is effective at identifying silent aspiration 3, which may be defined as entry of the bolus below the level of the true vocal folds without any external behavioural signs such as coughing or choking. 4 Speech pathologists have specific training to make recommendations about a safe diet and fluid consistency for a dysphagic client to swallow. Based on the outcomes of the FEES procedure, they can be more certain of the efficacy of their recommendations. The recommended foods and fluids may need to be modified in consistency depending on the evaluation of dysphagia, thereby affecting quality of life of the client. FEES is important in that it facilitates a more precise determination of the food and fluids safe for swallowing as the procedure allows visualisation of the client swallowing those actual consistencies.3, 15, 16 This is why it is important to understand whether the use of anaesthetic during FEES affects the accuracy of the swallow function diagnosis. During FEES the thin flexible nasendoscope is introduced into the client's nose and then passed through to the back of the throat (Figure 1). For accurate placement and prevention of tissue damage, the client is advised to stay still. Anaesthetic is commonly introduced as a means to reduce client anxiety, pain and discomfort and minimise client movement during the procedure. The most common form of anaesthetic introduction is via the application of a topical or spray anaesthetic into the nostril prior to the introduction of the nasendoscope. 1, 10, 15, 17 The use of anaesthetic during the FEES procedure is a topic of debate both in the literature and practice relating to diagnosing and treating swallow function. 2, 18, 19 In practice, otolaryngologists frequently use anaesthetic to evaluate structure whereas speech pathologists are not authorised to use anaesthetic and therefore require the presence of an Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist or other medically trained professional when it is being used. The tendency for FEES to be conducted with anaesthetic, and restrictions relating to which health professionals can administer anaesthetic during FEES limits access to FEES in facilities where there is unavailability of medical practitioners authorised to administer anaesthetic. As is explained in more detail below, the debate on the use of and need for anaesthetic when conducting FEES focuses on whether application of anaesthetic influences swallowing function and the accuracy of the diagnosis of dysphagia as well as anaesthetic's effectiveness for reducing client pain/discomfort and anxiety. The amount of anaesthetic, timing of anaesthetic, use of vasoconstrictor in addition to the anaesthetic and the method of application, have all been shown to vary across research studies and in clinical practice. Types and amounts of anaesthetic as described in the literature include Lidocaine 5, 20 20mg Cophenylcaine, 21 Cocaine, 22 2% Tetracaine.1, 17 Application methods also vary and include being applied nasally, orally, or with a cotton bud 23 or orviaaerosol puff.18 In addition, a vasoconstricting drug may also be applied in order to constrict the nasal mucosa and create a wider space to introduce the scope. 23 The sensation required for efficient swallowing is controlled by three cranial nerves innervating muscles of the mouth and pharynx. These nerves are the trigeminal, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. 2 The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve is regarded as the most important trigger for swallowing. Anaesthesia of areas innervated by these nerves can affect, but not completely diminish, the ability to swallow. This suggests that a person may have a less efficient swallow due to anaesthesia. 2, 7, 18, 19, 24. Aspiration with anaesthesia is described in the literature 18, suggesting increased risk during a FEES procedure if using anaesthetic. 2, 4, 7, 18, 19, 25 Therefore the clinician is potentially disadvantaged in their decision making. Another advantage of using anaesthetic during the FEES procedure, aside from its potential to reduce patient pain and discomfort raised in the debate over use of anaesthetic and FEES, is its potential to allow a more thorough assessment by the endoscopist because it is less distressing for the patient. However, some practitioners are of the view that the scope manoeuvres easily without anaesthetic. A disadvantage of using anaesthetic during FEES, raised both in discussions amongst those using the FEES procedure in practice in South Australia as well as in the literature 2, 20, is that it may cause a patient to experience a bitter taste. The client also has a ‘numb’ sensation for some time after application of the anaesthetic and is unable to drink or eat, because of the risk of aspiration, for around a half hour after the procedure. In the context of this debate over the use of anaesthetic when undertaking FEES it is important to conduct the systematic review proposed to enhance understanding about whether: (i) anaesthetic has a significant effect on the pain/comfort and anxiety experienced by the patient during the procedure; and/or (ii) it effects swallow function and swallow function diagnosis and thereby leads to an inappropriate management plan being recommended. No systematic review has been undertaken to date on the effects of anaesthetic during the FEES procedure. A preliminary search of the JBI Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library, PubMed and CINAHL found no systematic review protocols or reports on this topic. It is anticipated that the findings of this review will be used to enhance endoscopists’ decision making on the use of an anaesthetic agent when conducting FEES.",

      "abstract": "Editor—Sanfilippo syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) encompasses a group of four lysosomal storage disorders resulting from a failure to break down the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate. Each of the four subtypes, A, B, C, and D, is caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme in the degradative pathway of heparan sulphate: heparan-N-sulphatase (EC 3.10.1.1), α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC3.2.1.50), acetyl-CoA N-acetyl transferase (EC 2.3.1.3), and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulphatase (EC 3.1.6.14), respectively.1 Clinical symptoms usually occur after two years of apparently normal development and include hyperactivity, aggressive behaviour, delayed development (particularly in speech), sleep disturbances, coarse hair, hirsutism, and diarrhoea. There are only relatively mild somatic manifestations. There then follows a period of progressive mental retardation with death usually between the second and third decade of life. In a small number of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, there is a more slowly progressive form of the disease with later onset known as the attenuated phenotype.2-4 A late onset phenotype has also been described for Sanfilippo syndrome type A.5 \n\nSanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme heparan-N-sulphatase (sulphamidase). The disease is autosomal recessive and the gene encoding the enzyme is situated on chromosome 17q25.3, contains eight exons, and encodes a protein of 502 amino acids.6 7 To date, 46 different mutations have been identified in Sanfilippo A patients,6 8-13 several of which have been found at high frequencies in particular populations. The R245H, R74C, 1091delC, and S66W were the most frequent mutations in the Dutch (56.7%),11 Polish (56%),8 Spanish (45.5%),13 and Italian (33%)12 populations, respectively.

      "title": "Persistently positive <scp>anti‐NMDA</scp> receptor antibodies in chronic psychotic disorder: foe or innocent bystander?",
      "abstract": "Isolated psychiatric manifestations of Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis have been recognized1 and NMDAR antibodies have been described in first psychotic episodes (FEP).2 Their clinical significance in chronic psychosis is a subject of debate and uncertainty about immunotherapy usefulness remains.3 We present a patient with chronic late-onset psychosis, persistently positive NMDAR antibodies (Immunoglobulin G against NMDAR GluN1 subunit, detected using a cell-based immunofluorescence assay) and no clear response to immunotherapy. A 64-year-old man with a 10-year chronic psychotic disorder and probable diagnosis of schizophrenia, with multiple psychotic relapses and under treatment with quetiapine 800 mg, was admitted to our psychiatry ward with persecutory delusions and auditory and visual hallucinations. He presented negative symptoms and cognitive deterioration and there were no abnormal movements, catatonia, seizures, autonomic instability or respiratory distress. No triggers were reported for relapse. The patient had a probable neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) 7 years ago, while being treated with haloperidol. One year before the current admission, due to a psychotic relapse and a positive syphilis test, a lumbar puncture was performed to rule out neurosyphilis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing revealed normal cell count, increased proteins (0.91 g/dL, normal range: 0.1–0.3), positive NMDAR antibodies and one oligoclonal band. CSF VDRL test and antibodies against non-NMDAR cell surface antigens and intracellular antigens were negative. Serum NMDAR antibodies were positive. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed non-specific white matter hyperintensities probably related to small vessel disease. Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed intermittent slow activity with overlapping abrupt waves, without \"extreme delta brush\" pattern. Blood count, creatinine, urea, liver enzymes, thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels were normal. HIV and hepatitis viruses were negative. Neoplasms were excluded with chest-abdomen-pelvis computed tomography and testicular and thyroid ultrasound. Alpha-fetoprotein and prostate-specific antigen levels were normal. Cognitive assessment revealed significant impairment of attention, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, working memory and language. There was no history of previous infections that could be related to NMDAR antibodies appearance. The patient was treated with quetiapine 800 mg. During current psychotic relapse, CSF testing was repeated, revealing increased proteins (1.01 g/dL), positive NMDAR antibodies and no oligoclonal bands. Serum NMDAR antibodies remained positive. NMDAR encephalitis was considered a possible diagnosis (positive antibodies and warning signs: probable NMS and EEG/CSF abnormalities), despite the atypical presentation and the long course of psychosis. The patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone. After 2 days he became confused and psychotic symptoms worsened, thus steroids were stopped. He was then offered five sessions of plasmapheresis, with no clear clinical benefit. Due to psychosis chronicity, cognitive impairment and no clear response to first-line immunotherapy, it was decided not to proceed to second-line treatments. Quetiapine was switched to olanzapine 15 mg. At hospital discharge, the patient displayed improved positive symptoms, with residual delusions. Cognitive deterioration and negative symptoms persisted. In more than 66% of patients, NMDAR encephalitis presents with acute psychiatric symptoms and usually progresses rapidly to include neurological features.4, 5 While the majority of patients develop this multistage progression, isolated psychiatric symptoms were described.1 Warning signs suggesting an autoimmune etiology include CSF and EEG abnormalities or history of NMS, as reported in this case. Other signs include decreased levels of consciousness or abnormal movements, which were not present.6, 7 An increased prevalence of NMDAR antibodies in FPE has been described, ranging from 3% to 6.5%.2, 8 However, literature regarding the prevalence of those antibodies in chronic psychosis is heterogeneous.3 In a case series of 43 patients with chronic refractory psychosis, three were positive for NMDAR antibodies in serum.9 Data regarding treatment options in patients with isolated psychosis and positive NMDAR antibodies is scarce. In a case series including patients with acute psychosis, positive NMDAR antibodies and no clear neurological involvement, nine were treated with immunotherapy and six achieved symptomatic remission.10 Two patients with long course refractory psychosis did not achieve sustained response. We report a challenging case, as the pathological relevance of persistent serum and CSF NMDAR antibodies (detected at two time points, one year apart) in this case chronic psychosis is uncertain and clear-cut treatment recommendations have not been determined. In our case, the patient had an unclear response to immunotherapy. Doubts remain whether this represents a treatment failure or if NMDAR antibodies were an incidental finding. The authors speculate that lack of response to immunotherapy was due to delay in treatment. NMDAR antibodies may have played a role in the pathogenesis of psychosis and cognitive impairment, being a foe, not an innocent bystander.

Clinical/neurological examination does not confirm any organic basis for the symptoms. Conversion disorders are more frequent in girls than in boys. They are rarely seen below the age of seven. A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered. Multiprofessional assessment and treatment by a neuropediatrician, physiotherapist, child psychiatrist/psychologist and educational therapist may reduce \"doctor shopping\" and contribute to a favourable outcome.",

Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony. Even if it is necessary, to promote a process of disability, whose sentence will be emitted by a judge, who will indicate: the degree of the mentioned disability, the trusteeship regime and who is designated as a legal tutor.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

      "abstract": "Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread psychosocial distress. In addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, there is increasing evidence to suggest direct effects of the COVID- 19 virus itself and the subsequent host immunologic response on Central Nervous System manifesting in the form of wide range of neuropsychiatric complications in both acute and post recovery phase. Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as “long Covid,” is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.",

Poor outcome can be predicted with 100% reliability in the first 3 days after resuscitation in about 80% of patients using pupillary and corneal reflexes and motor response from the neurological examination, cortical responses from somatosensory evoked potentials and EEG. The predictive value of a status epilepticus or serum levels of neuron-specific enolase is uncertain at this time. In contrast to poor outcomes, good neurological recovery cannot be predicted reliably at this time.",

      "abstract": "When a patient taking an antipsychotic is not experiencing symptomatic remission, or is experiencing adverse effects (AEs) that are intolerable or damaging to his or her physical health, a change in medication may be the best path to a good outcome. However, many clinicians are reluctant to switch medications in all but the clearest cases of failure. This reluctance is intensified by the occurrence of AEs caused by transitioning patients too rapidly between agents with different receptor-binding profiles. Emergent antipsychotic-switching syndromes include the \"withdrawal triad,\" comprised of cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and emergent withdrawal dyskinesias (and other motor syndromes). More recently, another element has been observed consistent with an activation syndrome. This activation syndrome may occur as a consequence of switching from highly sedative agents or as a consequence of initial prodopaminergic drive. All of these effects can be minimized by careful planning of gradual switch procedures and judicious use of adjunctive medications.",

      "abstract": "Kejang adalah perubahan fungsi otak secara mendadak dan sementara akibat aktifitas nueron yang abnormal sehingga terjadi pelepasan listrik serebral yang berlebihan. Aktivitas ini dapat bersifat parsial atau general, berasal dari daerah spesifik korteks serebri atau melibatkan kedua hemisfer otak. Kejang disebabkan oleh banyak faktor, yaitu penyakit serebrovaskuler (stroke iskemik, stroke hemoragik), gangguan neurodegeneratif, tumor, trauma kepala, gangguan metabolik, infeksi susunan saraf pusat (SSP) seperti ensefalitis, meningitis. Penyebab lain adalah gangguan tidur, stimulasi sensori atau emosi, perubahan hormon, kehamilan, penggunaan obat-obatan yang menginduksi kejang (teofilin dosis tinggi, fenotiazin dosis tinggi), antidepresan (maprotilin atau bupropion), kebiasaan minum alkohol. Berdasarkan International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) dan International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) pada tahun 1981, epilepsi adalah suatu kelainan otak yang ditandai adanya faktor predisposisi yang dapat mencetuskan bangkitan epileptik, perubahan neurologis, kognitif, psikologis dan adanya konsekuensi sosial yang diakibatkannya. Diagnosa epilepsi ditegakkan melalui anamnesa, pemeriksaan fisik dan electroencephalography (EEG). Umumnya, epilepsi diterapi dengan obat antiepilepsi atau anti konvulsan. Apabila kejang tidak teratasi dengan obat oral, dapat dilakukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan, berupa non brain epilepsy surgery atau brain epilepsy surgery. Di Inggris, diperkirakan 0,5–2% total penduduk, menderita epilepsi, dimana 13% memerlukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan. Studi retrospektif, membuktikan, pengobatan invasif atau pembedahan pada epilepsi yang tidak respons terhadap obat oral, telah berhasil mengurangi serangan kejang. Penatalaksanaan anestesi pada epilepsi merupakan tantangan tersendiri bagi dokter anestesi. Diperlukan pemilihan gas, anestetika intravena dan teknik anestesi yang tidak memicu serangan kejang selama operasi. Interaksi dan efek samping obat anti epilepsi harus diperhitungkan saat anestesi. Anesthesia Management on Epilepsy Surgey Seizures are sudden changes in brain function and activity of abnormal neuron activity causing cerebral excessive electrical discharges.

Caused by cerebrovascular disease (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke), neurodegenerative disorders, tumors, head trauma, metabolic disorder, central nervous system infection (encephalitis, meningitis).

International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) in 1981, epilepsy is a brain disorder that can trigger epileptic seizures, neurological changes, cognitive, psychological and social consequences resulting. Diagnose is anamnesa, physical examnination and electroencephalography. Treated with antiepileptic drugs or anticonvulsant. If the seizures are not resolved, can be invasive or surgical therapy (non brain epilepsy surgery or brain surgery). In UK, 0,5 - 2% suffer from epilesy, 13% require surgical therapy. A retrospective study, prove that invasive treatment has succeeded. Management of anesthesia is a challenge for anesthesiology. Election necessary gas, intravenous and anesthesia techniques that do not trigger a seizure. Interaction and side effects of anti epileptic drugs should be calculated.",

Cognitive functions other than memory, specifically self-awareness, are spared [3]. Marijuana use has been linked to transient global amnesia in some cases [4-6], presumably through the effect of Δ9- Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the Cannabinoid receptors (CB1) that are located presynaptically in the lipid membranes of neurons, which results in neuromodulation with changing the number of neurochemicals such as glutamergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic systems, all of which end up affecting the memory [7].",

Dysfunction of cognition without a change in consciousness may result in various disorders, including aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, executive dysfunction, and memory disorders such as dementia and amnesia. Transient dysfunction of cognition associated with a change in level of consciousness or attention may be due to delirium or confusional states.

Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.",

Plus particulièrement, la réactivité cognitive a été identifiée comme facteur prédictif de rechute parmi des sujets atteints de trouble dépressif récurrent en rémission [2]. Elle est la propension à l’activation des schémas dépressiogènes dans des contextes de stress de moins en moins importants au fur et à mesure des épisodes dépressifs successifs. Elle témoigne d’un style ruminatif de réponse au stress, d’un déficit de contrôle de l’attention et de l’activation excessive d’un processus de contrôle des divergences qui pourraient être l’expression au niveau neuropsychologique des dysrégulations neurobiologiques sous-tendant la vulnérabilité psychique. En effet, cette conception de la vulnérabilité à la dépression soutient l’existence d’un défaut de régulation corticale sur l’activité hippocampique et amygdalienne [3]. Mieux comprendre ses facteurs de risque cognitifs est primordial pour le développement de stratégies de prévention efficaces de la rechute dépressive chez le sujet âgé. La thérapie des schémas et la thérapie cognitive basée sur la pleine conscience (MBCT) sont particulièrement pertinentes concernant ce trait. Les premières études du protocole de thérapie de groupe MBCT pour les personnes âgées montrent que cette intervention non pharmacologique est acceptable et associée à des changements positifs [4].

It causes various health effects such as nausea, sweating, chills, muscle cramping, etc. The effect of this drug can be seen in 3 to 5 hours in the body. A spike in body temperature can be seen in MDMA users that can be fatal as it affects the liver, kidney, and heart leading to death. Addiction to MDMA is not yet proven, however, withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue and depression are noted. MDMA is usually taken via the mouth or snorting in the form of tablets or capsules. This drug is also taken or abused along with other drugs such as LSD, alcohol, and marijuana. MDMA is a scheduled drug with no proven medical use. MDMA causes a surge of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain to regulate mood, learning, memory, stress, anxiety, etc. This chapter discusses the effects of MDMA on the human brain.",

Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family.

      "title": "Lacosamide induced aggression in a patient with seizure disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, The commonest psychiatric side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are aggression and irritability.[1] There are serious behavioral and psychological repercussions caused by the changes in the Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic activity caused by AEDs on certain regions of the brain such as the amygdala, frontal cortex, and hypothalamus.[2] There are modifications in the GABA receptors and GABAergic neurons in an epileptic brain, which cause medications that enhance GABA neurotransmission to potentially trigger or exacerbate aggression, as opposed to their effect of decreasing aggression in subjects without epilepsy.[2] A 23-year-old male patient was admitted to the psychiatry ward with complaints of laughing inappropriately, irrelevant talk, overfamiliarity, over-talkativeness, inappropriate behavior towards women, irritability with the use of abusive language without provocation, and decreased sleep. These complaints have been present intermittently for the last 3 years. The patient was diagnosed with a seizure disorder at 6 months of age. His last seizure was 10 months before admission, after which a significant worsening of symptoms was noted, especially inappropriate laughter, irrelevant talk, and inappropriate behavior with women. Physical examination was unremarkable. Mental Status Examination showed a kempt, cooperative patient, in touch with reality, who laughed without provocation and behaved inappropriately with the examiner, by attempting to undress. During treatment in the hospital, the patient suffered a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the ward. The neurologist also prescribed a tab of lacosamide (LCM) 100 mg twice daily. After 2 days of starting the patient on LCM, a sudden increase in aggressive behavior was noted, in a patient who previously showed no aggressive behavior in the ward or before admission apart from intermittent irritability. The patient broke the railing of a bed and attacked his mother and doctors in the ward, threw a metal stool in an attempt to injure another patient, and was verbally and physically abusive towards relatives, doctors, and other ward staff, requiring chemical and physical restraint. No such aggressive behavior was observed when the patient was previously on carbamazepine (CBZ) and lamotrigine. The aggression was therefore attributed to the addition of LCM and the same was stopped. Following this, the patient's aggression decreased and then stopped within 72 hours. The patient was discharged on: T. Oxcarbazepine 450 mg twice daily, T. Divalproate 750 mg twice daily, T. Risperidone 2 mg twice daily, and T. Clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily. On review after a month, his mother reported no aggressive behavior. While the exact mechanism behind behavioral problems that are seen in seizure disorders is still unclear, its occurrence can be attributed to many factors such as the neuropathology of epileptic syndromes, functional damage caused by the seizure, comorbid developmental disorders, anti-epileptic drugs, etc.[3] The changes that occur in the central GABAergic activity due to LCM play a contributory role in drug-induced behavioral changes.[2] The effects of the CBZ, levetiracetam (LEV), perampanel (PER), and LCM on aggression were studied using the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire in 266 consecutive outpatients with epilepsy. The LEV group had a significantly higher aggression score as compared to the CBZ and LCM groups. Based on these results the authors concluded that LEV increased aggression, while CBZ and LCM reduced aggression.[1] Our patient, however, showed the opposite findings. A thorough psychiatric history and any history that indicates a propensity for aggression must be taken from patients and their caregivers. While this may not stop the prescription of anti-epileptic drugs, drugs that are more likely to result in such behavior may be regulated, while also looking out for these side effects that are considered rare. There is limited knowledge on aggression and personality changes caused by using LCM, requiring further investigation to prescribe appropriate anti-epileptic drugs.

      "title": "Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: The role of mood stabilizers",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with symptoms that extend far beyond cognitive deficits. The most distressing of these symptoms are known as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and include delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggression, misidentification, and sexually inappropriate behaviors. As a result of BPSD, AD patients suffer a poorer quality of life, as do their caregivers.1 Behavioral and psychological symptoms can be so distressing to the caregiver that they are a common reason for families placing their loved ones in long-term care. Approximately 60% and 80% of dementia patients living in the community and in long-term care settings develop BPSD, respectively.1Aggression and agitation are characterized by increased or disruptive psychomotor activity, inappropriate verbal activity, or disorganized motor activity that is not explained by the patient's needs. Often times, dementia patients present with aggression and agitation as well as psychotic symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics have been the most widely studied agents for the management of psychotic symptoms as well as aggression and agitation.1 Despite their noted efficacy for BPSD, their use has been curtailed over recent years due to concerns about an increase in cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with their use. This has led to an ongoing search for other effective pharmacologic treatments for BPSD. Several mood stabilizers including valproic acid, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate have been studied in dementia patients. This paper aims to present the data on the efficacy of mood stabilizing drugs for the management of BPSD.In 2007, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) developed a white paper on the use of antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia for the purpose of treating psychosis and agitation.1 This paper also reviewed the use of numerous other psychotropic drugs in this population. Evidence for atypical antipsychotic efficacy in psychosis of dementia indicated that these agents have modest efficacy. The data are difficult to interpret because these studies often included patients with psychosis and agitation. To further complicate the studies, the primary outcome was often a measure of global psychiatric symptoms, not a rating scale to assess psychosis or agitation only. There have been very few studies evaluating the use of atypical antipsychotics for agitation only. This is partly due to the fact it is difficult to recruit dementia patients with agitation only since it frequently overlaps with psychosis. Agents such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole have reportedly shown some benefit for agitation in dementia patients.Nearly 10 years ago, the FDA issued a warning regarding cerebrovascular events (CVEs) such as strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) associated with the use of risperidone. Soon after, the FDA evaluated CVE's with other atypical antipsychotics and the warning was added to olanzapine and aripiprazole. Furthermore, an analysis of pooled data indicated that the rates of CVEs were 1.9% for patients receiving atypical antipsychotics and 0.9% for placebo-treated patients (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–2.8). Of course there are limitations to these data, most notably of which is that these studies were not powered to evaluate the relationship between drug and adverse events; they were powered to evaluate efficacy. In addition, the definition of CVE is not defined in the studies, nor were these events validated. Lastly, there is likely no difference in the rates of CVEs between typical and atypical agents.In addition to the risk of CVEs, increased mortality rates in the elderly have been reported with atypical antipsychotics. These data led the FDA to issue a black box warning for antipsychotics in the elderly regarding the higher mortality rates, which were mostly due to cardiac or infectious disease. A meta-analysis reported that the elderly mortality rate was 3.5% with atypical agents compared to 2.3% with placebo. Again, there were numerous limitations cited including limited data regarding the circumstances around the deaths as well as controversy surrounding the mortality risk in patients receiving typical antipsychotics.The study known as the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness for Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) evaluated the use of antipsychotics in elderly dementia patients under naturalistic conditions.2 Patients were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of treatment for any reason as well as minimal improvement as noted on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks. Patients reportedly discontinued quetiapine due to lack of efficacy after a mean of only 9.1 weeks compared to olanzapine and risperidone where patients continued treatment for a mean of 22.1 and 26.7 weeks, respectively. Patients discontinued all treatments earlier than placebo due to adverse events.In addition to reporting the efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and agitation, the ACNP white paper also reported on the use of other psychotropic drugs for these symptoms.1 There were three trials that evaluated the efficacy of VPA for agitation or aggression in dementia patients.3–5 Two of the studies were completed in patients with agitation and one with patients with aggression. All three studies failed to show any benefit of VPA over placebo for management of aggression or agitation. Additionally, two trials evaluated the short-term (6 week) use of carbamazepine (CBZ) for agitation. Both CBZ trials were small (n of 51 and 21), and reported mixed results. Total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores indicated that CBZ was more effective than placebo in one study7 but no difference was found in the other.6 Olin and colleagues actually reported that there was a significant improvement on the hostility item of the BPRS but a worsening of the hallucination item in CBZ-treated patients.6 The authors also reported that their study lacked statistical power and that they would have needed 69 patients in order to confirm the findings regarding the total BPRS scores.6Unfortunately, the long-term use of CBZ is limited by its poor tolerability, including ataxia and disorientation, and the risk of significant drug-drug interactions.Since the publication of the ACNP white paper, there has been one further study that evaluated the efficacy of VPA in agitation and aggression.8 This study included patients with moderate to severe AD and were experiencing agitation or aggression based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scores (NPI). Patients had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV)9 criteria for AD, have a mini-mental status exam (MMSE) score of < 15, and an NPI > 8. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Each treatment period was 6 weeks with a 2 week wash-out period. Forty patients were referred, but consent was obtained from only 16. Two patients dropped out prior to enrollment, leaving 14 in the study (8M, 6F). Prior to starting the study, patients underwent a wash-out of current psychotropic medications for a period equal to 5 half-lives of the drugs. Treatment was initiated with VPA 125 mg twice per day for one week and increased to 500 mg twice per day during week two. The dose was increased according to symptom response and patient tolerability to a maximum of 1,500 mg per day. The dose could be decreased, as needed. Loxapine 2.5 mg up to 4 doses per week was permitted as a rescue medication. The primary outcome was the NPI agitation score. Secondary measures were the NPI total score and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Wilcoxon signed ranks tests comparing the change in scores for VPA vs. placebo.The results indicated that the NPI agitation scores decreased for VPA-treated patients and increased for placebo-treated patients (1.43+/−3.87 vs-2.08 +/−4.05, p=0.043). The change in scores for the VPA group represents a worsening of symptoms. Worsening of symptoms was also seen on the total NPI and CMAI scores, but was significant only for the CMAI (NPI p=0.075 and CMAI p=0.039). Twelve VPA patients had adverse effects such as falls (5), sedation (4), thrombocytopenia (2), and loose stools (2). The placebo group had 2 patients with sedation and 1 fall. The conclusion is that VPA was ineffective for agitation and aggression and was poorly tolerated in elderly AD patients.A second study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of VPA for preventing agitation and aggression in AD patients.10 Patients had to meet criteria for possible or probable AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke AND the Alzheimer's Diseaseand Related Disorders Association criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA), have a MMSE of 12–20, and be free from agitation or psychosis as defined by NPI < 1 on items assessing delusions, hallucinations, or agitation. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm flexible-dose study. Patients received VPA for two years in a double-blind fashion, and then had a two-month, single-blind placebo treatment period. The VPA target dose was 10–12 mg/kg and used identical appearing VPA and placebo tablets. The primary outcome was defined as the development of a score of at least 3 on one or more NPI items assessing delusions, hallucinations, and agitation for 2 weeks. Other scales used to assess secondary outcomes included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), CMAI, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living (ADCS-Activities of Daily Living), the Quality of Life-AD, and the ADCS Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The primary endpoint was evaluated using the cox proportional hazards model comparing time to end point in the drug and placebo groups and adjusted for variables such as age, sex, baseline MMSE, total NPI, total CMAI, and ADCS-Activities of Daily Living. All assessments were completed at baseline, and every three months until the 24th month, then at month 26. Five hundred thirteen patients were screened and 313 were randomized. At enrollment, the mean MMSE in both groups was 16.9 and the NPI subscales for agitation, delusions, and hallucinations were < 1.0. The mean modal dose of VPA was 250 mg/day and the mean VPA level at 12 months was 42.7 mcg/ml. Sixty-one percent of VPA and 62% of placebo patients discontinued treatment early. The time to the primary endpoint did not differ between the two groups (p=0.88). Twenty-nine placebo and 25 VPA patients reached the endpoint. The mean change in ADAS-cog scores indicated that there were some differences that favored placebo (VPA 9.4, PLC 6.8, p=0.01). The ADCS Activities of Daily Living scores at 18 months also favored placebo (VPA-19.3, PLC-14.4, p=0.02). More VPA than placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (16% vs 7.5%). This study failed to show any benefit of VPA in preventing the development of agitation, delusions, or hallucinations.Due to the intolerability and drug interactions noted in carbamazepine trials as well as the lack of efficacy reported with VPA, other mood stabilizers have been evaluated for controlling BPSD. Topiramate (TOP) is a viable option secondary to its reported efficacy in controlling irritability and aggression in other psychiatric populations.11 However, there is concern with the use of TOP in the dementia population due to cognitive decline reported with its use.To date, there is only one published, prospective trial of TOP for aggression in dementia patients.12 This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing topiramate to risperidone (RIS) that included 48 patients with mild to moderate severity of AD defined by an MMSE score of 10–26. Patients were included if they had a complaint of behavioral disturbances and had an NPI score of greater than 1 in sub-items relating to delusions; hallucinations; agitation and aggression; and irritability and lability. Topiramate was initiated at 25 mg/day and increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks. Risperidone was initiated at 0.25 mg/day with a doubling in dose every week until target dose of 2 mg/day was achieved. In both groups, the dose could be reduced if adverse events occurred. The mean daily dose of TOP was 44.0 mg and RIS was 1.9 mg. Any improvement on NPI parts 1 and 2 or the CMAI were considered the primary outcomes. Part 1 of the NPI assesses behavioral disturbances and affective and psychotic symptoms; part 2 assesses caregiver burden and distress. Cognitive function was assessed with the MMSE.Forty eight patients were enrolled, but 41 completed the trial. Seven patients dropped out due to adverse events; fatigue and loss of appetite were reported in the TOP group and GI disturbance and akathisia in the RIS group. Both groups showed improvements in the NPI parts 1 and 2 from baseline to week 8. However, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups (NPI part I: P<0.575, NPI part 2: P<0.456). Both groups also showed a decrease in agitation as assessed by CMAI scores but no statistically significant difference noted (P<0.927). Cognitive status on the MMSE was not found to change significantly in either group (P<0.479). In conclusion, the authors found that low dose TOP had comparable efficacy to RIS in treating behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia. However, nearly 15% failed to complete the study due to adverse events.Carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating BPSD, but carries a high risk for adverse events and drug-drug interactions.1 Oxcarbazepine(OXC) has been hypothesized to be efficacious as it has a similar structure to carbamazepine, but with better tolerability. There are case reports suggesting that oxcarbazepine may be beneficial in treating BPSD. To formally evaluate the efficacy of OXC for BPSD, an 8 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial for the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with a diagnosis of AD, vascular dementia, or mixed dementia was conducted.13 This study included patients with moderate to severe dementia as defined by a MMSE of 0–20, a history of agitation or aggression for at least 1 week, a score of 6 or greater on Neurospychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) subscale for agitation and aggression, and were in a nursing home for at least 4 weeks. Patients who were receiving psychotropic medications prior to the study could not have dose changes within 2 weeks before and throughout the study. New psychotropic agents could not be initiated during the study except for haloperidol if needed as a rescue medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive OXC 300–900 mg/day or placebo. Oxcarbazepine was initiated at 75 mg in the morning and 225 mg in the evening with dose increases up to a total of 900 mg/day after 3 weeks with the highest, well-tolerated dose maintained. The mean daily dose of OXC was 536.6 mg/day. The primary outcome was the change in the agitation and aggression subscore of NPI-NH. Secondary outcomes included change in agitation measured by the Brief Agitation Rating Scale (BARS) and change in burden of care measured by NPI-NH.A total of 103 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication with 83 patients completing the study. No significant difference was found between groups for any of the outcomes assessed regardless of whether the intention to treat or per protocol population analysis was used (NPI-NH agitation and aggression subscore P=0.70, BARS P=0.07, NPI-NH P=0.58). Interestingly, there was also no significant difference between groups in the use of haloperidol (P=0.26). The most common side effects occurring in the active treatment group included urinary tract infections, falls, a decrease in serum sodium, ataxia, fainting, and sedation. In conclusion, the study failed to show any benefit of OXC for the management of agitation or aggression in patients with moderate to severe dementia.There have been some smaller, open studies and case studies published on this topic involving other mood stabilizers not already mentioned in this review. A recent case series showed benefit with low dose gabapentin 200–600 mg/day in treating aggressive behavior in seven patients with the vascular or mixed dementia.14 Gabapentin was well tolerated and produced sustained results at follow up varying from 2–6 months.14Lamotrigine has shown to be effective and well-tolerated over six months in a case report of a patient diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia who was demonstrating verbal and physical aggression.15 Another case series of five patients with dementia, manic-like symptoms, and agitation treated with lamotrigine reported improvements on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) after five months of treatment.16 None of the patients had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events.Two small, open-label trials with less than 20 patients each reported the effectiveness of levetiracetam for the management of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Both trials found significant improvement from baseline in the NPI and YMRS.17,18 One report indicated that three patients required a dose reduction of levetiracetam as two patients experienced lethargy and one had an increase in agitation.17 The second study noted that no patient had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events, but did not mention if any dose reductions were required.18Since the publication of the ACNP White Paper in 2007, there have only been three randomized clinical trials studying mood stabilizers for treatment of BPSD. Low-dose TOP and RIS were reported to be equally effective for BPSD. Prospective, placebo-controlled trials of OXC and VPA failed to show any benefit in patients with BPSD. Open trials and case studies have shown some limited effectiveness for gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam and require further evaluation in a controlled setting.Due to a paucity of data indicating efficacy and safety, no mood stabilizer is currently FDA approved for the management of BPSD. If a mood stabilizer is indicated for patients with dementia showing aggressive or agitated behavior, their use should only be considered in cases where the symptoms pose serious risk to the patient or their caregivers. Antipsychotics have the most data indicating some moderate efficacy for BPSD, but their use is associated with serious adverse events, like CVEs, and an increased mortality in the elderly. Carbamazepine also has reported mixed efficacy but is associated with poor tolerability and a risk of drug-drug interactions. Gabapentin, lamotrigine and levetiracetam may hold promise, but further research using placebo controlled trials are needed before recommendations can be made with these agents. Overall, no single pharmacologic agent has shown efficacy and tolerability in the elderly patient with BPSD. Their use should be carefully considered on an individual basis in patients with clearly identified target symptoms followed by close monitoring for improvement.",

According to this theory. a primary neurocognitive dysfunction is the core of schizophrenia and underlies symptom formation, The suggested perceptual fragmentation of external stimuli and inability to connect such perceptions with internal schemata is suggested to lead to positive symptoms, while defensive self-restriction and the exhaustion of the mental apparatus lead to negative symptomatology. Objections to this theory include observations (i) that patients with dominant positive symptoms, e.g., delusions, hallucinations, manifest better neurocognitive function and (ii) that typically antipsychotics significantly reduce positive symptoms and thus improve both the clinical picture and the functioning (to the extent it is reduced with positive symptoms) of the patients, yet have little or no effect on negative, e.g., loss of volition, emotional blunting, and neurocognitive symptomatology, e.g., attentional and memory deficit. The literature suggests that neurocognitive symptoms group independently of other symptomatology. It is suggested that there is currently more evidence against than in favor of the 'cognitive dysmetria' theory.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "Spinal cord detethering without laminectomy or laminotomy",
      "abstract": "Tethered cord syndrome occurs when there is abnormal tension on the distal spinal cord, which limits its elevation as patients grow. This results in stretching of the neural elements and microvasculature, resulting in both direct and ischemic injury.[7] Animal studies suggest that impairment of oxidative metabolic pathways may contribute to neuronal injury.[7] Associated conditions include myelomeningocele, lipomyelomeningocele, intraspinal lipomas, diastematomyelia, thickened/fatty filum terminale, and trauma.[2] Tethering may be asymptomatic or result in a variety of symptoms including lower extremity weakness/sensory deficits, bowel/bladder dysfunction, scoliosis, pes cavus, and back/leg pain.[6] Early surgical intervention has been shown to improve outcomes and may be performed prophylactically or to prevent symptom progression.[1,3] More specifically, retrospective studies demonstrate that surgical intervention in patients under the age of 2 years is associated with improved outcomes.[5] In some cases, detethering may result in clinical improvement.[3].We present a case of a 6-month-old male with a low-lying conus medullaris, lumbar syrinx, mildly abnormal urodynamic studies, and asymmetric utilization of his lower extremities observed during the evaluation of a Y-shaped gluteal cleft. He underwent elective spinal cord detethering via the safe and effective, minimally invasive technique described in the video.The patient's parents gave informed consent for treatment and video recording. Institutional review board approval was deemed unnecessary.Given the variety of surgical techniques used for cord detethering, this video may assist other surgeons in developing techniques that require little to no compromise of the developing bony spinal column while achieving sufficient release of the spinal cord.[4].",

Unter Verhaltensstörungen oder „nicht-kognitiven Störungen” der Demenz versteht man ein weites Spektrum von Verhaltensweisen und Symptomen, die einerseits organisch durch die der Demenzerkrankung zugrunde liegende Schädigung des Gehirns bedingt sind, andererseits gut einfühlbare Reaktionen auf das Nachlassen der Gedächtnisleistung und der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit darstellen. Diese Verhaltensstörungen treten häufig bereits in frühen Stadien des Krankheitsverlaufs auf, noch bevor sich ausgeprägte Gedächtnisstörungen oder Störungen der Alltagskompetenz zeigen. Es sind vor allem sozialer Rückzug, Angst, Affektlabilität und Depressivität, aber auch Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität, Misstrauen oder Aggressivität. Es kann auch zu deliranten Episoden, ausgeprägten Verwirrtheitszuständen mit Desorientiertheit, Verkennungen und Wahnideen kommen.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

In the treatment of serially occurring seizures, diazepam gel administered rectally is effective in controlling seizures.

According to the French law (article 222-15 modifié par la loi n° 2007-297 du 5 mars 2007), a drug-facilitated crime is defined as voluntary administration to a subject of a noxious substance with a mental or a physical effect. Victims can be highly variable, from very young children to very old people irrespective of their social status. As several practitioners (general physicians, emergency doctors, gynecologists, forensic pathologists, police forces) can be involved during the initial claims, it is often complicated to get a suitable reception after an assault. Indeed, drug-facilitated crimes not only involve sexual assaults, but also robberies with trick, workplace or sport competitions or any situation where the sedation of somebody is required (childcare, old people care homes). The most frequent active substances found in these cases include sedative pharmaceuticals (hypnotics, benzodiazepines, anti-histaminic compounds, neuroleptics) and entactogens (ecstasy, synthetic cathinones). Often, the victim's claims are too late to collect blood or urine, and therefore hair tests constitute the best approach to document drug exposure, which is mandatory during trials at criminal courts.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

      "title": "Alteraciones estructurales de las regiones cerebrales sexuales tras empleo de paroxetina versus agomelatina",
      "abstract": "El estado de animo del individuo es un tono vital interno dominante y mantenido, que influye en el comportamiento de la persona y en su percepcion del mundo. Este puede verse normal o eutimico, elevado o hipertimico; bajo o deprimido. Las alteraciones de la esfera afectiva son un grupo de afecciones clinicas que se caracterizan por la perdida de ese sentido del control y por el sentimiento subjetivo de un gran malestar. (SINTOMAS) Los pacientes con animo deprimido experimentan una perdida de energia y del interes, sentimientos de culpa, dificultades de concentracion, perdida del apetito, pensamientos de muerte… entre otros sintomas. Los trastornos del espectro depresivo, cuentan actualmente con una extensa farmacopea, centrados fundamentalmente por los psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos. Tanto el propio deterioro animico asi como su tratamiento pueden traer consigo un sintoma adicional, la disfuncion sexual (DS). Los Inhibidores Selectivos de Recaptacion de Serotonina (ISRS) provocan una amplia variedad de DS, desde las mas habituales como descenso en la libido, disminucion de la excitacion y retardo en el orgasmo, a otras mas anecdoticas como priapismo (en pene y clitoris), anestesia genital, anestesia peneana, ereccion, orgasmos y eyaculacion espontaneos, aumento de la libido, orgasmos dolorosos… (F. Arias et al, 2000). A pesar de todo, en las fichas tecnicas, la incidencia de la disfuncion sexual se establece entre 2-16%, muy inferior a la estimada en la practica real (Montejo AL, 2001). A modo de resumen, podemos concluir que existe bibliografia que justifica la DS provocada por los antidepresivos (concretamente los ISRS) en seres humanos, no obstante con las limitaciones: 1) Los pacientes con Trastorno del espectro depresivo pueden presentar en si mismo DS como sintoma de la enfermedad. 2) Los pacientes pueden presentar comorbilidad que de lugar a DS. 3) La infraestimacion de la DS debido a la dificultad que supone recoger en una historia clinica reglada la sexualidad como ritmo biologico esencial. Es por eso que creemos que es esencial dar un paso mas y buscar a nivel biologico, que es lo que se modifica a nivel estructural en la esfera, tras el empleo de psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos, concretamente comparando un ISRS con un antidepresivo melatoninergico. Para ello creemos que es una herramienta muy util el estudio anatomopatologico del Sistema Nervioso Central de animales de experimentacion. Trabajando sobre las areas cerebrales implicadas en la sexualidad. Nuestra hipotesis de trabajo se basa en que la Paroxetina produce disfuncion sexual y la Agomelatina no, por tanto las regiones cerebrales estudiadas en los animales a los que se les administro Paroxetina mostraran diferencias con respecto a los animales a los que se les administro Agomelatina. La descripcion de dichas diferencias podria dar lugar a las bases que expliquen de forma estructural la disfuncion sexual producida por un ISRS. Para la realizacion de nuestro trabajo hemos utilizado como animal de experimentacion un total de 20 ratas de la raza Wistar que al inicio del tratamiento tenian aproximadamente 50 dias (postpuberales); y un peso aproximado de 150 gr. Esta camada de ratas se divide en 4 grupos: dos experimentales y dos controles. 1) Animales del Grupo control 1 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. No se administra ninguna sustancia. 2) Animales del Grupo control 2 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. Se admInistra HMC. 3) Animales del Grupo experimental 1 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Paroxetina. 4) Animales del Grupo experimental 2 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Agomelatina. A todos los animales se les expuso a un ciclo de luz-oscuridad de 12 horas a traves de un punto de luz y un temporizador y se les administro las sustancias correspondientes a lo largo de 28 dias naturales. Se realizo un pesaje de los animales en tres momentos del estudio: al inicio, en el dia 14 y en el dia 28. Pesamos la jaula con animales y sin animales, hallamos la diferencia y hacemos un promedio del peso. A lo largo de los 28 dias se realiza un diario de conducta: conductas extranas, psicomotricidad, subida en patas traseras, olfateo general, olfateo anal, intromisiones, etc. Tras 28 dias de administracion de las sustancias; se procede al sacrificio e inclusion de muestras. Tincion mediante la tecnica inmunohistoquimica con los anticuerpos murinos: • Anticuerpo Tiroxina-Hidroxilasa (TH): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Receptor alfa de Estrogenos (RE-a): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Oxitocina (OXT): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/500 RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION (DIARIO DE CONDUCTA) En el grupo de las ratas a las que se les administro Paroxetina se produjo un importante incremento de peso en comparacion con el grupo al que se le administro Agomelatina. Las primeras doblaron su peso y las segundas experimentaron un incremento del 40% del peso corporal aproximadamente. Estos cambios de peso dieron lugar al reajuste de dosis. En el grupo de Paroxetina llamaba la atencion el intenso apetito que mostraban a partir del dia 10 del estudio. En comparacion con los otros grupos de estudio mostraban una importante voracidad. Ademas mostraban un incremento de la actividad motora que se mostraba en subidas sobre patas traseras y olfateo general. A pesar de todo esto era un grupo de ratas muy colaboradoras, que no mostraban resistencia ni a ser manipuladas ni a la administracion del farmaco. Respecto al grupo de Agomelatina mantenian un apetito estable. La psicomotricidad solo se veia incrementada en el momento de la manipulacion, que comenzaban a dar vueltas alrededor de la jaula. Se mostraban parcialmente colaboradoras a la manipulacion y a la administracion del farmaco, con una conducta ambivalente e imprevisible, en ningun momento agresiva. Los grupos control mantuvieron un apetito estable, no sufrieron incremento ni descenso de peso. Respecto a la psicomotricidad no hay hallazgos destacables. RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION A MICROSCOPIO OPTICO .-Sistema dopaminergico: descenso marcado y global en todo el sistema dopaminergicos (desde origenes hasta destinos) en los animales tratadados con Paroxetina comparado con los animales tratados con Agomelatina y los animales control; que fue objetivado mediante el tratamiento estadistico de los datos obtenidos a traves del programa de procesamiento digital ImageJ. .-Sistema oxcitocinergico: no se observan diferencias significativas entre los grupos de estudio .-Sistema receptor alfa de estrogeno: se observa descenso de RE alfa en la pars tuberalis de los animales tratados con Agomelatina.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling or remaining asleep with associated daytime consequences. It is among the most common clinical complaints in the general adult population. The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

An addictive drug that mimics or blocks a neurotransmitter or receptor is like a weight thrown suddenly onto one side (let’s call it the drug side) of a balanced seesaw. The sum of all the adaptations is like a counterweight added slowly to the opposite side (the adapting side) until the level state is reached again. If a drug floods the brain suddenly (a drug spike), an immediate change in brain function results. In the vernacular, if this effect is hedonic (pleasurable), it is called a drug “high;” the drug side of the seesaw drops. If the same drug is trickled slowly into the brain instead of spiking, adaptations can occur even while the drug level is increasing; the “high” is muted or nearly absent, while a plateau drug level is established.",

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

      "title": "Microdosing psychedelics in the treatment of ADHD and comorbid disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Microdosing psychedelics has garnered considerable attention within both nonprofessional circles and the scientific community in recent years. This method involves taking small, non-hallucinogenic doses of substances like LSD or psilocybin over weeks or months, purportedly to enhance specific behaviors, emotions, or address psychiatric conditions. Exploring these assertions is crucial given the potential therapeutic value of microdosing, especially in conditions that respond positively to full psychedelic doses, such as depression. The full psychedelic experience might not always be suitable due to various factors like age, capacity to consent or comprehend the experience (e.g., dementia), or individual personality traits that might hinder surrendering to the experience. Microdosing could potentially serve as a maintenance therapy post-full dose administration, aiding specific psychological or biological processes during therapy or therapeutic exercises. Recent studies in healthy individuals highlight that small psychedelic doses have nuanced effects on pain perception, mood, neuroplasticity, sleep duration, brain connectivity, and default mode network synchronicity. However, some parameters show null effects after both single and repeated administration. Our survey research uncovered that individuals with ADHD reported symptom relief through microdosing, deeming it more effective than their conventional treatments. Subsequently, we conducted a naturalistic study following individuals with ADHD across a 4-week microdosing period. Our findings indicated a reduction in symptoms over time, an increase in trait mindfulness, and a decrease in neuroticism compared to baseline. While these results are intriguing, they necessitate validation in a clinical trial. We have recently concluded such a trial and are currently analyzing the data to further explore these effects.

No obstante, estas pueden ser reflejo de un proceso patológico cerebral que provoca deterioro progresivo de las funciones cognitivas en perros geriátricos. Recientemente, fue descrita una enfermedad conocida como Síndrome de Disfunción Cognitiva de perros senior o “enfermedad de Alzheimer del perro”, debido a las similitudes clínicas y patológicas con esta enfermedad en humanos. Los animales afectados desarrollan cambios morfofuncionales en diferentes zonas cerebrales, lo que probablemente conduce a la aparición de cambios asociados al decline cognitivo, es decir, disminución en la capacidad de recopilar información, procesarla, retenerla y tomar decisiones, lo que termina provocando efectos deletéreos sobre la calidad de vida del paciente afectado al no lograr desenvolverse normalmente en su medio. Dada la inespecificidad de los signos clínicos, la anamnesis y los test comportamentales han sido considerados como las principales herramientas diagnósticas para identificar este síndrome.

      "abstract": "In autoimmune diseases, also called connective tissue diseases, many systems and organs are involved, including the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system. The frequency of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations varies in certain autoimmune diseases. One of the most common causes of these symptoms are vascular pathologies, including inflammatory and thrombotic, immunologic and atherosclerotic changes. Neuropsychiatric complications may present as a single symptom or might form a syndrome. In a particular patient, a syndrome might change its form in time, presenting itself as a different syndrome. Quite a lot of these symptoms are not a result of a disease itself but its treatment, metabolic abnormalities, arterial hypertension or infection. Steroids play a particular role in the induction of these complications. The role of increasingly used biological agents is uncertain. The most frequent psychiatric manifestations of the connective tissue diseases are: benign behavioural changes, emotional instability and sleep impairment. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are most frequently seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (up to 80% of these patients), particularly with the co-existent antiphospholipidsyndrome. Psychoses with or without seizures are included in the diagnostic criteria of the disease. A separate clinical problem is an induction of a synthesis of autoantiobodies by some drugs, including psychiatric drugs. These antibodies induce clinical symptoms of an autoimmune disease only in some patients, most frequently the symptoms of lupus erythematous, co called: drug induced lupus, including arthralgia, myalgia, fever, skin lesions and serositis. The diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric complications of autoimmune diseases is quite complicated. It is extremely important to distinguish whether a particular symptom is primary to the disease itself or secondary to its treatment. The most important recommendations are treatment of the underlying disease, its exacerbations and chronic phase, and prevention and treatment of vascular problems.",

This is one area in which expensive investigations are difficult to perform and frequently unhelpful. The challenges are:\n\n\n\nAlthough “confused” or confusional state are convenient descriptions to apply to a patient, they do not have a precise medical meaning and are best avoided as diagnostic terms. The term delirium is much better defined and accepted in the classification of mental disorders. It has been defined as: “an aetiologically non-specific organic cerebral syndrome, characterised by concurrent disturbances of consciousness and attention, perception, thinking, memory, psychomotor behaviour, emotion and the sleep-wake cycle”.\n\nAn apparently “confused” patient may have an alternative diagnosis such as dysphasia, dementia or psychiatric disorder.\n\nDelirium, as defined above, includes a range of different behaviours and may be subdivided into hyperactive or agitated delirium, and hypoactive or quiet delirium.

Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described. Good sleep should be understood as a substrate for psychological health and a reasonable expectation in later life.",

      "title": "KNOWING DEPRESSION AND PHARMACOLOGICAL, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES FOR ITS TREATMENT",
      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

Esta forma parte de un grupo de enfermedades conocidas como encefalopatias espongiformes transmisibles (EET) o enfermedades prionicas, que son causadas por la acumulacion de la proteina prionica patologica (PrP) en el sistema nervioso central, y que se puede producir de forma esporadica, hereditaria o adquirida. Los sintomas suelen comenzar alrededor de 60-70 anos y a medida que avanza la enfermedad el dano neuronal progresivo debido a los depositos de PrP conduce a un deterioro mental mas pronunciado, a la aparicion de trastornos del movimiento, ceguera y coma, alcanzando una tasa de mortalidad alta (90%) dentro del primer ano.\n\nSe presenta un caso de una mujer de 65 anos de edad, que acude a urgencias por alteracion del lenguaje progresivo y postura anormal en su brazo derecho, que habia comenzado un mes antes. Despues de detallados examenes clinicos y neuropsicologicos se sospecho de la ECJ y se completo el estudio con examenes complementarios tales como EEG, puncion lumbar y resonancia magnetica del cerebro. La paciente presento deterioro cognitivo rapido y global, lo que le lleva a la muerte 2 meses despues del ingreso. El estudio anatomopatologico posterior confirmo el diagnostico de ECJ.\n\nEs importante conocer la enfermedad para poder proporcionar una atencion de enfermeria adecuada.

      "abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), historically referred to as pseudoseizures or hysterical seizures, are sudden disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, or emotional functions that can mimic epileptic seizures. PNES have a psychologic etiology related to dissociative disorders or conversion disorders, as opposed to the abnormally excessive neuronal activity found in epileptic seizures. Psychosocial conflicts are essentially converted into physical symptoms, resulting in seizure-like symptoms. This case report presents a 42-year-old male with a past history of child abuse, drug abuse, schizoaffective disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was admitted to the behavioral health unit with recurrent seizure-like episodes. These episodes were witnessed in the ED, however, appropriate workup failed to confirm abnormal neural activity or evidence of any brain injury. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric service where he was monitored for additional epileptic activity using long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (LT-VEEG). While subsequent clinical events that resembled epileptic seizures were observed, the LT-VEEG failed to identify any epileptic activity. A diagnosis of PNES was established and a decision was made for the patient to remain on his current antiepileptic, psychiatric, and diabetes medications during his hospitalization. He showed gradual improvement during his stay and confirmed an understanding of his diagnosis. He was released three days later with instructions for follow-up and continued treatment with his outpatient psychiatrist. Early therapeutic counseling in patients who have a differential diagnosis of PNES should be considered to help identify and address the underlying causes of the seizure activity in an effort to curtail these seizure-like events.",

It is part of borderline personality disorder (a disorder characterized by emotional lability and ill‐considered, self‐harming acts); antisocial personality disorder (characterized by rash, ill‐thought out acts that often harm others); attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (characterized by difficulty waiting one's turn and persevering on tasks); bulimia nervosa (characterized by binge eating and subsequent purging); alcohol and drug‐use disorders; and a whole set of impulse‐control disorders, such as kleptomania, pyromania, and intermittent explosive disorder.

Kategorija „neurokognitivni dijeli se u tri cjeline: delirij, veliki neurokognitivni poremecaj, blagi neurokognitivni poremecaj. Delirij se prema DSM-5 dijagnosticira na temelju smetnje pažnje i svijesti (smetnje svijesti u DSM-IV) uz prisutnost neke dodatne smetnje kognicije, nastaje tijekom kratkog vremenskog razdoblja radi intoksikacije psihoaktivnom tvari/lijekom, zbog sindroma sustezanja od psihoaktivne tvari/lijeka ili zbog drugog, zdravstvenog stanja i ove se smetnje ne mogu objasniti nekim drugim neurorazvojnim poremecajem koji je od ranije prisutan ili je u razvoju. Veliki i blagi neurokognitivni poremecaji mogu biti razvrstani u etioloske podtipove (Aizheimefova bolest, degeneracija frontotemporalnog režnja, bolest Lewyjevih tjeiesaca, nanulama bolest, traumatska ozljeda mozga, uzimanje psihoaktivnetvari/lijeka, infekcija HlV-om, Prionska bolest, Parkinsonova bolest, Huntingtonova bolest, zbog drugog zdravstvenog stanja, visestruke etiologije, nespecificiran).

      "title": "Stress and immunity: minireview.",
      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

      "title": "Neurological Disorders in Medical Use of Cannabis: An Update",
      "abstract": "Medical cannabis is increasingly used as a treatment or adjunct treatment with different levels of efficacy in several neurological disorders or related symptoms (such as multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, Tourette's syndrome, Huntington's disease, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, headache), as well as in other medical conditions (e.g. nausea and vomiting, glaucoma, appetite stimulation, cancer, inflammatory conditions, asthma). Nevertheless, a number of neurological adverse effects from use of medical cannabis on the short- and on the longterm have been reported, in addition to other adverse health events.It has been noticed that the use of medical cannabis can lead to a paradoxical effects depending on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -like cannabinoids the preparation contain. Accordingly, some neurological disorders or symptoms (e.g. multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache) may be caused or exacerbated by the same treatment supposed to cure them. The current review presents an update of the neurological adverse effects resulting from the use of cannabis for medical purposes, highlighting the need to weigh the benefits and risks, when using cannabinoidbased treatments.",

      "abstract": "Akathisia is a syndrome characterized by the unpleasant sensation of \"inner\" restlessness that manifests itself in the inability of sitting still or not moving. Many types of medicaments can cause akathisia as an adverse event of their use and they include: antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, antihistamines, and psychoactive substances. We will present the case of a 50 year old patient, treated on two occasions for psychotic depression. During the second hospitalization it is possible that antipsychotic treatment combined with an antidepressant caused akathisia or there were symptoms of agitated depression and akathisia present at the same time, which is very difficult to determine in everyday clinical practice. We can conclude that in this case, as in many others, akathisia as a possible adverse effect of psychopharmacs was very hard to identify. Therefore, it is necessary to have akathisia in mind when using certain medicaments, especially when combining several that use the same enzymatic system and consequently raise levels of at least one of them.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment in substance use disorders",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairments in substance use disorders have been extensively researched, especially since the advent of cognitive and computational neuroscience and neuroimaging methods in the last 20 years. Conceptually, altered cognitive function can be viewed as a hallmark feature of substance use disorders, with documented alterations in the well-known “executive” domains of attention, inhibition/regulation, working memory, and decision-making. Poor cognitive (sometimes referred to as “top-down”) regulation of downstream motivational processes—whether appetitive (reward, incentive salience) or aversive (stress, negative affect)—is recognized as a fundamental impairment in addiction and a potentially important target for intervention. As addressed in this special issue, cognitive impairment is a transdiagnostic domain; thus, advances in the characterization and treatment of cognitive dysfunction in substance use disorders could have benefit across multiple psychiatric disorders. Toward this general goal, we summarize current findings in the abovementioned cognitive domains of substance use disorders, while suggesting a potentially useful expansion to include processes that both precede (precognition) and supersede (social cognition) what is usually thought of as strictly cognition. These additional two areas have received relatively less attention but phenomenologically and otherwise are important features of substance use disorders. The review concludes with suggestions for research and potential therapeutic targeting of both the familiar and this more comprehensive version of cognitive domains related to substance use disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychosis is a severe, acute or chronic mental illness that is characterized by reality distortion, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, catatonia, and impaired insight. Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "A broader palette of safe and better-tolerated agents is available for treating people suffering from chronic schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorders. However, current medical treatments are still only partially effective, and highly-prevalent psychiatric disorders continue to represent a huge personal and socio-economic burden. Most pharmacological agents sometimes induce a variety of severe movement disorders, including dystonia or dyskinesia, with an acute, subacute or more chronic time course. More extensive cerebral condition, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome or the serotonin syndrome may be induced by antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Medications commonly involve dopamine receptor blockers, antidepressants and anti-epileptics, among many others. Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia [1]. The traditional and atypical neuroleptics sometimes induce dystonic reactions, akathisia, parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, tremor, hyperkinesia and movement disorders [1]. A better understanding of the impact of these drug-induced adverse effects may provide new strategies to develop novel neuroleptics with less adverse metabolic effects and to develop complementary medical therapies to patients treated with antipsychotic medication [2]. The lack of success in discovering more effective pharmacotherapy has contributed, together with many other factors, to a relative few useful findings on new drug targets for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in patients with acute or chronic liver diseases are usually summarized as hepatic encephalopathy. Encephalopathy that occurs in the patients with acute hepatic insufficiency or in the terrain of cirrhosis Is defined as acute hepatic encephalopathy. Degree of alteration in mental functions is highly variable. Minor deficits could be measured and detected by sophisticated psychometric or electroencephalometric tests (subclinical encephalopathy). As well as in other organic psychosyndromes hallucinations and confabulations can be present in the same time deficits of attention, emotions, psychomotor behavior, memory, or inversion of sleep wake cycle, which can lead to hepatic coma. In the early stages of hepatic encephalopathy behavior disturbances are usually present, therefore are treated with tranquillizers, especially benzodiazepine anxiolitycs which could precipitate cerebral dysfunction. It is of importance to stress that patients with hepatic encephalopathy are highly susceptible to exogenous and endogenous benzodiazepines, which Is one of the factors of disability of neurotransmission balance. Therefore use of benzodiazepines with long half life in plasma and active metabolites, is contraindicated in the patients with, liver cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy, because of the possibility of progression toward hepatic coma. On the basis of gabaergic hypothesis of pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, benzodiazepine antagonists could be useful in the treatment. Flumazenil which posses high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and is used for that purpose. Severe behavioral disturbances and delirium induced by hepatic encepahlopathy have been successfully treated by our clinical experience with chlormethiazole.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

A search was made through different databases for a mnemonic method regarding alarm criteria in emergency headaches, and methods in English and Spanish were found, but there was no mention of one written in Portuguese. Result With that in mind, the method “RISADA PEGA” (“laughter spreads”, in English) was created: Repentina / (Sudden) I - Início depois dos 50 anos / (onset in a patient older than 50) S - Sinais e/ou sintomas de doenças sistêmicas ou neurológicas / (Signs and/or symptoms of systemic or neurologic diseases) A - Anormalidades no exame neurológico/(abnormalities upon neurologic examination) D - Depressão da imunidade(AIDS, Câncer)/Depressed immunity (HIV or cancer) A - Antecedentes: doenças que podem acometer o SNC; número de vindas ao PShistória familiar de cefaleia)/(Prior conditions: diseases affecting the central nervous system; number of visits to the health center, history of headache in the family) P - Padrão alterado (mudança no padrão anterior da cefaleia)/(change in headache pattern) E - Esforço/exertion) G - Gravidez/(pregnancy) A - Autonomia (sinais autonômicos)/(autonomic signs) Conclusion In the emergency department, an acute headache is a symptom presented by 2%-4% of admitted patients. Secondary headaches are associated with high morbidity and mortality. A need exists for the quick identification of the alarm criteria and a correct stratification of the patient's risk, proper diagnosis and treatment. There are also time constraints in the emergency department. This shows the usefulness of a method for quick identification of the alarm criteria. We believe this is a useful tool for medical education and a clinical aid for clinical practitioners, it may also be a way to educate patients regarding the alarm criteria for emergency headaches.",

Neuroimaging characteristics: T2 hyperintense lesions with little to no enhancement, edema, or hemorrhageh. Prognosis 1) Survival is variable (at least 3-5 years is expected) 2) Most low-grade astrocytomas undergo malignanttransformation with time 3) Risk factors for malignant transformation: tumorsize, gemistocytic pathology, presentation in first decade or after age 50 years, increased enhancement2. Anaplastic (WHO grade III) astrocytoma a. Associated with mutations of the tumor suppressor genep53 on chromosome 17p13.1 (as with the low-grade astrocytomas), mutation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 13q14 in 1/3 of cases, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 19q (the latter two are involved in transformation from a low-grade to an anaplastic astrocytoma)b. Presentation is often between 40 and 60 years of age (younger patients have longer survival)c. Mascroscopic features 1) Diffusely infiltrating heterogeneous neoplasm 2) Tumor may appear cystic and/or contain hemorrhagicfoci d. Microscopic features1) Cellular proliferation is more prominent than in lowgrade astrocytomas2) Often, frequent mitotic figures and endovascular proliferation3) No necrosis e. Seeding of the neuroaxis by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)dissemination and ependymal spread may occur but are rareoverexpression of proto-oncogene encoding plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)b. Occur typically in either first decade or between third and fourth decadesc. Usually hemispheric location, with predilection for temporal and posterior frontal lobes more than anterior parietal lobed. Tends to be infiltrative, with no well-defined borders e. Seizure is common presentation f. Pathology1) Pattern (from most common to least common): often fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic astrocytomas2) Fibrillary astrocytomas (Fig. 16-1) a) Well-differentiated astrocytes with scant cyto-plasm; atypical and hyperchromatic nuclei; fine, fibrillary processesb) Microcysts containing mucinous material c) Scant to absent mitotic figures and vascularproliferation d) Calcification is rare but may occur in up to 10% to20% of cases 3) Protoplasmic astrocytomasa) Hypocellular b) Cells with small round nuclei, sparse cytoplasm c) Prominent characteristic microcystic spaces4) Gemistocytic astrocytomas (Fig. 16-2) a) Large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasmand eccentrically placed nuclei b) Usually worse prognosis c) Malignant transformation: more often than otherpathologic subtypesTable 16-1. WHO Classification and St. Anne/Mayo Grading of Astrocytic TumorsWHO St. Anne/Mayo_______________________________ ________________________________________________________ Designation Classification Grade (based on criteria)* Criteria*f. Median survival: usual estimate, about 2 to 3 years after presentation3. Glioblastoma multiforme a. Most common primary brain tumor, 50% of all gliomas b. Presentation: typically after age 50 c. With the aggressive nature and rapid progression,presenting symptoms include increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and focal neurologic symptomsd. Genetics 1) Secondary glioblastomas (malignant transformationof lower grade glioma to glioblastoma) can be associated with mutation of gene encoding PDGF-α, loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN (LOH at chromosome 10q)2) Primary (de novo) glioblastomas a) Have no apparent antecedent low-or intermediate-grade tumor history b) Are often associated with amplification of theproto-oncogenes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MDM2, loss of tumor suppressorgene PTEN, LOH at chromosome 10, and mutation involving the RB genee. Most common locations: deep white matter and deep gray matter, including thalamus and basal gangliaf. Macroscopic and neuroimaging features 1) Heterogeneous-appearing mass with foci of necrosis,hemorrhage, and peritumoral edema (Fig. 16-3) 2) Neuroimaging often confirms the heterogeneousappearance, with central area of necrosis and a ringenhancing rim3) Despite the circumscribed gross appearance, thetumor is highly infiltrative and may also spread to opposite hemisphere through the corpus callosum (“butterfly gliomas”)4) Glioblastoma multiforme tumors may arise from malignant transformation of separate regions of the tumor and appear multifocal5) Contrast enhancement and vasogenic edema occur from disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB)6) Treatment with corticosteroids assists in reestablishment of BBB and can yield almost immediate improvement of symptomsg. Microscopic features 1) All the features of anaplastic astrocytomas in additionto prominent endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, surrounded by pseudopalisading of cells (Fig. 16-4)2) Neovascularization and endothelial hyperplasia may be due to production of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)h. Natural history and spread 1) Typical: spread of tumor along white matter tractsand around the ependyma 2) Atypical: CSF dissemination through neuroaxis(occurs in 10%-20% of cases), may include pachymeningeal spread3) Almost never occur: invasion of dura mater and metastasis outside of CNS4) Meningeal invasion is sometimes called “meningeal gliomatosis,” occurs more frequently with malignant gliomasi. Treatment 1) Usually includes surgical debulking aimed at relievingmass effect and increasing effectiveness of adjunctive therapy (also sometimes to obtain pathology specimen)2) Complete resection is not possible because tumor is diffusely infiltrative and multifocal3) Stereotactic biopsy: reserved for deep and inaccessibletumors and comorbidities precluding general anesthesia 4) Most effective adjunctive therapy: external beamradiotherapy administered to limited field, up to 60 Gy given in conjunction with temozolomide chemotherapy-median survival, about 14 months; 2-year survival, about 27%4. Gliomatosis cerebri (Fig. 16-5) a.

Treatment 1) Some benefit from chemotherapy (as with PCV ortemozolamide) 2) No role for surgery because of infiltrative nature oftumorg. Brainstem gliomas: likely to be solid, diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas (rarely pilocytic tumor arising from fourth ventricle with “dorsally exophytic” growth, which may portend better prognosis)h. Macroscopic features: unencapsulated, but well-circumscribed (there may be limited degrees of infiltration) heterogeneous mass; may have a mural nodule associated with a cysti. Microscopic features 1) Compact pilocytic arrangements of elongated (some-times stellate) cells admixed with microcystic areas 2) Classic feature: abundant Rosenthal fibers, may beslight nuclear pleomorphism and rare mitoses j. 5-Year postoperative survival: 85% to 100% (95%-100% for cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas) k. Cerbellar pilocytic astrocytomas have the best prognosisof all primary brain tumors l. Treatment1) Maximal surgical excision of tumor 2) Surgical excision of the mural nodule may be3) Marginal benefit from radiotherapy d. 2-Year survival after treatment, 5% to 10%E. Circumscribed Astrocytomas 1. Pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Usually occur in first or second decade of life b. Better prognosis than diffuse astrocytomas c. Common locations: cerebellum (hemispheres &gt; vermis),optic chiasm, hypothalamus, and periventricular area of third and fourth ventricles (Fig. 16-7 A)d. Less common locations: spinal cord (Fig. 16-7 B and C), brainstem, cerebral hemispheres (temporal lobe is most common hemisphere site); tend to occur in older age group (young adults)e. Cerebellar hemisphere tumors: often large cystic, fluidfilled masses appearing hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with strongly (but somewhat heterogeneously) contrast-enhancing mural nodulef. Optic and hypothalamic gliomas: tend to be solid, pilocytic tumorsadequate and cystic wall need not be removed 3) With increasing thickness or enhancement of nodulewall, the cystic wall also needs to be removed 4) Nonresectable tumors or recurrence with malignanttransformation may require adjuvant radiotherapy 2. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (WHO grade II orIII) a. Occur in second or third decade of life (average age atdiagnosis, 26 years) b. Often a history of seizures c. May originate from subpial astrocytes d. Macroscopic features1) Well-encapsulated tumor frequently containing a mural nodule within a cyst2) Often located superficially in temporal lobe e. Microsocopic features1) Large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, some containing lipid droplets2) Nuclear pleomorphism 3) Rare mitosesf.

Treatment1) Often includes complete resection 2) Radiation and chemotherapy often reserved forrecurrent or malignant tumors h. Postresection survival rates: 81% at 5 years, 70% at10 years; relatively benign prognosis 3. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Very slow-growing tumors, always associated with tuberous sclerosis (found in up to 14% of patients with tuberous sclerosis)b. Presentation: usually in first or second decade of life c. Usually originate near foramen of Monro, blocking CSFoutflow and causing hydrocephalus d. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, lobulated redmass (vascular tumor), often calcified and cysticLarge cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilic granular bodies are a characteristic feature of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which is a low-grade gliomae.

Neuroimaging: isointense or hyperintense on T2weighted images; intense, heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted imaging with contrastg. Definitive treatment for symptomatic patients (i.e., hydrocephalus) or extensive tumors: surgical resectionh. Unless symptomatic, patients are only followed with periodic neuroimagingF. Special Considerations 1. Optic gliomas (Fig. 16-8)a. 3% to 5% of all childhood brain tumors b. 2% of gliomas in adults c. Female predominance (female:male = 2:1) d. More common in children: 50% of patients presentbefore age 5, 90% before age 20 e. Tumors involving optic nerve alone have a betterprognosis than those involving optic chiasm (which have better prognosis than hypothalamic gliomas, although aggressive tumors involving optic chiasm may spread to involve hypothalamus)f. Associated with NF1 1) Occur in 1% to 7% of children with NF1 2) As many as 50% of patients with optic gliomas haveNF1 3) Almost all patients with bilateral optic nerve tumorssparing optic chiasm have NF1 g. Slow-growing tumors; malignant histologic features oraggressive behavior are rare (reported in cases of optic chiasm and hypothalamic gliomas)h. Usually pilocytic astrocytomas causing either diffuse expansion without subarachnoid involvement or primary subarachnoid spread with minimal involvement of optic nervei. Symptoms unique to optic nerve gliomas 1) Visual loss, visual field defects, painless proptosis, andsymptoms related to increased intracranial pressure 2) Symptoms of hypothalamic involvementa) Endocrinopathies: precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus, other related endocrinopathiesb) Gelastic seizures: characterized by involuntarylaughter, more common with hypothalamic hamartomasc) “Diencephalic syndrome”: emaciation, cachexia and loss of subcutaneous fat, emesis, pallor, hyperactivity, inappropriate behavior, euphoriaj. Treatment 1) Considered for tumors with aggressive behavior, espe-cially for patients presenting with visual deterioration 2) Radiotherapy considered for patients older than 5years presenting with tumors in locations other than intraorbital (intracranial locations such as chiasmal or retrochiasmal) and when total resection is not possible3) Chemotherapy considered for patients younger than 5 years4) Surgical excision may be limited to biopsy, especially for tumors involving optic chiasm2. Brainstem gliomas a. Account for 10% to 15% of brain tumors in children(&lt;5% of gliomas in adults) b. Age at diagnosis: often between 5 and 10 years c. Heterogeneous group of neoplasms: all grades of pathol-ogy observed, but most are malignant, with poor prognosisd. Symptoms: usually related to ataxia and other cerebellarfeatures, long tract signs, or cranial nerve deficits e. Neuroimaging (can predict prognosis better than patho-logic features) 1) Lesions appear as a high T2 signal with variabledegrees of enhancement 2) May contain a cystic component (Fig. 16-9) 3) Diffuse pontine gliomas: all are malignant 4) Most gliomas involving cervicomedullary junction arelow-grade gliomas 5) Tumors of midbrain usually have a better prognosisthan those involving medulla or pons 6) Dorsal exophytic tumors tend to have betterprognosis f. Prognosis1) Best for focal lesions, dorsal exophytic tumors, low histologic grade, longer period from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, adult age group, and in context of neurofibromatosis2) 5-Year survival: 5% to 30% g. Treatment1) Best: radiotherapy 2) Surgical resection usually involves stereotactic biopsy;is best performed on focal, cystic, or exophytic tumorsG. Rare Astrocytic Variants 1. Gliosarcomas: high-grade gliomas admixed with sarco-ma (variant of glioblastoma multiforme, with same prognosis)2. Gliofibroma a. Glioma admixed with population of cells resemblingfibroblasts b. Usually present in the first decadeH. Oligodendroglioma 1. From cells of oligodendroglial origin (O2A progenitorcells)2. Genetics a. Development of low-grade oligodendrogliomas: associ-ated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p, 19q, and 4qb. Development of high-grade oligodendrogliomas from the low-grade tumors: associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 9p and 10qc. Both are associated with overexpression of EGFR 3. Account for 5% of all primary brain tumors and 30%of all intracranial gliomas 4. May be a male predominance (male:female = 3:2) 5. More often presents in adults: usually present betweenthird and fifth decades 6. Small earlier peak in childhood between 6 and 12 years;thalamic location at presentation is common in children7. Seizures are often the initial presentation in up to 75% of patients because tumor commonly involves cerebral cortex8. Most common location: frontal lobe, followed by temporal and parietal lobes; rarely brainstem or spinal cord9. Slow-growing, infiltrative gliomas: may start in subcortical white matter, tend to spread along white matter tracts and corpus callosum10. Better prognosis than astrocytomas 11. 5-Year survival rate, 75% 12. Mean postoperative survival, 4 to 11 years13.

Homogeneously appearing cells with sparse cytoplasmand round, uniform nuclei c. Cells may appear elongated, with a displaced nucleus;because of fixation artifact, there may be artifactual clearing of the cytoplasm, resembling fried eggsd. There may be mucin-rich microcystic spaces e. Capillaries interposed between uniform-appearing cellsmay form a delicate vascular “chicken-wire” pattern f. Pleomorphism and endothelial hyperplasia (less commonly,necrosis) indicate high-grade oligodendroglioma 15. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous appearing T2hyperintense mass often involving cerebral cortex with variable, heterogeneous enhancement pattern, cystic component, and calcification (in up to 90% of cases)16. Classified into high-grade and low-grade tumors 17. Features associated with high-grade tumors and lessfavorable prognosis a. Contrast enhancement b. Endothelial proliferation c. Mitotic figures d. More than 5% of MIB-1 staining e. Astrocytic component (with oligoastrocytomas, asdiscussed below) 18. Treatmenta. Gross total resection when possible (because tumor is infiltrative, microscopic infiltrates always remain)b. Primary adjuvant therapy: chemotherapy with alkylating agent such as temozolomide (before development of temozolomide, procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine [PVC] were used)c. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 1p or combined loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and 19q (50%- 80% of cases) portend better prognosis, prolonged survival, and better response to chemotherapyd. Although intermediate-grade oligodendrogliomas are often chemotherapy-responsive (e.g., 1p/19q deleted tumors), radiation (often in combination with chemotherapy) is still the mainstay of treatment to achieve maximal survival advantageI. Oligoastrocytoma 1. Composed of different populations of cells, someresembling astrocytes, some oligodendrocytes, and some indeterminate2. A common progenitor cell that differentiates into two different cell lines is likely3. Glial tumors with predominant oligodendrocytic population of cells are often interpreted as oligodendrocytes4. Increasing proportion of oligodendroglial component generally portends better prognosis (chromosome 1p and 19q deletions signify greater sensitivity of tumor to chemotherapy)J. Ependymoma 1. Epidemiologya. 5% to 8% of all primary intracranial tumors b. Age at presentation often in the first decade, with asecond peak in the fourth decade (prognosis worse for patients younger than 3 years)c. Third most common brain tumor in children d. Location (pediatric population): intracranial (90%) orspinal cord (10%) e. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occuring in childrenare infratentorial and about 1/3 supratentorial f. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occur in children (mostlyinfratentorial), and more than 90% of spinal cord ependymomas occur in adults (mostly myxopapillary ependymomas)2. Symptoms at presentation (depend largely on tumor location) a. Intracranial tumors often occur on floor (more frequentthan roof or lateral recesses) of fourth ventricle (medul-loblastomas tend to arise most frequently from roof of fourth ventricle)b. May present with obstructive hydrocephalus and associated symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, nystagmus3. Potential for CSF dissemination: because of close contact with CSF, there may be “drop metastasis” in 5% of cases4. Myxopapillary ependymomas a. Well-encapsulated, indolent, slow-growing vasculartumors arising from filum terminale b. Occur most often in adults c. Associated with good prognosis5. Posterior fossa ependymomas a. Well-demarcated tumors that tend to fill fourth ventricleand extend through foramen magnum b. Appear as T2 hyperintense masses with heterogeneoussignal that may represent tumor vascularity (or necrosis) c. Often a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement6. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-11) a. Sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei and variablecytoplasm among perivascular anuclear fibrillary processes: “pseudorosettes” (fine cellular fibrillary processes that radiate toward blood vessel)b. Myxopapillary ependymomas are characterized by sheets of uniform columnar or cuboidal cells admixed with pools of mucin often bordered by tumor cells and containing a central blood vesselc. Cytologic pleomorphism, necrosis, mitotic figures, and giant cells often signify anaplastic ependymomas7. Treatment: surgical resection and/or adjuvant radiotherapy (optimal outcome with doses between 5,000 cGy and 5,500 cGy) a. Higher survival with gross total resection: goal is toobtain maximal possible resection b. For low-grade ependymomas of spine parenchyma orfilum terminale (myxopapillary ependymoma): surgical resection is mainstay of treatment, radiation is considered if residual tumor is present postoperativelyc. Extensive craniospinal radiation to entire neuroaxis required for patients presenting with CSF disseminationd. Response to chemotherapy is suboptimal; this treatment modality is considered for patients with contraindications to radiation (e.g., children younger than 3 years or patients with recurrent disease )8. Prognosis: generally favorable, especially adults with myxopapillary ependymomas (except for 10%-20% of cases that have CSF dissemination)9. Reduced survival has been associated with young age at onset and anaplastic histopathologic features, and higher risk of recurrence with partial resectionsK. Subependymoma 1. Slow-growing large firm masses most often occurring infourth ventricle, arising from medulla or lateral ventricles attached to septum pellucidum2. Age at presentation: usually between 40 and 60 years 3. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-12): cells with roundnuclei and sparse cytoplasm; admixed with microcystic clusters and foci of calcification on a fibrillary background4. Neuroimaging characteristics: mildly hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images often with heterogeneous appearance and little to no enhancementA. Ganglion Cell Neoplasms 1. Rare, slow-growing, benign well-circumscribed firmtumors often occurring in temporal lobes, sometimes with cystic or calcified foci2. Age at presentation: first 3 decades 3. Most common presentation: seizures (oftenintractable) 4. Predilection for temporal lobes (followed by frontal andparietal lobes); much less common, cerebellum and spinal cord5.

Some neoplastic ganglion cells are binucleated or multinucleated (unfortunately not always present, but quite helpful when present) (Fig. 16-13)7. Treatment a. Resection b. Radiotherapy: reserved for recurrent tumor or thosewith anaplastic histopathologic features 8. Prognosisa. Most carry benign prognosis with total or subtotal resectionb. Anaplastic histopathologic features: less favorable prognosisB. Central Neurocytomas 1. Neoplasms of neuronal differentiation 2. Rare (about 0.5% of all primary CNS tumors), occurprimarily in young adults between second and fourth decades3. Commonly present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (most commonly, headaches)4. Most commonly an intraventricular location, often at foramen of Monro: 50% of all intraventricular tumors in adults5. Microscopic features: sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei; immunoreactive for synaptophysin6. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous signal (isointense or hyperintense on T2-weighted images) with heterogeneous enhancement (Fig. 6-14)7. Treatment often involves resection (total, if possible) 8.

Commonly presents as slow-growing cerebellar mass with increased intracranial pressure2. Commonly presents in the fourth decade 3. Associated with Cowden’s disease (about 50% ofpatients with dysplastic gangliocytoma have clinical stigmata of Cowden’s disease)4. Macroscopic features: hypertrophied, thickened cerebellar folia (Fig. 16-15)5. Microscopic features a. Enlarged ganglion cells (neurons) replace granule cells,atrophy of granular layer b.

      "title": "Epilepsy, cognition, and behavior: The clinical picture",
      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "title": "Stimulants",
      "abstract": "Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Soldiers with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) present with an array of neuropsychiatric symptoms that can be grouped into nosological clusters: (1) cognitive dysfunctions: difficulties in memory, attention, language, visuospatial cognition, sensory-motor integration, affect recognition, and/or executive function typically associated with neocortical damage; (2) neurobehavioral disorders: mood, affect, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and psychosis, as well as agitation, sleep problems, and libido loss, that may have been caused by damage to the cortex, limbic system, and/or brain stem monoaminergic projection systems; (3) somatosensory disruptions: impaired smell, vision, hearing, equilibrium, taste, and somatosensory perception frequently caused by trauma to the sensory organs or their projections through the brain stem to central processing systems; (4) somatic symptoms: headache and chronic pain; and (5) substance dependence. TBI-related cognitive impairment is common in veterans who have served in recent conflicts in the Middle East and is often related to blasts from improvised explosive devices. Although neurobehavioral disorders such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder commonly occur after combat, the presentation of such disorders in those with head injury may pass undetected with use of current diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological instruments. With a multidimensional approach (such as the biopsychosocial model) applied to each symptom cluster, psychological, occupational, and social dysfunction can be delineated and managed.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

Over time, they lead to an important alteration of daily activities (domestic, social, professional) of the person. At present, with life expectancy continuing increasing all over the world and with 10% of the total world population being over 65, the incidence of neuro-degenerative and affective disorders becomes an important concern for specialists. Old age is accompanied by important changes in the person’s self perception and perception of the environment; although depression in the elderly is not different from depression in young age, clinical data have evidentiated a particular type of depressive disorder related to old age, characterized by: motivational deficiency, low concentration and attention capacity, psychomotor impairment, which are frequently accompanied by several organic degenerative diseases. Many times, depression of the elderly is underdiagnosed and remains insufficiently treated. Drug therapy should be associated with psychotherapy, in order to improve patient compliance and motivation. The antidepressants existing nowadays in therapy are more selective and with fewer side effects than the first generation antidepressants: serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertralin), serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (as venlafaxine) are preferred, taking into account the multiple health conditions that may coexist in the elderly patient.",

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

Adolescence is a developmental period when emotions can be extreme when elicited by both positive and negative experiences. The major internalizing disorders are depressive disorders and anxiety disorders; related ones in this domain include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and autism. Treatment effectiveness for teenagers with substance use disorder and a coexisting internalizing disorder is optimized when both domains are addressed. Behavioral-based treatment approaches with concurrent psychotropic medication are part of the treatment plan. One of the most common mental and behavioral disorders among adolescents in the United States is depression. For those suffering from a major depressive disorder, symptoms include a period of at least 2 weeks of a very persistent low mood accompanied with low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, and problems with sleep, energy, and concentration.",

Patient's clinical features may support a specific dissociative disorder subtype diagnosis associated with sleep-related episodes, specifically dissociative identity disorder, dissociative fugue, or dissociative disorder NOS. With any form of sleep-related dissociative disorder, onset can be gradual and sporadic in nature. Females are reported to be affected predominantly, and onset can range from childhood to midlife.

The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: A pseudo- neurological syndrome is observed in institutionalized young children during their initial encounter with the adopting parents and in the immediate period thereafter. The features include: increased neuromuscular tone, oligokinesia, quasi-autistic patterns of interaction, and diminished mouthing behaviors. The signs are confusing to parents and professionals. It's not clear whether to attribute them to neurological impairment or as a sign of a transitional attachment disorder. A tool was needed to rate the severity of the neurological signs and behaviors in order to:1)grade the severity of the psychosocial deprivation prior to adoption, and 2)chart the progress of adjustment and bonding in the new family.",

It is a state of rest for the otherwise active nervous system. It is dened as a state of unconsciousness from which a person can be aroused by appropriate sensory or any other stimulus (1). Sleep duration varies with gender, age and also according to one's daily routine. A lack of sleep, or sleep deprivation (SD), is a widespread phenomenon that can induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. Sleep duration is very important but sleep quality is often ignored factor. Sleep is very essential for learning, memory, attention, alertness, judgement, and overall health of an individual.",

      "title": "Drug Dependency",
      "abstract": "The legal and illegal use of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and hallucinogens, is markedly increasing. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may cause severe acute or chronic symptoms; one cannot predict adverse reactions or relate them to frequency and length of LSD use. Among its effects are acute psychologic changes, including psychosis; and chronic alterations, such as apathy, psychosis, and \"flashback.\" Chlorpromazine is recommended for treatment of symptoms; psychotherapy and education help prevent further LSD use. Chronic amphetamine use may lead to toxic psychosis, confusion, or brain damage; acute withdrawal may lead to depression, with suicidal ideation, and increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with nightmares and insomnia. Chronic use of barbiturates and nonbarbiturate hypnotics may lead to mental impairment, motor incoordination, and depression. Withdrawal produces weakness, irritability, and occasionally convulsions or psychosis. Amphetamines and hypnotics should be withdrawn gradually and patients educated as to possible physiologic alterations, both those patients dependent on large doses and those who have taken therapeutic doses for some months. Withdrawal of these drugs leads to marked increases in REM sleep, nightmares, and insomnia, which may lead to drug dependency. Marijuana may change time sense and visual and auditory perceptions. Chronic use frequently indicates underlying psychologic disturbances needing psychotherapy. Psychoactive drugs differentially affect responses of various autonomic systems. Central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs do not induce only one condition and cannot be simply classified as excitants or depressants. The physiologic alterations produced by psychoactive drugs are basic to drug dependency as are personality factors.",

Nevertheless, bipolar depression does have telltale signs--remembered with the mnemonic WHIPLASHED--to guide diagnosis. (2-8) Worse or wired when taking antidepressants. The patient complains of feeling antsy or being agitated or unable to sleep when taking traditional antidepressants. Look for numerous failed antidepressant trials, apparent tolerance to antidepressants that does not resolve with increased dose, and antidepressant-induced mania or mood cycle acceleration. Hypomania, hyperthymic temperament, or mood swings in a patient's history. Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence. Ask about periods of elevated mood or energy that might not fit formal DSM-IV-TR criteria for hypomania--such as episodes that last only a day or two. Mood lability in younger patients can be especially dramatic and poorly demarcated. Irritable, hostile, or mixed features. Some patients show one or more hypomanic features, such as racing thoughts when depressed. Psychomotor retardation appears more common in bipolar I depression than in unipolar major depression. Psychomotor agitation, however, is more likely in bipolar II than in unipolar major depression. Loaded family history of mood swings, frank bipolar disorder, or affective illness.

In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

Basically, treatment consists of pharmacological and psychological interventions. Although these treatments are effective, not all patients achieve the same results. In this case, alternative approaches are needed to prevent and treat depression. Our literature review shows that high levels of physical activity and exercise have protective effects on depression cases. In combination with other treatment modalities, exercise and physical activity may lead to a more rapid improvement of the clinical picture.

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

The neurobiology of mood and emotionMood can be defined as a relatively lasting emotional or affective state.Mood and emotion differ in that mood lasts longer than an emotion, is less specific, often less intense, and less likely to be triggered by a particular stimulus or event.Mood can be considered a normal physiological affective state generated by the brain.Mood disorders, a pathological emotional state, are disabling disturbances of mood or emotion.They most likely result from a failure to regulate mood (Johnstone et al, 2007).Major depression, for instance, can be described as a failure to regulate negative emotions.This is similar to fear, a physiological emotional state, and anxiety disorder, a pathological state, where a failure to regulate fear circuits leads to anxiety even though objective information about the outside world may indicate that the situation is not dangerous (LeDoux, 2003).Major depression is usually characterized by persistent mood states such as",

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

These can include: (1) early life (e.g., genetic or environmental) factors; (2) physiological factors including increased motor reactivity, visceral hypersensitivity, which may be enabled by postinfectious events, and dysregulation of brain–gut communication (e.g., altered central pain control mechanisms). In addition, psychosocial factors including psychiatric co-morbidity, major trauma (e.g., abuse history), and maladaptive coping may amplify the clinical expression of the disorder and its outcome.

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "title": "Biological treatment of Acute Agitation Or Aggression with Schizophrenia Or Bipolar Disorder in the Inpatient Setting",
      "abstract": "Background Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are chronic illnesses that commonly present with symptoms of acute agitation and aggression. These symptoms must be managed rapidly to prevent potential harm to the patient and others, including their caregivers, peers, and health care workers. A number of treatment options are available to clinicians to manage acute agitation and aggression, including non-pharmacologic behavioral and environmental de-escalation strategies, as well as biological treatment options such as pharmacologic agents and electroconvulsive therapy. We summarize the available biological treatment options for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder presenting with acute agitation or aggression in the inpatient setting, focusing on antipsychotics. Methods The following searches were used in PubMed to obtain the most relevant advances in treating schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with acute agitation and aggression: (agitation, agitated, aggression, aggressive, hostile, hostility, violent, or violence) and (schizophr*, psychosis, psychot*, psychos*, mania, manic, or bipolar) and (*pharmacologic, antipsychotic*, neuroleptic*, antiepileptic*, anti-seizure*, mood stabilizer*, lithium, benzodiazepine*, beta blocker, beta-blocker, alpha2, alpha-2, *histamine*, electroconvulsive, ECT, shock, or transcranial). Individual searches were performed for each drug class. The studies were limited to peer-reviewed, English-language, and human studies. Most were placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses. Results Among pharmacologic agents, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and lithium have been studied in randomized trials. Some typical and, more recently, atypical antipsychotics are available as both oral and short-acting intramuscular (IM) formulations, with 1 typical antipsychotic also available as an inhalable formulation. Conclusions Among the pharmacologic agents studied in RCTs, atypical antipsychotics have the best evidence to support efficacy both in oral and short-acting IM formulations, as well as in one instance in an inhalable formulation.",

Alzheimer hastalığının neden olduğu bu sorunların sona erdirilmesi için erken tanı, tedavi ve özellikle de önlenmesine yönelik çeşitli yaklaşımlara gereksinim vardır. Teknolojinin de ilerlemesiyle dünyada ve ülkemizde çalışmaların artmasına rağmen hastalığın önlenmesi ve kesin tedavisi henüz mümkün olmamaktadır. Ancak Alzheimer hastalığına sahip yaşlı bireylerin günlük yaşam aktivitelerine katılımı ve yaşam kalitesinin artırılabilmesi için ilaç tedavisinin yanı sıra özellikle hastalığın belirtilerini azaltmakta ilaç dışı yöntemler de uygulanmaktadır. &#x0D; Bu derleme, farmakolojik tedavinin yanı sıra Alzheimer hastalarının semptomlarını azaltmak ve yaşam kalitesini artırmak için kullanılabilecek geleneksel ve destekleyici yöntemlerin hemşireler ve diğer sağlık profesyonellerine yol göstermesini amaçlamaktadır.",

Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

      "abstract": "After aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, acute subdural hematoma (SDH) is a rare consequence. SDH has never been linked to an unruptured intracavernous aneurysm. The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "Psychosocial factors affect resistance to a wide variety of diseases in animals. Stimuli often assumed to be noxious (e.g., electric shock, isolation housing) have been found to exert either potentiating or protective effects on an animal's response to potentially pathogenic stimulation. This variability has often been attributed to the influences of these stimuli on aspects of neuroendocrine or immunological function which are related to specific forms of pathogenic stimulation. The impact of a particular form of stimulation on the physiological state of the organism is also determined by the ability of the animal to cope with the stimulus environment. Factors shown to influence have included: (a) other aspects of the immediate environment at the time of stimulation; (b) prior experience with the same or other forms of stimulation; (c) the animal's ability to control its relationship to the stimuli by learning to escape or avoid them; (d) the availablility of relevant feedback regarding stimulus onset (e.g., warning signal), and (e) the stage of the disease process at which stimulation is imposed. These findings by various investigators indicate that it may be inappropriate to place a priori value judgements on any form of psychosocial stimulation or stress either as conceptually or operationally defined. The adaptive value of the psychosocial environment will depend upon its perception by the animal, the animal's ability to cope with the stimulus environment, and the particular disease system being studied.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric illness is common, affecting up to 10% of the population, with around 1% diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder. An increased mortality rate in the postoperative period for schizophrenic patients receiving chronic antipsychotic therapy has been demonstrated. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disease, schizophrenia-associated psychotic disorders are characterized by disturbances in emotional, behavioral and cognitive arenas, impeding on nearly every aspect of life functioning in the form of thought disorders, delusions and hallucinations. Chronic schizophrenic patients lack pain sensitivity, and have pituitary-adrenal and autonomic nerve dysfunction, abnormalities of the immune system, and water intoxication. These alterations may influence postoperative outcome. Psychotropic drugs often given in combination with each other or with other non-psychiatric drugs generally exert profound effects on the central and peripheral neurotransmitter and ionic mechanisms. The increased complications are associated with physical disorders, antipsychotic or hazardous health behaviour and interactions between antipsychotics and anaesthetic drugs. Adverse responses during anaesthesia include arrhythmias, hypotension, prolonged narcosis or coma, hyperpyrexia, post-operative ileus and post-operative confusion. Although drug interaction probably remains the most potentially serious problem current evidence suggests that psychiatric medication need not be discontinued prior to anesthesia.",

      "title": "Sedative-Hypnotics: Addiction and Current Research Status",
      "abstract": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in human and animals. These depressants produce varying degrees of CNS depression, depending mainly upon the dose used. In small doses, they can alleviate anxiety and/or reduce spontaneous activity; in moderate doses, they induce sleep; with large doses, severe CNS depression progresses to anesthesia, coma or even death. This graded, dose-dependent CNS depression is a common feature of these agents. In addition to causing CNS depression, these agents also possess other pharmacological properties, e. g. muscle relaxation, Anticonvulsant activity, respiratory depression, hypothermia, etc. Tolerance-dependence developing to sedative-hypnotics is a common feature following continuous administration of sedative-hypnotics. Tolerance is defined as a decreasing response to repeated administration of the same dose of a sedative-hypnotic or as a necessary increase of the dosage to obtain the initial response. There are two types of tolerance-one dispositional (pharmacokinetic), the other functional (pharmacodynamic). Dependence is defined as a modification of physiological functions that require continuous drug adiministration to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Abrupt withdrawal from long-term usage of these drugs may produce anxiety, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscular twitching, hyperthermia, delirium, tremors, convulsions, and death. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by sedative-hypnotics, e.g benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol, may be mediated through the GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. However, the mechanisms of the actions of these agents on the GABA system remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have receptors which are parts of the GABAA receptors (GABA benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complexes). Although a definitive barbiturate binding site has not yet been identified, the available evidence strongly suggests that barbiturate binding sites and convulsant binding sites are separate but allosterically affect each other. As far as ethanol is concerned, it is likely that multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected. Therefore, it is still unclear how alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are functionally associated with the GABA system. The evidence summarized demonstrates that the GABA synapse plays an important role in the pharmacologic effects of barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines. There are similarities and differences in the effects of these CNS depressants on the pharmacology and biochemistry of the GABA synapse. The effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA synapses are different in different brain regions. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used, (b) brain regions used, (c) protocols used in treating the animals (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) and/or (d) techniques used (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.)",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

Psychological disorder and distress continue to be under-recognised, some disorders are incorrectly diagnosed and treated, and the relative lack of a research base means that nurses and doctors may be treating disorders in their patients without much certainty about the effectiveness of the interventions. Models of coping theories can help to explain patients' reactions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Parasomnias are unpleasant or undesirable behavioral, experiential, or motor phenomena that occur predominantly or exclusively during the sleep period (1). They may be classified as dysfunctions associated with transitions into sleep, partial arousals during sleep, or following arousals from sleep (2,3). Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.",

The possibility of alcohol or illicit drug use is investigated thoroughly in any patient who presents with acute mental status or behavioral changes. Acute symptoms may be caused by worsening of a neurological or medical condition or by another underlying neuropsychiatric condition. Chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms that worsen are commonly associated with psychosocial stressors and a related adjustment disorder. Certain conditions of a psychiatric nature, including destructiveness, disorganization, depression, disorientation due to severe organic mental disturbances, and conditions requiring detoxification, require psychiatric hospitalization, whether or not the patient has an underlying CNS disturbance.",

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "La posesión demoníaca, descrita por innumerables culturas a lo largo de la historia, sigue siendo actualmente un tema a discutir dentro del debate entre ciencia y religión. Este ensayo reflexivo, se ha propuesto analizar el fenómeno y abordarlo desde diversas perspectivas psicológicas que nos brinden una posible explicación lógica y coherente del suceso con el fin de esclarecerlo frente a las supersticiones de la cultura a través del método hermenéutico. Los signos de los posesos pueden deberse a otros factores, tanto neurobiológicos como psicológicos, como, por ejemplo, la aversión a los objetos religiosos y el surgimiento de una segunda personalidad, puede deberse a un cuadro de trastorno conversivo (neurosis) o presentarse en la esquizofrenia (psicosis), y la amnesia después del episodio puede deberse a la sobrecarga funcional del cerebro. Existen otros signos más complejos de explicar, como lo son el hablar en lenguas diferentes o la levitación; el primero lo trataremos descriptivamente desde el síndrome del idioma extranjero, que puede presentarse producto de factores neurológicos o en la misma psicosis, y la levitación podemos verla desde la física, con la llamada levitación magnética, a través de una hipótesis en la cual esta condición podría cumplirse en los seres humanos debido a la sobreexcitación cerebral que generaría cierto campo magnético. Finalmente, dentro de los aportes del psicoanálisis encontramos la neurosis como forma en que se manifiesta este fenómeno y damos por concluido que la posesión demoníaca se debe a dos sucesos: neurosis o psicosis, recalcando la importancia del análisis del contexto para realizar criterios diferenciadores en nuestro diagnóstico psicológico.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

PTSD is associated with family and relational distress; social, educational, and occupational impairment; comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions; and high economic costs and medical utilization. Effective treatments include cognitive behavioral therapies (e.g., exposure-based therapies) and pharmacotherapy (e.g., paroxetine and sertraline).",

D’abord, les diagnostics syndromiques sont modifiés. La définition de l’épisode dépressif caractérisé est simplifiée avec la suppression du critère d’exclusion lié au deuil. Ce choix, qui a pour but de mieux prendre en charge les dépressions post-deuil, a fait l’objet de nombreuses discussions et controverses. La définition de l’épisode maniaque ou hypomaniaque est également modifiée avec l’adjonction du symptôme modification de l’activité et de l’énergie [1]. Et les épisodes mixtes sont supprimés des diagnostics syndromiques et ré-intégrés comme caractéristiques spécifiques des troubles dépressifs ou bipolaires. Ce choix est secondaire aux excès antérieurs de diagnostics d’épisodes mixtes. Pour les chapitres troubles dépressifs [1] et troubles bipolaires [1], de nouvelles caractéristiques spécifiques apparaissent : les caractéristiques mixtes [1] (définies pour les épisodes dépressifs majeurs par la présence de 3 symptômes maniaques), les symptômes anxieux [1], et les caractéristiques spécifiques de risque suicidaire. Par ailleurs, de nouvelles entités sont introduites dans le chapitre troubles dépressifs [1]. Il s’agit du trouble dysphorique pré-menstruel, qui figurait auparavant dans l’appendice, et d’un nouveau trouble de l’enfant, le disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [1]. Enfin, dans le chapitre entités nécessitant de nouvelles études [1], apparaissent Ies épisodes dépressifs avec hypomanie de courte durée, le deuil pathologique complexe et persistant et les comportements suicidaires pathologiques. Ces différentes modifications devraient permettre, via leur remboursement, une meilleure prise en charge, aux États-Unis, du deuil pathologique, du risque suicidaire et du syndrome pré-menstruel pathologique.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

The psychiatric symptoms associated with cannabis use are agitation, insomnia, depressive or raised mood, anxiety, hallucinations, and concentration problems. It is known that cannabis use increases the risk for psychoses and bipolar disorders and may deteriorate the clinical presentation of pre-existing psychoses and bipolar disorders. A characteristic symptom of autoscopic psychosis is visual hallucination of some part or the entirety of a person’s body, imitating his or her behaviors and being perceived as if seen in a mirror. This is not a specific symptom of any mental disorder and the cause is not definitively known.

      "abstract": "DRUGS, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE: TOWARD A THEORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY PAUL WILLNER* Levels ofExplanation ofPsychotropic Drug Effects A few micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) can produce a major psychological experience, usually described as an \"altered state of consciousness,\" which can sometimes be the most powerful experience a person has ever had. \"Explanations\" ofthese phenomena usually involve a discussion of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) [1, 2]. Clearly, however, a description of biochemical phenomena in no sense explains the LSD experience, since no account is offered of how the biochemical changes give rise to altered states of consciousness. A similar problem arises in relation to biochemical \"theories\" of mental disorder, such as the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia or the catecholamine hypothesis of depression. Paranoid delusions are not explained by demonstrating that DA systems are hyperactive; neither are ideas of suicide explained by a malfunction of noradrenergic (NA) systems . However successful these reductionist hypotheses may be in generating testable hypotheses, leading, for example, to the development of effective pharmacological agents, a hypothesis of brain function which omits any reference to the structure or operating principles ofthe brain is unlikely to be of more than heuristic value. An alternative approach attempts to bridge this conceptual gap by seeking explanations of psychotropic drug effects in four independent explanatory domains: biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and subjective (using die word \"cognitive\" in the information-processing sense in which it is now used in cognitive psychology, rather than as a synonym for \"conscious\"). In terms of a computer analogy, these four domains ?Psychology Department, City of London Polytechnic, Old Castle Street, London El 7NT, England.© 1984 by The University of Chicago. AU rights reserved. 003 1-5982/85/2801-0404$01 .00 Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 28, 1 · Autumn 1984 \\ 49 include two levels of \"hardware\" and two of \"software,\" corresponding very roughly to components, wiring, programming, and editing. Each explanatory domain has its own language and logic, and each must be understood in its own terms. A recent theory of the action of anti-anxiety drugs [3] will serve as an illustration. In this account, which is embedded within the context of a comprehensive neuropsychological theory of anxiety, anxiolytic drugs act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, or at other sites (level 1), to disrupt the flow of impulses in neural circuits in the hippocampus and subiculum (level 2). The information carried in these circuits is used to make a comparison between actual and expected events: a mismatch activates a \"behavioural inhibition system,\" which suppresses ongoing motor activity and increases arousal and attention to the environment (level 3); these effects are experienced as anxiety (level 4). Irrespective of its empirical merits [4], the hypothesis has a sound conceptual basis. The analysis spans all four levels ofexplanation, rather than the usual two: physiological (level 2) and cognitive (level 3) levels are interposed between biochemistry (level 1) and subjective experience (level 4). In addition to describing an empirical relationship between receptor interactions and an anti-anxiety effect, die account also specifies the neural pathways implicated, their role in normal cognitive functioning , and the relationship between changes in cognitive function and changes in experience. In describing the psychological effect of a drug or an endogenous biochemical change, it is important to consider not only the intervening levels of explanation but also the nature of the transitions between adjacent levels. The generation of changes in neural firing (level 2) from the biochemical effect of a drug (level 1) depends on the integration of that biochemical effect into a context of other ongoing biochemical processes , which include adaptive regulation resulting from the primary drug effect. The effect of tricyclic antidepressant drugs at noradrenergic synapses is a well-worked example: it is now established that, in addition to potentiating neurotransmission by blocking neurotransmitter reuptake, after chronic treatment, tricyclics also decrease neurotransmission by reducing the sensitivity of postsynaptic beta-receptors [5]. It is rather less frequendy recognized, however, that the important issue is the net outcome of these and other effects on the traffic of nerve impulses in postsynaptic structures [6, 7]. Similar considerations apply to die transition from physiology (level 2) to cognitive processes (level 3). A good...",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Discontinuation syndromes have been noted for various classes of psychotropic medication and have now been observed for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other new serotonergic antidepressants. REVIEW SUMMARY SSRIs and other new antidepressants are increasingly being used for neurologic disorders as well as for depression and anxiety, which frequently coexist with these illnesses. Recently, a discontinuation syndrome was identified after abrupt and even tapered withdrawal from these agents. The syndrome presents with somatic symptoms of disequilibrium, gastrointestinal symptoms, flu-like symptoms, disrupted sleep, and sensory disturbances as well as psychological symptoms of irritability, crying spells, and anxiety or agitation. These symptoms, which usually appear within 1 to 3 days after the last dose, are usually mild and transient but can be more severely distressing and debilitating and lead to disruption of social or occupational activities. When intervention is required, the primary strategy entails reinstituting the SSRI and, if appropriate, commencing a slow and gradual tapering schedule. We review the cases of three patients with SSRI discontinuation syndrome who presented to the clinic with neurologic complaints. CONCLUSION The primary prevention strategy for discontinuation syndrome is to avoid abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant medication, particularly for agents demonstrating a pharmacologic profile of a short half-life and no active metabolites. Awareness of SSRI discontinuation syndrome facilitates rapid identification and effective intervention as well as improved prevention through patient education. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:348-352, 2000)",

      "abstract": "One of the reasons for the development or worsening of cognitive impairment (CI) may be the use of a number of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, glucocorticosteroids, antitumor drugs and a number of others. The negative effect of drugs on cognitive functions is realized due to many pathophysiological mechanisms: disruption of hormonal regulation, decreased neuronal excitability, increased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, decreased cerebral circulation, atrophic changes in the brain; many mechanisms have not been fully established. Risk factors for the development of drug-induced CIs are: old age or childhood, brain damage, chronic diseases, genetic factors, the patient's initial CI, polypharmacy, dose and duration of drug use, acute infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, dehydration, acute urinary retention, etc. To diagnose and differentially diagnose drug-induced CI, it is necessary to establish a connection between the start of taking a suspected drug-inducer and a decrease in cognitive functions. The first step in the treatment of drug-induced CI is the abolition of an inducer drug or a reduction in its dose, in cases where it is impossible to discontinue the drug and there is no replacement, special slow-release dosage forms can be considered. The main measures to prevent drug-induced CI include the use of drugs with the lowest risk of their development, assessment of drug interactions, and the use of modern scales to assess the risk of developing this side-effect (anticholinergic burden scale, etc.).",

Acute DID (ADID) occurs soon after starting to take a drug or raising its dose, and switching from one antipsychotic medication to another, especially to its injectable dosage form. Tardive DID (TDID) develops a few months or years after starting drug intake or 3 months after stopping therapy. The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

Where no organic cause can be discovered the condition is called Ménière’s disease. The syndrome is found in patients with bone disease involving the otic capsule such as otosclerosis, osteitis deformans or late syphilis. It may also follow labyrinthine trauma or be associated with a wide variety of diseases interfering with the blood supply to the brainstem or inner ear. Endolymphatic hydrops has been demonstrated in all these conditions, and it is believed that it may occur also in Ménière’s disease. Other causes of the syndrome include inflammatory or demyelinating disorders or tumours involving the eighth nerve. Many drugs have been used to treat Ménière’s disease, but with little success. Drugs investigated in recent years include cinnarizine (an antihistamine which has been used for vertigo and motion sickness), betahistine (an orally active histamine analogue) and hydrochlorothiazide.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep associated seizures especially Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE) represents a spectrum of challenging clinical manifestations presenting as complex nocturnal movements/behaviors, making the diagnosis often difficult. Report of Case A 64 y/o male, with history of ongoing complex movements occurring during his sleep, with no history of strokes or neurological deficits. Had extensive neurologic workup (all negative) including routine electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged inpatient EEG (12 hours), and MRI of the brain. Home sleep study showing moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) AHI 24/hour successfully treated with CPAP therapy (residual AHI 1.7/hour) with improved nighttime symptoms initially. Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury. Polysomnography (PSG) with seizure montage showed Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) foci recorded in the frontal/frontopolar leads without accompanying body movements. Interictal spike and wave activity seen during stage N2. Initially treated with carbamazepine (had skin reaction) switched to levetiracetam with complete resolution of his symptoms. Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of reviewing the clinical history, behavior semiology, and diagnostic ancillary testing such as polysomnography with EEG monitoring in distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from other nocturnal complex behavior disorders and parasomnias.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The word “psychedelic” derives from the Greek language and can be loosely translated as “mind manifesting” which is to convey that these substances allow the mind to unleash its hidden potential. Psilocybin is considered to be a “classic psychedelic” and is most commonly found in the form of so-called “magic mushrooms”. Due to its unique properties psilocybin has been used during religious ceremonies and rituals for centuries and more recently also explored in a medical context. Nowadays many studies are being carried out to prove the efficacy of its use in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders. &#x0D; Aim of study: Review of the current knowledge on the subject of psilocybin applied in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression and addiction.&#x0D; Methods and materials: A review of chosen literature was carried out in the PubMed database and Google Scholar using the following phrases: psilocybin, psychedelics, psychedelic-assisted therapy, major depressive disorder, addiction.&#x0D; Results: Recent studies suggest that psilocybin may be an effective form of treatment for cancer-related psychiatric distress, treatment-resistant depression and addiction. There are some reports of psilocybin being useful when treating obsessive-compulsive disorder and cluster headaches.&#x0D; Conclusions: More large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are required to prove these promising findings. Psychological support is crucial during the treatment with psilocybin.",

      "abstract": "As discussed in Chapter 1, for many young people, exacerbation of manic or depressive symptoms occurs through a spiral of contributing factors, both biological and psychosocial. Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

Most commonly, it is used to denote a condition in which stimulation in one sensory modality also gives rise to an experience in a different modality. However, conditions involving different qualities within one modality (e.g., when the sight of letter shapes evokes color) are labeled synesthesia as well. Phenomena of this sort have also been reported in patients with eye disease, brain damage, and migraines (e.g., Armel &amp; Ramachandran, 1999; Jacobs, Karpik, Bozian &amp; Gothgen, 1981; Podoll &amp; Robinson, 2002). Similar experiences have been reported in healthy individuals using mescaline and LSD (e.g., Hartman &amp; Hollister, 1963) or drinking psychoactive brews such as Ayahuasca (Shanon, 2002). Divine intervention has also been invoked as a possible trigger of synesthesia.",

Its primary symptoms are \"severe, recurrent temper outbursts\" (manifested verbally and/or physically) superimposed on and associated with chronic irritability. DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "title": "Hipoglikemijski sindromi - dijagnostički i terapijski pristup i prikaz dva slučaja",
      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

Presentación del caso: paciente con cuadro clínico que inicia a los 65 años, con disminución en la interacción social. Un par de meses después, la esposa nota que el lenguaje del paciente se torna poco fluido, habla con palabras o frases cortas, no logra decir oraciones completas, además de presentar cambios en la entonación de las palabras y alteraciones del lenguaje escrito. El paciente manifiesta que su principal limitación en el momento es el no poder expresar lo que quiere decir, y por este motivo consulta. Discusión: en el caso de este paciente, se describe inicialmente un cambio en su personalidad que no compromete su funcionalidad, sin embargo, al poco tiempo se presenta compromiso del lenguaje como síntoma prominente y que genera mayor compromiso en su calidad de vida, con pruebas neuropsicológicas y hallazgos de neuroimagen que apoyan el diagnóstico de afasia primaria progresiva (APP) variante no fluente o agramatical, con síntomas comportamentales y motores asociados. Conclusión: las APP son un grupo de trastornos neurocognitivos cuya característica primordial es el compromiso en el lenguaje, cada variante de APP tiene unas características clínicas y criterios diagnósticos específicos que se deben conocer para lograr sospechar el diagnóstico y hacer un abordaje apropiado en el paciente.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

      "title": "Evaluating Hallucinogenic or Psychedelic Drug Intoxication in an Emergency Setting",
      "abstract": "Under certain conditions or in an overdose setting, several classes of drugs can induce illusions, hallucinations, or delusions. However, one of the hallmark features of hallucinogens or psychedelic agents is their ability to induce states of altered or distorted perception, thought, and mood. Many hallucinogens produce classic sympathomimetic effects; that is, hyperactivity, mydriasis (dilated pupils), hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. However, the effects vary considerably, depending upon the hallucinogen ingested. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is suffering from hallucinogen intoxication such as marijuana use can be helpful to the clinician. However, the common toxicologic drug screens used by most clinical laboratories do not detect many hallucinogenic agents (such as LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide]). Thus, diagnosis of hallucinogen ingestion and treatment is often based on history of use and physical examination.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

The disturbances of perception appear to be fundamental to the other aspects of the disease.

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

Symptoms of this nature, which can include frightening hallucinations or anxiety of phobic proportions, are subjectively distressing and can lead both to unsafe or violent situations as well as to the preventable use of inappropriate medication, physical restraint, and frequently to institutionalization. These psychopathologic manifestations of dementia often prove to be a burden on family, caregivers, and the health care system as well. This article presents an overview of the assessment and management of agitation as it relates to the severity of dementia symptoms and cognitive deterioration. Specifically, the use of anticonvulsant and other non-neuroleptic therapies is examined. ( J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol 1995; 8(suppl 1):S28-S39).",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background and aims</h3> Sleep disorders, like difficulties falling asleep or maintaining sleep, are very common in children. Inadequate sleep may impact children's development, mood and behaviour and in consequence the wellbeing of their parents and caregivers. In a prospective, randomised, multicenter, open, comparative clinical trial the effectiveness of homeopathic ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (Cypripedium pubescens D4, Magnesium carbonicum D10, Zincum valerianicum D12) in children with sleep disorders and restlessness was evaluated. <h3>Methods</h3> Children aged≤6 years, suffering from sleep disorders for≥1 month, were randomised to receive either ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (intervention) or the aminoacetic acid glycine (control) for 28 days. Effectiveness endpoints included the change of 7 sleep related complaints (SRC; time to sleep onset, difficulties maintaining sleep, sleep duration, troubled sleep (somniloquism), physical inactivity after awakening, restlessness for unknown reason, sleep disorders frequency; total score = maximum 11 points) and parent's treatment satisfaction. Safety parameters were the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the tolerability of the treatments. <h3>Results</h3> The SRC total score decreased from baseline median 7.0 points in both groups to 2.0 points in the intervention group (n=89 children) and 4.0 points in the control group (n=90 children) after 28 days of treatment. Children of the intervention group had overall significant higher odds of getting lower SRC total score (odds ratio: 4.45 (95%-CI: 2.77–7.14), p&lt;0.0001; ITT). First clinical differences between both groups were seen already after 14 days. At day 28 significantly more children in the intervention group showed absence of individual complaints (Chi<sup>2</sup>-test: all P values≤0.0475; ITT). More parents were either 'very satisfied' (n=33) or 'satisfied' (n=49) with ZinCyp-3–02 treatment compared to the number of parents with 'very satisfied' (n=10) and 'satisfied' (n=28) ratings in the control group. Only few ADRs occurred (ZinCyp-3–02: n=2 (nervousness, excitability); control: n=1 (excitement)) and almost all parents and physician (&gt;93% out of 179) rated the tolerability of both treatments as 'very good' or 'good'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> ZinCyp-3–02 showed to be a safe and effective treatment option for paediatric sleep disorders and restlessness.",

Better understanding of the potentially lethal life situations and identification of individuals at risk may lead to the development of practical prophylactic measures.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

Several efforts have been guided by the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and have included exposure of animals to stressful stimulation. Other animal models have involved prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation or drugs that disrupt neuronal development, followed by stress during adolescence or in early adulthood to unmask vulnerabilities. Neonatal hippocampal lesions have been employed in other animal models of schizophrenia. Another profitable approach has been to selectively breed laboratory mice or rats for their susceptibility to dopaminergic drugs. A more recent approach has been to develop laboratory mice with targeted alterations in risk genes for schizophrenia that were previously identified in clinical studies. In many cases, the effects of these risk genes are unmasked by exposure of animals to stressful stimulation during specific stages of postnatal development.",

Ethanol is also frequently encountered. These drugs can be used for recreational purposes by addicts or can be observed after sexual assaults (drugs spiked in food). Forensic toxicology can be involved in several situations to document impairment, such as: crime under influence, date rape, driving under influence, psychiatric disorders, determination of the cause of death... In some particular situations, it can be very cautious to investigate exposure to psycho-active drugs, due to late sampling of biological specimens. To enhance the window of detection of 3 specific drugs, the authors propose the following: 1. Use of an ultra-sensitive technique, such as GC/MS/MS/NCI for 7-aminoflunitrazepam; 2. Use of a cumulative specimen, such as sweat for GHB and 3. Use of a metabolite with a long half-life, such as ethyl glucuronide for ethanol.",

      "title": "TWO CASES OF DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS DEVELOPING AFTER SEVERE MENTAL EMOTION AND SHOCK",
      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

      "title": "Anticonvulsants: aspects of their mechanisms of action",
      "abstract": "An ideal anticonvulsant drag would prevent or inhibit excessive pathological neuronal discharge without interfering with physiological neuronal activity and without producing untoward effects. Such an ideal compound is not yet available. However, during the last few years several new anticonvulsants have appeared (e.g. vigabatrine, gabapentin, topiramate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, felbamate and oxcarbazepine) which may challenge the older, more established substances (i.e. phenytoin, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, valproate, carbamazepine and ethosuximide). Interestingly, several of the old and new anticonvulsants are beneficial in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions (most notably mood disorders) as well as neuropathic pain. The reason these various drags are effective in the treatment of such disparate clinical conditions is unknown. The answer may be that the neuronal dysfunctions underlying these conditions are similar in a mechanistic sense, but are manifested in different neurons/locations of the nervous system, or that the drags possess several mechanisms of action that contribute in different ways to the favourable effect depending on the condition studied. Even though all these drags inhibit excessive neuronal activity, this acute effect appears to be produced by several mechanisms, which fall into three major categories: (1) blockade of voltage‐gated sodium channels; (2) indirect or direct enhancement of inhibitory γ‐aminobutyric acid [GABAergic] neurotransmission; or (3) inhibition of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. Moreover, several of these drags fall into more than one category, and it is often unclear which category is responsible for a given effect of a drag. It is plausible that some of the beneficial effects observed in the clinic can be explained by the secondary neural depressant mechanisms of action of these substances, whereas other benefits may be due to long‐term neuro‐plastic effects, which may either be common or different across the various conditions treated. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain",

      "abstract": "There are various types of hallucinogenic drugs that are distinguished by the psychological effects which they induce. The most familiar are the \"visionary psychodysleptics\" which produce prominent visual and somatic distortions and hallucinations. Complex emotional changes ranging from ecstasy to terror may occur, as well as alterations in thinking. Examples of such drugs are LSD, mescaline, and tryptamine derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The imagery-producing psychodysleptics such as cannabis and various coumarins (e.g., from Calea zacatechichi) potentiate visual imagery and produce characteristic distortions in time perception, body-image, and thought. Trance-producing psychodysleptics (such as lysergic acid amide (obtained from Rivea corymbosa) ololiquhqui, turbicoryn, and corymbosine), as their names suggest, produce trance-like states. Finally the deliriants (e.g., atropine) produce clouding of consciousness and amnesia, as well as hallucinatory effects.",

RLS is a clinical diagnosis, and common mimics of RLS include neuropathy, akathisia, and leg cramps. There is a bidirectional association between RLS and psychiatric disorders. RLS contributes to psychiatric comorbidity, especially anxiety, depression, and risk of self-harm or suicide, and RLS treatments can have iatrogenic behavioral effects, especially chronic dopaminergic drug. Conversely, serotonergic (e.g., SSRI, SNRI) and antihistamine (e.g., mirtazapine) drugs used to treat depression, chronic anxiety, and insomnia, have the potential to unmask or worsen RLS.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

Psychiatric disturbances usually take the form of euphoria or elation in mood. Depression is less likely, and irritability or aggressiveness may occur. In about 5 per cent of cases the alteration in mood may be accompanied by clouding of consciousness, delusions, hallucinations and disorientation. This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959). Disturbances may appear within six to seven hours of initial therapy (Goolker and Schein, 1953), after prolonged administration, or even after complete withdrawal of the hormone therapy.",

Dicho aumento ha ido acompanado de un uso no medico en adultos, bien por motivos recreacionales o con la finalidad de aumentar el rendimiento, academico o profesional. ?Tienen estas situaciones alguna relacion? En la infancia se utilizan los psicoestimulantes para tratar una enfermedad, con lo que en sentido estricto se utilizan exclusivamente como terapia. Pero al haberse relajado la interpretacion de los criterios diagnosticos del TDAH se plantea una situacion diferente, de medicalizacion (proceso por el cual queda bajo el control medico una situacion previamente vivida como fuera de ese ambito), mas que de mejoramiento (uso de un farmaco o tecnologia para mejorar una actividad de un sujeto sano). El aumento del uso de psicoestimulantes en la infancia seria un caso de medicalizacion. Este uso cada vez mas frecuente en la infancia tendria un efecto normalizador, de uso cotidiano. En la adolescencia y edad adulta, con dificultad para mantener o establecer el diagnostico de TDAH, se podria usar con criterios diferentes, de automedicacion con la finalidad de mejoramiento. Se analiza si el concepto de �enfermedad� que utilicemos puede llevar a un mayor o menor uso de psicofarmacos en la infancia, y si podria influir tambien en la edad adulta.",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is defined as difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, early awakening and poor subjective sleep quality despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep with impairment of daytime performance. These components of insomnia – namely persistent sleep difficulties despite of adequate sleep opportunity resulting in daytime dysfunction - appear secondary or co-morbid to neurological diseases. Comorbid insomnia originates from neurodegenerative, inflammatory, traumatic or ischemic changes in sleep regulating brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei with consecutive changes of neurotransmitters. Symptoms of neurological disorders (i.e motor deficits), co-morbidities (i.e. pain, depression, anxiety) and some disease-specific pharmaceuticals may cause insomnia and/or other sleep problems. This guideline focuses on insomnias in headaches, neurodegenerative movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, epilepsies, stroke, neuromuscular disease and dementia. The most important new recommendations are: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTi) is recommended to treat acute and chronic insomnia in headache patients. Insomnia is one of the most frequent sleep complaints in neurodegenerative movement disorders. Patients may benefit from CBTi, antidepressants (trazodone, doxepin), melatonin and gaba-agonists. Insomnia is a frequent precursor of MS symptoms by up to 10 years. CBTi is recommended in patients with MS, traumatic brain injury and. Melatonin may improve insomnia symptoms in children with epilepsies. Patients with insomnia after stroke can be treated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists and sedating antidepressants. For patients with dementia suffering from insomnia trazodone, light therapy and physical exercise are recommended.",

      "title": "Psychedelics: The New Kid on the Block",
      "abstract": "HISTORY In the early part of twentieth century, these molecules were known as psychotomimetics, meaning that they create a state similar to psychosis. Later on, they were also termed as hallucinogens, but psychedelics usually do not cause hallucinations at a therapeutic dose. The name psychedelics for these substances was first given by Osmond in 1957, meaning that they reveal useful or beneficial properties of the mind.[1] However, the idea that psychedelics can have beneficial effects has had mixed response till recently among the medical fraternity. Psychedelics strictly mean substances that alter perception, mood, and consciousness by acting on brain 5-HT2A receptors mainly as an agonist in the layer 5 of pyramidal cells in the cortex. This definition excludes other agents such as cannabinoids, dissociative agents such as ketamine, and entactogens such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, although all of them may cause hallucination, but their mechanism of action is different. The classic serotonin psychedelics such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) cause brain processes that are significantly different compared with normal consciousness[2] mainly by reducing between-network synchrony and increasing the connectivity between brain networks. These changes in integrative functions of the brain may be demonstrated using investigations such as electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography synchrony (decreased) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity (increased).[2] The effect on brain connectivity is long lasting and may persist for months after single use. Contrary to popular belief, psychedelics do not produce physical dependence or withdrawal on repeated use. PSYCHEDELICS AS TREATMENT Use of plant-based psychedelics like psilocybin or eyote in religious/ritualistic practices has an ancient history particularly in the American continent.[3] Psilocybin mushrooms were used by the Aztec shaman in healing and in a variety of religious rituals. Peyote (Lophophora williamsii) is a small cactus found mainly in the South America and Northern Mexico that has been used since ancient times and is consumed as a sacrament during services of the Native American Church. Psychedelics are an exceptional category of mind-altering substances and has been in use in various cultures as Sacrament.[4,5] In this regard, Jaffe[6] has given a highly revered definition of psychedelics \"…The feature that distinguishes the psychedelic agents from other classes of drug is their capacity reliably to induce states of altered perception, thought, and feeling that are not experienced otherwise except in dreams or at times of religious exaltation.\" Psychedelics played a substantial role in defining the youth culture of the 1960s and 1970s. The powerful psychological effect of LSD was accidently discovered in 1943 by Hofmann,[7] after 10 years of LSD discovery the detection of serotonin in the mammalian brain was done by Twarog and Page in 1953.[8] The discovery of LSD has greatly influenced the research in the field of Serotonin Neuroscience. One of the eminent LSD researchers[8] noted that \"…One basic dimension of behavior… compellingly revealed in LSD states is \"Portentousness\" which is the capacity of the mind to see more than it can tell…. to believe in more than it can rationally justify, to experience boundlessness and \"Boundaryless\" events, from the banal to the profound.\" The word entheogen has been coined as a substitute for psychedelic to reduce the negative overtone. The word entheogen usually means a substance or material that generates God or the divine within someone. However, the effects produced by psychedelics are highly dependent on the set (mental expectation) of the user and the setting (environment).[9] RESEARCH WITH PSYCHEDELICS The initial research into psychedelics was done by the American and European physicians with peyote (Mescaline). Mescaline was identified in 1894 by the German chemist Arthur Heffter, then synthesized in 1919 by the Austrian chemist Ernst Späth. This opened the gate for Medical Research in psychedelics in North America and Europe. As early as in 1934, French psychiatrists Henri Claude suggested the possibility of using mescaline for the treatment of depression.[10] The discovery of the effects of the LSD in 1943 and the rediscovery of Mexican divinatory mushrooms in 1953 led to extensive medical research on psychedelics.[11] However, by 1960s, the research in psychedelics drastically declined due to various factors like anti-war demonstration by so-called hippies who used to abuse LSD, rejection of conventional social norms by adolescents and college students, public hysteria concerning drug-induced insanity, and experiments conducted at a renowned US university without institutional approval.[12] Interestingly, since the late 1980s, there was a gradual increasing interest in psychedelics with numerous publications in the field of neurobiology and neuroscience of psychedelics, which has been termed as \"Psychedelic renaissance.\"[13] Initial clinical trials focused on the benefits of psilocybin to reduce anxiety and improve the mood of patients with cancer.[14] In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial, they investigated the effects of a very low dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) versus a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up in 51 cancer patients with symptoms of depression and anxiety. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in measures of depressed mood and anxiety, improved quality of life, increased optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were maintained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety.[14] Many researchers have tested psychedelics in conjunction with psychotherapy for the treatment of anxiety and depression. A study compared psilocybin with escitalopram over a 6-week period in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder in a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 59 patients were enrolled: 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. All the subjects received psychotherapy. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self-Report. At the end of 6 weeks, there was no significant difference in the antidepressant effects between escitalopram and psilocybin.[15] In a recent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression, a single dose of ayahuasca was compared against placebo.[16] Improvement in depression was assessed with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale at baseline, at 1, 2, and 7 days after dosing. Significant antidepressant effects of ayahuasca were seen when compared with placebo at all-time points. Ayahuasca is a brew that contains the psychedelic DMT and Harmine (RMAOi). This was a unique study which assessed the efficacy of a single-dose psychedelic in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Researchers have also investigated the effects of psilocybin in addiction disorders. Researchers conducted a proof-of-concept study to assess the effects of psilocybin in alcohol-dependent participants. Ten volunteers received orally administered psilocybin in one or two supervised sessions along with Motivational Enhancement Therapy. Abstinence increased significantly following psilocybin administration (P < 0.05) and was maintained at follow-up to 36 weeks. The magnitude of effects in the first psilocybin session also predicted decreases in craving. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events.[17] Since DMT can induce a rapid (3–5 min) intense altered state of consciousness with a sense of being transported to an alternative world, without any disturbances in wakefulness which subsides within 15–20 min, it is a very useful molecule to study consciousness. In a recent landmark study, they assessed the effects of single bolus dose of 20 mg intravenous DMT on human brain by doing simultaneous fMRI and EEG before (8 min prior), during, and after the DMT dose (20 min) on 20 healthy volunteers in a within group placebo controlled, pseudo-randomized setting. The fMRI results correlated with significant increases in global functional connectivity, network disintegration, and desegregation. DMT was associated with decrease modularity, especially for frontoparietal, salience, and default-mode networks. Analyses of EEG activity revealed widespread decreases in alpha under DMT and increases in both delta and gamma bands. The major finding of the study was dysregulation of activity in the brain's transmodal association cortex pole (TOP), so that TOP becomes less segregated from or more integrated with the rest of the cortex. This implies that brain functions mainly in entropic mode under psychedelics which may be the reason for their distinct phenomenology. This multimodal, multivariate EEG-fMRI study with DMT revealed a robust dysregulating effect on activity in the brain's TOP with increased communication between the TOP of the cortex and the rest of the brain. This may be interpreted as evidence of increased information processing and a hyper-associative style of cognition.[18] Researchers performed a scientometric analysis to assess the research trend on psychedelics over a period of 100 years. A scientometric approach objectively maps the scientific knowledge area and shows how research trends have evolved over time which is superior to bibliometric analysis. Total 31,867 documents cumulating 591,329 references from 2809 different sources in 22 different languages were found, with 95.5% being in English. The analysis revealed reveals two essential time periods. The first time period was from early 1900 to 1990 with maximum 171 articles in 1974. The second time period from 1990 to date presents consistently increasing trend of publications, from 190 publications in 1990 to 1538 in 2021. The topmost cited study was the randomised controlled trial of psilocybin use for life-threatening cancer patients with depression by Solmi et al. with depression was published in 2016. The research network analysis found 16,162 institutions, the top three institutions with highest number of publications were University of California (n = 929), the National Institutes of Health USA (n = 770), and the University of London (n = 740). The important trend saw an evolution from LSD effects to the therapeutic potential psilocybin and DMT.[19] Evidence has been accumulating on the efficacy of psychedelics in depression, several phase 2 trials have shown very promising results; both ayahuasca[20] and psilocybin[21] were superior to placebo, and psilocybin was comparable to escitalopram. Other than depression and anxiety new randomized controlled trials are ongoing to evaluate psychedelics in anorexia nervosa.[22] Interestingly, psychedelics seem to reduce the gap between pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, using the effects of the pharmacological intervention as a key to enhance psychotherapy.[23] CONCLUSIONS The use of psychedelics in otherwise treatment refractory conditions is perhaps the most promising development in Psychiatry. Multiple phase II and III clinical trials have proven the efficacy of psychedelics particularly Psilocybin in various mental and physical conditions like depression, addictions, anxiety, anorexia nervosa, and pain. Psychedelics are also a good adjunct to psychotherapy. If used responsibly and with proper caution the psychedelics may revolutionize the field of psychopharmacology. With the approval of esketamine in depression, it may not be too far when psilocybin will also be used in patients with various mental health conditions. The ethical and legal ramifications of the same will also have to be looked into and stringent guidelines will have to laid out.",

Non-convulsive seizures represent states of various levels of altered awareness, associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity, but without outwardly observable convulsive activity2.

Other types of status epilepticus include simple partial status (with preserved awareness), complex partial status (with impaired consciousness) and myoclonic status (often associated with coma)4.\r\n\r\nRecords from antiquity describe SE, but it has only been in the last century that there have been major advances in its understanding and treatment5.

      "abstract": "Benzodiazepines have anxiolytic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle-relaxing properties, therefore, a widely prescribed treatment for anxiety and insomnia. They bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, which are responsible for most of the inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and these receptors are a major target of alcohol, barbiturates, muscle relaxants, and other medications with sedative effects, resulting in tolerance and dependence [1]. Benzodiazepines are categorized into short (15 to 30 minutes), intermediate (30 to 60 minutes), and long-acting agents (one hour or longer).\r\nBenzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for elderly patients living in the community and for those in hospitals and institutions. Prolonged use of benzodiazepines is particularly likely in old age for the treatment not only of insomnia and anxiety, but also of a wide range of nonspecific symptoms. Long term users are likely to have multiple concomitant physical and psychological health problems [2].\r\nBenzodiazepines produce dependence, reduce attention, memory, and motor ability. They can cause disinhibition or aggressive behavior, facilitate the appearance of delirium, and increase accident and mortality rates in people older than 60 [3].\r\nAccording to Maudsley guidelines, benzodiazepines use in elderly are poorly supported for their link to cognitive decline, increase risk of falls and hip fractures [4]. And, if indicated, short acting agents should be avoided. Long acting agents should be started in low doses and patients need to be followed and reassessed regularly. Zolpidem or melatonin are indicated for insomnia, clonazepam and diazepam for agitation and pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder [5].",

      "abstract": "O Status Epilepticus (SE) e u ama ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e ou sintomas devido a atividade neuronal excessiva ou sincronia anormal no cerebro. O termo transitorio e usado como demarcador de tempo, para inicio e fim da crise. A crise neonatal constitui-se a mais frequente manifestacao de disfuncao neurologica no recem-nascido, com maior incidencia no primeiro ano de vida, e apresenta risco de morte, lesao neuronal, morte neuronal, alteracoes de redes neuronais ou prejuizos neurologicos e cognitivos de longo prazo dependendo do tipo de duracao da crise. Entretanto, cerca de 40%-50% das criancas afetadas se desenvolvem normalmente. Estudos em modelos animais demonstram que as convulsoes neonatais em roedores produzem efeitos adversos neurologicos de longo prazo, tais como: deficits na aprendizagem, memoria visuo-espacial, prejuizo na flexibilidade cognitiva, comportamento autista, caracterizado pela baixa preferencia pela novidade social, deficit de discriminacao social e comportamento tipo ansioso. Com base no conjunto de alteracoes desencadeadas pelas crises neonatais em roedores, o modelo pode ser util para a investigacao da relacao entre as convulsoes no inicio do desenvolvimento e as funcoes executivas. Assim, este projeto pretende avaliar comportamentos relacionados as funcoes executivas de animais que foram expostos ao SE neonatal. Ratos Wistar machos ao nono dia de vida (P9) foram submetidos ao SE pela administracao da policarpina (350 mg/kg, ip) e os controles receberam salina 0,9% (0,1 mL/10 g). Em P60 os animais foram avaliados pelos seguintes paradigmas: a caixa de condicionamento operante e o labirinto em T. A amostra foi composta por 25 animais, 11 controles e 14 experimentais. Estes testes avaliam: aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, consolidacao da memoria, memoria de trabalho, comportamento perseverante, controle inibitorio e flexibilidade comportamental. Os dados sugerem que o grupo experimental, na caixa de condicionamento operante, nao exibiu prejuizo na aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, que houve a consolidacao da memoria, nao apresentou comportamento perseverante, prejuizo na memoria de trabalho e nem comportamento perseverante. No labirinto em T o grupo experimental mantiveram preservadas a memoria de trabalho, a memoria de referencia e motivacao, e nao exibiram prejuizo na flexibilidade comportamental. Os dados sugerem que um unico episodio SE neonatal nao impacta a aprendizagem associativa, a memoria de longo prazo, as memorias de trabalho e de referencia e a flexibilidade comportamental.",

Sleep-disordered breathing resulting from these disorders may take the form of periodic central or obstructive apneas or hypopneas or sustained hypoventilation; all forms generally worsen during rapid eye movement sleep. Clinical manifestations commonly include nocturnal sleep disturbances such as insomnia and snoring and daytime symptoms such as hypersomnolence and cognitive impairment. Treatment depends on the specific pattern of respiratory impairment during sleep and may include ventilatory support modalities, nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or various pharmacologic maneuvers.",

Support for, and criticism against, the existence of this syndrome as a specific personality disorder has produced more fire than substance, but the presence of an unsettled, ongoing controversy has been acknowledged. At present, the strongest support stems from the many clinicians who have described and attempted to manage seizure patients with these personality features. Carefully directed studies are needed to confirm or deny that the Geschwind syndrome represents a specific epilepsy/psychiatric disorder.",

Prevalence of this condition is unavailable in developing countries of the world. It is classified as \"L98.1 Excoriation (skin-picking) Disorder\" in ICD-10 and referred in some literature as \"dermatillomania\". ED is characterized by, but not invariably, the compulsive urge to pick, squeeze or scratch skin surfaces experienced by patients. Commonly picked parts of the body include the face (most picked), arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, the knuckles (via mouth leading to temporary disfiguration of distal and proximal joints of the middle and little fingers) and other extremities e.g. the fingernails, cuticles, and toe nails;5 skin picking may be accompanied by anxiety with depression following picking. It is often triggered by factors that include feeling or examining irregularities on the skin, feeling anxious etc. Complications include infections, tissue damage and sepsis. Rarely, severe cases cause lifethreatening injuries. Risk of self-harm is increased by feelings of intense helplessness, guilt, shame and embarrassment.8 Studies further describe significant associations between ED and suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of neuroleptic (or anti-psychotic) medication into clinical practice was a major advance in the treatment of schizophrenia. Numerous well-controlled, double-blind clinical trials have established the therapeutic efficacy of these agents in both the acute and long-term treatment of schizophrenia (Klein et al , 1980; Kane &amp; Lieberman, 1987). In general, the therapeutic benefit of medication has been assessed in terms of the relative reduction in the more florid signs and symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, agitation, and hostility) and the ability of maintenance medication to reduce the rate of recurrence of these symptoms and in turn rates of rehospitalisation. At the same time it has been quite apparent that anti-psychotic drugs do not necessarily eliminate some of the major chronic disabilities of patients with this illness, disabilities reflected in impoverished affect, lack of drive and ambition, impaired spontaneity, reduced ability to relate to others, and diminished pleasure capacity. These symptoms have at times been described as negative in that they reflect an absence of or reduction in certain aspects of psychologic, cognitive, and emotional functioning in an attempt to distinguish them from the distortions or exaggerations in normal function which characterise positive symptoms (Strauss &amp; Carpenter, 1974; Jackson, 1904).",

Particular significance has been attributed to the role of such disturbances of thinking in schizophrenia.<sup>6</sup>When questions of differential diagnosis arise, it has become common clinical practice to utilize the criterion of disturbed abstracting abilities as a pathognomonic indicator of a schizophrenic disorder. Brief tests of abstracting abilities, such as the interpretation of proverbs, are commonly included in procedures designed to assess a patient's mental status in the course of the diagnostic study of a patient.<sup>12</sup>Much of the empirical justification for this practice derives from studies which tend to demonstrate that the conceptual skills of schizophrenics are different from or inferior to the conceptual abilities of normal nonschizophrenic individuals.<sup>5</sup>",

Disbelief is an emotional reaction that may happen immediately on hearing the diagnosis, or later as a form of denial. There are feelings of despair, grief, and sadness. A feeling of upset and tears may occur at the time of being given a diagnosis, soon after, or soon after the initial shock has worn off. It may initially have been triggered by fear and the serious countenance of the patient's relatives or loved ones or the doctor concerned.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

Not all patients have all symptoms. When cataplexy is present, the disorder is almost always due to a destruction by the immune system of about 70,000 brain cells that produce a chemical called hypocretin. As this chemical helps in staying awake and regulating sleep and muscle tone, the lack of hypocretin explains all the symptoms of narcolepsy. In these cases of narcolepsy, the disease is life-long and does not resolve. When cataplexy is not present, many causes may be involved and the diagnosis is more difficult. Evolution and response to treatment are also more variable. Narcolepsy is diagnosed using sleep tests, biochemical measures and occasionally by measuring hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after a lumbar puncture. Current treatments involve medication and behavioral, life styles changes.",

      "abstract": "### Key learning points\n\nIntellectual disability (ID; also known as learning disability) is characterised by significant impairment of both cognitive functioning and adaptive behaviours, and an onset in early childhood. People with ID experience a different pattern of morbidity to the general population and die considerably younger than their counterparts without ID.1 Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by troubles with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. In both conditions, complex mental and physical health problems, as well as social issues, are common and are associated with communication difficulties that can result in maladaptive behavioural patterns (often referred to as ‘behaviour that challenges’). Ideally, all people presenting with behaviour that challenges should be assessed by a specialist multidisciplinary team (comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists) to develop an understanding of the behaviour and an appropriate support plan with tailored treatment strategies and specialist follow-up.2 Non-pharmacological interventions for challenging behaviour, such as positive behavioural support or cognitive–behavioural therapy and manipulation of environmental triggers, are preferred to psychotropic medication. However, antipsychotic medication is often prescribed to adults with ID and/or autism to manage behaviour that challenges in the absence of severe mental illness, despite there being little research evidence that antipsychotics are effective in this context.3 \n\nThere …",

Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of psychiatric disorder is well established for the non‐learning‐disabled population. In clinical practice, medication seems to be broadly as effective for people with learning disabilities. The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of challenging behaviours is less well established, although evidence for effectiveness is accumulating for some types of problem behaviour. When treating behavioural problems, medication is often used in combination with other management strategies. Knowledge of side effects is important, because people who have difficulty communicating may not be able to Report problems before they become severe. When using medication, it is important to try to achieve the best benefit: risk ratio, taking into account the person's other health problems and disabilities. It may be necessary to measure treatment effects, using standardised assessments or individual measures of target symptoms or behaviours.",

      "title": "Bipolar Depression: <i>Best Practices for the Hospitalized Patient</i>",
      "abstract": "One of the most challenging clinical topics in psychiatry is the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar depression. The term mood stabilizer is frequently employed in the treatment of the hospitalized bipolar patient, although clinicians do not universally agree on a consensus definition of this term. Most clinicians would agree that a mood stabilizer refers to a medication that is effective for the acute treatment of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive episodes. Many experts agree that such treatment should offer efficacy against mania, should not worsen depression, and preferably should treat depression as well. In addition, the acute effectiveness in stabilization should not be at the expense of inducing alternate mood symptoms or switching the patient into the alternate phase of illness. From a maintenance standpoint, a mood stabilizer should also prevent against future relapse or recurrence of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive symptoms or episodes (Slide 1). In addition to use of mood stabilizers, there are other issues surrounding treatment of the hospitalized patient with bipolar depression, including the commonly comorbid issue of substance abuse. Hazardous drinking may more commonly occur in bipolar depression or depressive phase of illness, representing a more complex clinical picture. To facilitate understanding of this complex disorder and its appropriate treatment, this discussion centers around the case of a major depressive episode in a patient with a past history of of mania (ie, bipolar I depression or bipolar depression).",

Hierzu gehören Anhedonie, Reduktion motorischer und sexueller Aktivität, verminderte Nahrungsaufnahme, gestörter Schlaf und kognitive Defizite. Inflammatorische Zytokine spielen in der Vermittlung dieser Verhaltensänderungen eine zentrale Rolle. Auch bei therapeutischer Anwendung von Zytokinen, zum Beispiel von Interferonen, kommt es zu ähnlichen Symptomen; es werden sogar behandlungsbedürftige depressive Erkrankungen und Suizidhandlungen beobachtet. In Studien an gesunden Probanden konnten mittels experimenteller Stimulation des Immunsystems Veränderungen des Affektes, kognitive Defizite und Störungen des Schlaf-Wach-Verhaltens induziert werden, die denen bei depressiven Erkrankungen ähneln. Experimentelle Immunstimulation scheint somit ein geeignetes Modell zur Erforschung der Neurobiologie der Depression zu sein, wobei es insbesondere zum Verständnis solcher depressiver Störungen beitragen kann, die bei Erkrankungen mit vermehrter Zytokinfreisetzung auftreten.

      "title": "1699 – Long lasting personality changes after the onset of dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Across various cultures, dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage (as detected by conventional structural brain imaging). In a substantial number of cases, the memory impairment follows a chronic course. Sometimes dissociative amnesia occurs on a background of a personality disorder (narcissistic or borderline). Other times, amnesia itself triggers long lasting personality changes. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition among health care providers of the spectrum of the personality changes that may accompany chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically, neuropsychologically and and neuroradiologically. Changes in personality dimensions occur after the onset of amnesia. These may involve affectivity, perception (e.g. impaired self face or face-emotion processing), cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behaviour (e.g. changing in eating, smoking, drinking or working habits). The observed personality changes may represent a consequence of amnesia. Functional imaging studies show metabolic changes in dissociative amnesia in brain areas involved in conscious mnemonic processing. Several structures engaged in processing within episodic-autobiographical memory system were also implicated in self and reward-related processing. Alternatively, the personality changes may be viewed as being pivotal in the development and maintenance of dissociative amnesia; this personality shift may subsequently lead to enduring changes in ways of cognitive processing, self-processing, perception and affect.",

A useful clinical indicator that the event was the trigger is that the intensity of the symptoms increases when it is being recalled or recounted and diminishes when the person is removed from it. A number of differentials should also be considered. ICD-11 proposes specific criteria for ICD-11 that include preoccupation with the stressor and difficulty adapting, as evidenced by impaired concentration, sleep disturbance, and so on, causing impairment in functioning. It is unclear whether those diagnosed with AD using the new criteria will be the same clinically as those currently so diagnosed.",

Some symptoms of the disease, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, can be ameliorated with drug treatment, whereas other symptoms, such as social withdrawal and cognitive decline, remain uncontrolled. It is possible that these latter symptoms that are often termed ''negative symptoms'' are the result of anatomical and neurochemical abnormalities, whereas those symptoms of the disease such as auditory hallucinations that are termed ''positive symptoms'' may be a result of only neurochemical disorders. The drugs used to treat schizophrenia are designated neuroleptics. The term neuroleptic was chosen to emphasize the similarity of pharmacological profiles of drugs with entirely different chemical structures. Especially prominent features of the effects of neuroleptics include the following: a state of affective indifference; a decrease in locomotor activity; a decrease in excitation, agitation, and aggressiveness; and an antipsychotic action in patients with acute as well as chronic psychoses.",

      "title": "Post-Stroke Apathy: An Exploratory Longitudinal Study",
      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (&amp;#x03C7;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Two neuronal structures, i.e., the cerebral cortex and the subcortical structures, were shown by clinical observations to be involved in maintaining consciousness. The alteration of consciousness during epileptic seizures is discussed with respect to these findings: Alterations of consciousness during epileptic seizures may be produced by subcortical, i.e., reticular formation, and/or cortical dysfunction followed by excessive, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. An impairment of consciousness during absence seizures may be due mainly to cortical dysfunction; during complex partial seizures (CPS), it may be due to dysfunctional subcortical neuronal structures. The mechanisms underlying an alteration of consciousness are defined as causing “irritative” functional disturbances and/or as having “inhibitory” effects on consciousness‐related structures.",

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal. Percebe-se que o fonoaudiólogo pode contribuir para amenizar os sintomas encontrados nestas patologias, proporcionando uma qualidade de vida melhor aos seus portadores.",

SUDs are more prevalent in patients who have depression or anxiety disorders or other psychiatric comorbidities (including personality disorders) and in those who use tobacco or alcohol. Patients with a dual diagnosis (i.e., both SUD and another major psychiatric disorder) may present with complex clinical histories and symptoms that make diagnosis challenging.

Antidepressants and mood stabilizers, the medications commonly used to treat depression or bipolar illness, do not produce dependence and have no potential for abuse. They are safe for individuals in recovery from alcoholism or drug dependence. Depression is no longer attributed simply to too little neurochemicals such as serotonin or norepinephrine. Instead, depression is associated with a dysregulation of neurochemical firing patterns. Antidepressants treat specific symptoms of depression such as depressed mood, sadness, fatigue and suicidality, and they also regulate the altered brain chemistry that may contribute to these symptoms.",

Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is experiencing a sympathomimetic drug reaction can be helpful to the clinician. However, some of the conventional toxicologic drug screens used by many clinical laboratories do not differentiate within a specific class of drugs (eg, amphetamine vs methamphetamine). Although a drug screen can help to confirm ingestion of a sympathomimetic drug, diagnosis and treatment are often based on history of use (often unreliable), physical examination, and the classic toxidrome observed with this class of drugs.",

They lasted from a few seconds to 2 hours and were associated with poor reactivity and amnesia of the events. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed wake-state features, with brief bursts of hypnagogic hypersynchrony, and did not display seizure activity. A distinctive behavior disorder occurring during wake-sleep transitions with a wake EEG pattern has been identified in very early childhood.

However, sympathetic activation also underlies promptness to action, so it is not clear whether the same relation could stand for parental responses to infant cry given that a ready and prompt parental response to infant cry favors more adaptive cognitive, social, and emotional development in the infant. Previous studies have not been consistent in the interpretation of sympathetic activation which occurs in response to infant cry. We discuss these two opposing proposed interpretations. A possible alternative interpretation may be that medium activation of the SNS is adaptive because it prepares the organism to act promptly, whereas too low or too high SNS activation is maladaptive because it underlies a lack of empathetic reaction or a highly distressed response.",

      "abstract": "L’insomni es un trastorn caracteritzat per la insatisfaccio en la qualitat i/o quantitat del son, que persisteix durant un considerable periode de temps. Es un son no reparador, amb consequencies diurnes com la fatiga, la irritabilitat o la disminucio de l’alerta, que afecta tant la vida social com laboral de l’individu. Dels diferents trastorns primaris del son, l’etiologia dels quals no es deguda a una malaltia mental, medica o a cap substancia, l’insomni primari te una prevalenca mitjana a la poblacio del 30%. Historicament el tractament farmacologic de l’insomni ha tingut com a principal diana el receptor GABA(A). L’evolucio dels hipnotics que actuen sobre aquest receptor, ha aportat una millora en la seva eficacia i seguretat. Tot i aixi, encara tenen efectes no desitjats com l’insomni de rebot, la dependencia, l’amnesia anterograda o la tolerancia. El nostre objectiu es trobar un candidat que millori els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals. Seguint una estrategia de cribratge, seleccionar un compost amb: 1) major selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat ?1 del receptor GABA(A), implicada en el son, 2) activitat hipnotica in vivo que no alteri l’arquitectura del son i 3) una absorcio oral rapida i vida mitjana adequada. Dels 1214 compostos que es van cribrar en total, dos van presentar una elevada selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A) major que la del zolpidem, el farmac de referencia mes selectiu que hi ha actualment al mercat. Aquesta selectivitat in vitro dels compostos, es correlaciona amb la selectivitat in vivo, de manera que els compostos mes selectius per la subunitat alfa-1 in vitro, son tambe els que indueixen sedacio in vivo sense efectes no desitjats com la relaxacio muscular associada a la subunitat alfa-2 del receptor GABA(A) Pero l’efecte in vivo no depen nomes de l’afinitat del compost pel receptor, sino tambe del nombre de receptors que el compost ocupa al teixit diana i de la seva eficacia intrinseca per activar-los i generar una resposta biologica. L’ocupacio de receptors s’ha analitzat en estudis ex-vivo i s’ha relacionat amb l’efecte observat en els assaigs de comportament in vivo. Quan es determina l’ocupacio ex-vivo del receptor GABA(A) per part dels compostos en determinades arees del cervell, on predomina una determinada subunitat del receptor, els compostos amb mes afinitat per la subunitat alfa-1 que indueixen sedacio a dosi mes baixa, tambe son els que per norma general requereixen menys dosi per assolir el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo dels receptors a cerebel (on predomina la subunitat alfa-1 implicada en sedacio). En el mateix sentit, els compostos menys afins per alfa-2 que requereixen una dosi mes alta per induir relaxacio muscular, son tambe els que per norma general assoleixen el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo a medul•la (on predomina la subunitat alfa-2) a una dosi mes gran. Les dades d’ocupacio ex-vivo a cerebel corroboren l’afinitat dels compostos in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A). En base als resultats presentats en la present Tesi Doctoral, es conclou que s’ha generat i seleccionat un candidat que podria millorar els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals en els estudis preclinics.",

      "abstract": "Success at school increases self-esteem. Any difficulty will have consequential effects on the psychological health of the subject. The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "title": "Clozapine: Since the very beginning?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Psychosis in childhood and adolescence could be defined as having hallucinations, with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight. A broader definition includes symptoms such as delirious thoughts, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, cognitive and mood symptoms and what is called negative symptoms. Several researches have been done focused in the treatment of first episode of psychosis showing clozapine as a keystone in the treatment of psychosis, especially in refractory first episodes. Objectives Clozapine has unique efficacy in improving treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia but the moment of instauration remains unclear. There have always been doubts about the right moment to start clozapine, after two or more previous anti-psychotics or as first option. Materials and methods We report a 18-year- old woman with family history of severe psychosis. Her mum reasserted patient's symptoms contributing to a longer period of non-treating psychosis (about 10 months). Auditory hallucinations, incongruent mood and incoherent language appeared for the first time at the age of 17. High doses of two consecutive anti-psychotics were tried without remission and finally clozapine was initiated with clinical improvement. Discussion In clinical practice, a subgroup of psychotic patients experience, significant ongoing positive symptoms despite of using first line anti-psychotic medication. Conclusion Most recent research; suggest that clozapine may have an important role in the early treatment of first-episode patients, even becoming a first line option to consider.

      "abstract": "Abstract Neglect is the failure to report, respond, or orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion, when this failure cannot be attributed to either sensory or motor defects (Heilman, 1979). Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

      "title": "Primary or secondary? What came first and how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

According to the recent reports, 1 out of every 58 newly-born children is suffering from autism. The aetiology of the disorder is complex and poorly understood, hindering the adaptation of targeted and effective therapies. There are no well- established diagnostic biomarkers for autism. Hence the analysis of symptoms by the pediatricians plays a critical role in the early intervention.In the present report, we have emphasized 24 behavioral, psychological and clinical symptoms of autism.Impaired social interaction, restrictive and narrow interests, anxiety, depression; aggressive, repetitive, rigid and self-injurious behavior, lack of consistency, short attention span, fear, shyness and phobias, hypersensitivity and rapid mood alterations, high level of food and toy selectivity; inability to establish friendships or follow the instructions; fascination by round spinning objects and eating non-food materials are common psychological characteristics of autism. Speech or hearing impairments, poor cognitive function, gastrointestinal problems, weak immunity, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms, weak motor neuromuscular interaction, lower level of serotonin and neurotransmitters, headache and body pain are common physiological symptoms.A variable qualitative and quantitative impact of this wide range of symptoms is perceived in each autistic individual, making him/her distinct, incomparable and exceptional. Selection and application of highly personalized medical and psychological therapies are therefore recommended for the management and treatment of autism.",

      "title": "Melatonin for Sundown Syndrome and Delirium in Dementia: Is It Effective?",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The terms \"sundown syndrome\" or \"sundowning\" are used to describe a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in individuals with dementia in the late afternoon, evening, or night.1 These symptoms include confusion, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, aggression, pacing, wandering, screaming, yelling, and hallucinations. The treatment of sundown syndrome is challenging, and pharmacological therapies are not particularly effective. An 81-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed 4 years previously was admitted to the elderly department because of behavioral disturbances, sleep disorders, and wandering. His wife said that his cognitive and functional impairments had gradually worsened over the past 4 years and that, in the last 6 months, her husband had become verbally aggressive, agitated, and restless; wandered; and paced. He did not sleep for long and had difficulty falling asleep. The symptoms increased in the late afternoon and at night. He had no hallucinations or delusions. One month before admission, delirium was suspected, and his general practitioner prescribed haloperidol, but it was not effective. Physical and neurological examination showed no abnormalities. He scored 8 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (indicating severe cognitive impairment) and 50 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (indicating severe behavioral disturbances). Blood and urine test results were normal. During admission, sundown syndrome was diagnosed, and he received pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for behavioral and sleep disturbances, but none was effective, and some aggravated symptoms. The pharmacological interventions consisted of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, cholinesterase inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants, all given in an optimal dosing schedule. After extensive review of his history, the effect of past treatments, and the published literature, melatonin was started at a dose of 2 mg at 8:00 p.m. for sleep disorders. Not only did his sleep quality improve within a week, but there was also significant improvement in his behavior within 2 hours of initiation of melatonin. A therapeutic trial with an additional dose of 2 mg given at 3:00 p.m. was started, and his symptoms gradually improved over the subsequent 2 weeks (NPI score 20). No behavioral changes were observed in the 2-month follow-up. The prevalence of sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia is estimated to be 2.4% to 66%.1 This wide variation is primarily due to the numerous definitions of the disorder. Several studies have reported that the circadian rhythm, which melatonin regulates, may be an important factor contributing to sundown syndrome.2, 3 Melatonin secretion is low or dysregulated in individuals with dementia, with levels of melatonin detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of controls being almost five times as high as those in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.3, 4 In addition, previous randomized controlled trials and case series have found that melatonin significantly improves sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia.5-7 All of these studies had some limitations, such as different definitions of sundown syndrome, small sample size, different settings (home, hospital), and various dosages of melatonin. One study reported that melatonin (n = 24; placebo, n = 17) did not significantly affect sleep, circadian rhythms, or agitation in individuals with dementia.8 It is important to differentiate sundown syndrome from delirium because of differences in treatment and prognosis. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of changes in cognition and behavior, a fluctuating course during the day, and an altered level of consciousness.9 In general, it can be caused by a medical condition, drug or substance intoxication, or withdrawal.9 Delirium may gradually improve as the primary problem resolves or the medical condition becomes stable. Sundown syndrome is characterized by a rapid onset or exacerbation of the usual behaviors that occur every day at the same time, in the late afternoon, evening, or night. Although it has been suggested that physiological and environmental factors contribute to the development of this syndrome, no cause is typically found in most individuals.1 The pharmacological interventions for delirium are better documented than those for sundown syndrome. Sundown syndrome and delirium share many symptoms, but it is not known whether they share the same pathophysiological mechanisms, although the circadian rhythm pathway is implicated in both conditions.2, 3, 10 It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion is associated with postoperative delirium in elderly adults,10 but only two articles were found on the efficacy of melatonin as treatment for delirium in the literature.11, 12 The first reported two cases;11 one was a 53-year-old man successfully treated with melatonin for severe postoperative delirium unresponsive to antipsychotics or benzodiazepines, and the second was a 78-year-old man with a history of postoperative delirium who was given melatonin to prevent another episode of postoperative delirium. He did not develop postoperative delirium on melatonin. The second article reported that low-dose melatonin (0.5 mg/d) given every night for 14 days or until discharge was associated with lower risk of delirium than placebo in elderly adults (n = 72; mean age 84.5).12 Further adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of melatonin in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. Until then, melatonin could be considered a treatment option, especially in individuals who fail to respond to other interventions.

      "title": "Estudio comparativo de la acción psicofarmacológica y analgésica de extractos de plantas de uso terapéutico tradicional con antidepresivos inhibidores selectivos de la recaptación de monoaminas",
      "abstract": "El dolor es una manifestacion clinica frecuente cuyo tratamiento esta lejos de ser optimo, aunque en los ultimos anos se han producidos avances muy significativos. A esto hay que sumar el hecho de que el dolor suele acompanarse de otras enfermedades comorbidas entre las que destacan la depresion, la ansiedad, el deterioro cognitivo y las alteraciones del sueno. Los antidepresivos son farmacos frecuentemente utilizados en el tratamiento del dolor, bien solos o en combinacion con otros analgesicos. Su utilizacion se debe principalmente a dos motivos: por su accion analgesica en algunos cuadros clinicos de dolor neuropatico, y por sus propiedades antidepresivas, logicamente, e incluso ansioliticas en algunos casos. Hasta el momento, no se conoce con exactitud el mecanismo de accion por el cual los antidepresivos producen su efecto analgesico, ni tampoco las diferencias entre ellos en el contexto del dolor. Centrandonos en las investigaciones preclinicas, es necesario de cara a un futuro desarrollo de nuevos farmacos antidepresivos analgesicos, conocer la sensibilidad de los diferentes modelos de dolor a los mecanismos especificos de accion antidepresiva. Los antidepresivos con alguna excepcion suelen ejercer su accion farmacologica inhibiendo la recaptacion de monoaminas, concretamente serotonina y noradrenalina, y este mismo mecanismo parece ser el que les concede actividad analgesica. Asimismo, este mecanismo les hace poseer accion ansiolitica. Es necesario por tanto en psicofarmacologia preclinica, discernir sobre la capacidad de los diferentes antidepresivos para inducir efecto antidepresivo, analgesico y ansiolitico en diferentes metodos que puedan servir para orientar la investigacion futura en este campo. Tambien es necesario conocer su capacidad de producir efectos sobre la cognicion ya que su uso cronico puede derivar en un deterioro cognitivo . Un aspecto de gran importancia y que ha constituido uno de los objetivos de esta tesis es saber el rango de potencia en relacion con la dosificacion de los antidepresivos y su mecanismo de accion como agentes capaces de inducir efecto analgesico y ansiolitico. Es decir, es importante conocer si las dosis a las que se evidencia un efecto analgesico son las mismas a las que se observa un efecto ansiolitico y tambien relacionar este orden de potencia con los efectos cognitivos. Como quiera que el mecanismo de accion de los antidepresivos esta relacionado con la inhibicion de la recaptacion de serotonina y noradrenalina y que los rangos de potencia para inducir este efecto son diferente entre ellos, es de importancia saber que modelos son mas sensibles a un mecanismo u otro. Es decir, es de interes conocer que modelos son mas especificos para detectar un efecto serotoninergico o noradrenergico o los dos, en relacion con el efecto antidepresivo, ansiolitico, analgesico y cognitivo. Tambien es importante, puesto que la mayor parte de los modelos son interferidos por la posible capacidad que tienen los antidepresivos de producir cambios en la motricidad, conocer si los efectos que observamos estan o no relacionados con estos cambios motores, con el fin de no inducirnos a error en futuras investigaciones.",

      "title": "Drugs Highly Associated with Infusion Reactions Reported using Two Different Data-mining Methodologies",
      "abstract": "BackgroundInfusion reactions may mimic drug hypersensitivity, with a spectrum of variability and heterogeneity for both individual and drug; symptoms may include anxiety, diaphoresis, rigors/chills, fever, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, headache, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing/bronchospasm, hypoxia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and death [1][2][3][4].Symptoms usually occur shortly after the infusion begins but can have delayed onset [1][2][3][4].Symptoms may decrease when the infusion rate is discontinued or slowed; at other times, the symptoms persist [1][2][3][4].To add to the complexity surrounding infusion reactions, multiple nomenclatures are used, including drugmediated hypersensitivity, infusion-related toxicity, cytokine storm, cytokine-release syndrome, anaphylactoid reaction, and serum sickness-like illness [2,[4][5][6][7][8].The spectrum of symptoms, variable onset, and the multiple names implicate the immune system.Recognizing the molecular and ontologic mayhem surrounding infusion reactions, we used software technology to investigate drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Advances in information technology allow data integration at many levels; molecular pathways can be visualized through dependency graphs and statistical modeling [9].MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) was developed by Molecular Health to connect biomolecules, pathways, targets and diseases in a drug-centric manner.Drugs highly associated with infusion reactions are reported by MASE using Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs).PRRs are calculated by the ratio of the observed to the expected number of drug-event pairs.The Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) value is the PRR adjusted AbstractObjective: Infusion reactions can be serious life threatening adverse events and have been associated with many drugs and biologic agents.Our objective was to report drugs associated with infusion reactions using two different data-mining methodologies. Methods:The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was data-mined for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Drugs were included if there were >10 reported adverse events and if the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score ≥ 2. Molecular Health's MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) reports Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions and was cross-referenced to improve detection sensitivity.Results: Using FAERS, the highest EBGM scores by class were reported as: pegloticase and α-1antitrypsyn (enzymes), iron dextran and ferric gluconate (electrolytes and nutrients), infliximab and gemtuzumab (immunomodulators), and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (antimetabolites).Using MASE, the highest PRR scores were reported as: idursulfase and galsulfase (enzymes), iron dextran and phytonadione (electolytes and nutrients), gemtuzumab and infliximab (immunomodulators), mercaptopurine and azathioprine (antimetabolites).Amphotericin and vancomycin had the highest scores for the antimicrobial class for both FAERS and MASE. Conclusions:Using the two statistical methods EBGM and PRR, both specificity and sensitivity were preserved.However, neither system detected several drugs with established relationships to infusion reactions, including protamine and nitroglycerine.Reactions caused by these drugs were possibly underreported because the effects have been well established or due to evolution of administration with slower administration.We hope this analysis encourages further research into overlapping mechanisms for infusion reactions.",

      "title": "Positive findings for negative symptoms of schizophrenia: no longer untreatable?",
      "abstract": "Until recently, negative symptoms of schizophrenia have been considered difficult to define, hard to measure, and nearly impossible to treat. Now comes a study from Lecrubier et al. (1) suggesting somewhat counter-intuitively that a low (5 mg) but not a high (20 mg) dose of one of the atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine, may be useful in improving negative symptoms of this devastating illness. This observation emerges from a field currently undergoing a resurgence of interest and optimism about negative symptoms of schizophrenia (2–7). A consensus now exists among experts that negative symptoms of schizophrenia – such as alogia, blunted affect, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition – represent not only a domain of schizophrenia distinct from positive symptoms, but possibly even the core deficit of this illness (2). Furthermore, negative symptoms of schizophrenia may have a different etiology and neurobiology (8) from other domains of this illness, especially from the positive symptoms (2–7). It would not be surprising if negative symptoms therefore require a different treatment approach than positive symptoms, which are undoubtedly improved by the agents that block a high degree of dopamine D2 receptors (9). Disentangling negative symptoms from the other symptoms of schizophrenia and its treatments have never been easy, and the approach taken by Lecrubier et al. is an interesting one. Although negative symptoms usually exist concomitantly and in the same patients with positive symptoms, Lecrubier et al. decided to study patients with almost no positive symptoms. This novel approach intended to eliminate the possibility that any improvement in negative symptoms would be caused by a ‘pseudospecific’ improvement in positive symptoms rather than caused by a true improvement in negative symptoms, a legitimate worry because the two agents chosen for this study, olanzapine and amisulpride, have well-established robust actions on positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Lecrubier et al. found that patients receiving 5 mg of olanzapine showed statistically significant improvements in negative symptoms (in both primary and secondary efficacy measures) compared with placebo. Interestingly, these patients also showed statistically significant (yet clinically unimportant) improvements in their already low levels of positive symptoms. Nevertheless, the authors’ strategy of selecting patients with predominantly negative symptoms seems to have been largely if not fully successful in disentangling the improvement in negative symptoms for 5 mg of olanzapine from the small improvements in positive symptoms at this dose. On the other hand, depression ratings also improved in the 5-mg olanzapine group, so it is possible that the improvement of depressive ratings could have contributed to the improvement of negative symptom ratings. A surprise from this study is that low doses of amisulpride, an agent previously demonstrated – including by this group – to improve negative symptoms, failed to show improvements of negative symptoms here. The reasons for this are unclear, but the 150 mg dose may have been a bit high. One striking outcome of this study is that patients receiving 5 mg of olanzapine, a dose lower than that used to treat schizophrenia in general and positive symptoms in particular, showed improvements in negative symptoms, but patients receiving a standard dose of olanzapine, 20 mg, did not show improvements in negative symptoms. Assuming that this observation is real and replicable, how can olanzapine improve negative symptoms at low doses but not at high doses? One possible explanation for this seeming paradox may lie in the fact that the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, like all atypical antipsychotics, has different receptor actions at high doses than it has at low doses (9). That is, when dosed for treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, olanzapine, like every known antipsychotic, occupies a substantial number (perhaps 70–90%) of dopamine D2 receptors (9). At high doses, olanzapine also fully saturates serotonin 5HT2A receptors, an action presumed to make olanzapine an atypical antipsychotic (9). At high doses, olanzapine also occupies numerous other receptors (9). However, at low doses of olanzapine, D2 receptors are occupied at doses thought to be too low to be useful in treating positive symptoms. At low doses, only the most potent actions of olanzapine come into play. As olanzapine's actions at serotonin receptors, especially actions at 5HT2C and 5HT2A receptors, are more potent than its actions at D2 receptors, these are the pharmacologic actions that may become critical at low doses. Substantial occupancy at serotonin receptors, not substantial actions at D2 receptors, could explain olanzapine's apparent low-dose therapeutic results on negative symptoms. It is known that blockade of these serotonin receptors leads to robust increases in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine in prefrontal cortex, and this could be the action of olanzapine that hypothetically improves negative symptoms (9). This idea is given a boost by recent observations that another agent with more selective actions on serotonin receptors than on dopamine D2 receptors, asenapine (10), may also improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia (11). Although studied in patients with both positive and negative symptoms, asenapine not only improved both positive and negative symptoms, but it improved the negative symptoms better than did risperidone, an agent without the same high-potency actions on multiple serotonin receptors (11). Thus, it may be possible to reconcile the results of low but not high dose olanzapine, as well as the results of asenapine but not risperidone improving negative symptoms, by attributing these clinical results to the unique high-potency actions on serotonin receptors. This idea may be worthy of investigating further with other agents with high potency on serotonin receptors. In order to relieve the disability of schizophrenia and improve long-term outcomes of this devastating illness, it will be necessary to do much better in terms of improving negative symptoms than we have performed to date. The lead from Lecrubier et al. is a good start, but much more robust actions on negative symptoms will be required in order to have a major impact on schizophrenia. Methods have now been suggested for designing studies to augment current atypical antipsychotics with novel agents (2–7). New methods for evaluating negative symptoms themselves are under consideration (12). It is hoped that these developments will lead to an explosion in research for therapeutic agents capable of significantly reducing the burden of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Why Have Drug Treatments Been So Disappointing?",
      "abstract": "The title of this contribution involves two consecutive questions: have the effects of medication in autism indeed been disappointing? And if so, why? The answer to the first question depends on whether one focuses on the core social and communicative deficits of autism, or on various complicating behaviour problems. Attempts over the past decades to develop drugs that specifically improve social and communicative functioning have failed. Among the most ambitious attempts were medical interventions in the endogenous opioid system that were motivated from animal models on the involvement of this system in various aspects of social behaviour. By contrast, medications such as the newer antipsychotics, psychostimulants, presynaptic noradrenergic blocking agents (clonidine and guanfacine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were shown to reduce impairing complicating symptoms of affective instability, irritability, hyperactivity and inattentiveness, aggression, self-injury and stereotypies. The explanation for the medication-refractory status of social and communicative deficits should be sought in at least two related factors: (1) the as yet unidentified neurochemical basis of autism, and (2) the obvious lack of involvement of the main neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin) in the pathophysiology of social and communicative behaviour.",

      "abstract": "The use of a drug to modify a person's behavior for criminal gain is not a recent phenomenon. However, the recent increase in reports of drug-facilitated crimes (sexual assault, robbery) has caused some alarm in the general public. Drugs involved can be pharmaceuticals such as benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam), hypnotics (zopiclone, zolpidem), sedatives (neuroleptics, some antihistamines), or anesthetics (GHB, ketamine); drugs of abuse such as cannabis, ecstasy, or LSD; or, more often, ethanol. Mistreatment of older people, whether it is abuse or neglect, can be classified as physical, psychologic, or financial/material. Several types of mistreatment may occur simultaneously. Very few data are available in the international literature. It seems that mental abuse and neglect are more frequent, but physical abuse such as beating, pushing, kicking, and possibly sexual abuse have also been reported. Drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults can be difficult to detect (active products at low dosages, chemical instability), can possess amnesic properties, and can be rapidly cleared from the body (short half-life). In these situations, blood, or even urine, can be inadequate. This is the reason why some laboratories have developed an original approach based on hair testing. Hair was suggested as a valuable specimen in situations in which, as a result of a delay in reporting the crime, natural processes have eliminated the drug from typical biologic specimens. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in sexual assault. It should not be considered as an alternative to blood and urine analyses, but as a complement. Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry technologies appear to be required for analyses in drug-facilitated cases. The experience of the authors is presented in cases involving the elderly and chemical poisoning.",

The literature supports the etiology as “high loop gain/increased controller gain,” along with central sleep apnea (CSA) associated with common diagnoses (e.g. heart failure). Available data place the adult population prevalence at about 0.05% (men) and 0.003% (women), while up to 11% of patients diagnosed with CSA may be classified as ICSA. Symptoms may include nocturnal choking, witnessed apneas, awakenings with the sensation of shortness of breath, restless sleep, insomnia, non-restorative sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and variable degrees of snoring. Per the ICSD-3, ICSA may only be diagnosed if “The disorder [CSA] is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurologic disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder.” However, a putative diagnosis of ICSA should prompt a comprehensive search for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction without heart failure, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery disease, ischemic central nervous system pathology, acromegaly, and licit or illicit respiratory depressant drug use, which could be a potential cause of CSA. Systematic studies are needed to determine the cost effectiveness of this approach. However, if present, ICSA is excluded and intervention can be initiated for the underlying diagnosis, which may resolve CSA and, importantly, improve outcomes specific to the causative disease. Treatment options for ICSA include devices such as adaptive servo-ventilation or transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation, medications such as acetazolamide, and sleep position training.",

Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use, and should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, carers, therapists, physicians and surgeons have open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.\n\n### Oral/enteral drugs\n\nOral, or enteral medication, can provide systemic treatment for the relief of generalised spasticity via different pharmacological mechanisms.

The cardinal symptoms of depression are pervasive feelings of sadness or anhedonia, accompanied by sleep and appetite changes, feelings of hopelessness, and guilt and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, patients with apathy (with or without depression) exhibit greater deficits on measures of executive function than patients rated as dysphoric, providing additional evidence that the two disorders are distinct.",

      "title": "Surgically Induced Neuropathic Pain",
      "abstract": "In Brief Nerve damage takes place during surgery. As a consequence, significant numbers (10%–40%) of patients experience chronic neuropathic pain termed surgically induced neuropathic pain (SNPP). The initiating surgery and nerve damage set off a cascade of events that includes both pain and an inflammatory response, resulting in \"peripheral and central sensitization,\" with the latter resulting from repeated barrages of neural activity from nociceptors. In affected patients, these initial events produce chemical, structural, and functional changes in the peripheral and central nervous systems (CNS). The maladaptive changes in damaged nerves lead to peripheral manifestations of the neuropathic state—allodynia, sensory loss, shooting pains, etc, that can manifest long after the effects of the surgical injury have resolved. The CNS manifestations that occur are termed \"centralization of pain\" and affect sensory, emotional, and other (eg, cognitive) systems as well as contributing to some of the manifestations of the chronic pain syndrome (eg, depression). Currently there are no objective measures of nociception and pain in the perioperative period. As such, intermittent or continuous pain may take place during and after surgery. New technologies including direct measures of specific brain function of nociception and new insights into preoperative evaluation of patients including genetic predisposition, appear to provide initial opportunities for decreasing the burden of SNPP, until treatments with high efficacy and low adverse effects that either prevent or treat pain are discovered. This article evaluates the effects of traumatic induced neuropathic pain that commonly follows surgery. The complexity of the perioperative period, aside from the surgery itself, can result in chronic neuropathic pain that is not simply from a damaged peripheral nerve but changes in the central nervous system as a result of sensitization of pain.",

      "title": "Impulsivity and Affective Regulation",
      "abstract": "Abstract Impulsivity and affect share important neurobehavioral mechanisms. Impulsivity is a pattern of responses to stimuli without the ability to conform the responses to their context, usually representing either inability to adequately evaluate a stimulus before responding to it or inability to delay the response for a reward. Mechanisms underlying impulsivity overlap substantially with constructs like arousal, attention, motivation, and reward, which are also prominent in regulation of affect. Both impulsivity and affect share relationships with regulation of monoaminergic and amino acid transmitter function. For example, activity of the locus coeruleus is sensitive to unexpected, intense, noxious, or stress-related stimuli. Impulsivity and affective dysregulation are increased by exaggerated or poorly modulated responses in this system. The course of the illness interacts with context-dependent effects on behavior via behavioral sensitization. Repeated exposure to stressors, drugs of abuse, or endogenous norepinephrine release in affective episodes leads to behavioral sensitization with increased impulsivity, affective dysregulation, and substance use. Impulsivity predisposes to, and is increased by, behavioral sensitization. In this context, we discuss impulsivity in depressive, manic, anxious, and mixed states, including suicidal behavior and characteristics of the course of illness that are related to behavioral sensitization.",

      "abstract": "The utility of classical drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) is often limited by issues of lack of efficacy, delayed onset of action or side effects. Psychoactive substances have a long history of being used as tools to alter consciousness and as a gateway to approach the unknown and the divinities. These substances were initially obtained from plants and animals and more recently by chemical synthesis, and its consumption evolved toward a more recreational use, leading to drug abuse-related disorders, trafficking, and subsequent banning by the authorities. However, these substances, by modulation of certain neurochemical pathways, have been proven to have a beneficial effect on some psychiatric disorders. This evidence obtained under medically controlled conditions and often associated with psychotherapy, makes these substances an alternative to conventional medicines, to which in many cases the patient does not respond properly. Such disorders include post-traumatic stress disease and treatment-resistant depression, for which classical drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin and LSD, among others, have already been clinically tested, reporting successful outcomes. The irruption of new psychoactive substances (NPS), especially during the last decade and despite their recreational and illicit uses, has enlarged the library of substances with potential utility on these disorders. In fact, many of them were synthetized with therapeutic purposes and were withdrawn for concrete reasons (e.g., adverse effects, improper pharmacological profile). In this review we focus on the basis, existing evidence and possible use of synthetic cathinones and psychedelics (specially tryptamines) for the treatment of mental illnesses and the properties that should be found in NPS to obtain new therapeutic compounds.",

Family and personal histories did not show epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, or (with 1 exception) previous somnambulism. Electrographic investigation revealed that all patients had normal waking‐sleep cycles but that 4 of them had epileptiform abnormalities on their electroencephalograms. All patients were treated with either phenytoin or carbamazepine, with cessation of the abnormal nocturnal behavior during follow‐up periods ranging from 9 to 48 months.

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

Objectives Presentation of a clinical case of a PNES in a patient with a diagnose of secondary epilepsy, illustrating the relevance of an adequate evaluation, differential diagnosis, and intervention. Methods Description of the clinical case, with brief literature review and discussion. A search was conducted on PubMed and other databases, using the MeSH terms “nonepileptic seizure”, and “epileptic seizure”. Results We report the case of a 45-year-old female patient, brought to the emergency department because of tonic axial and limb nonsynchronous movements, closed eyes, long duration, with immediate awareness, no desaturation, tongue bite, facial flushing, dyspnoea or sphincter incontinency. She was medicated with clonazepam 1 mg and levetiracetam 1000 mg ev. TC-CE had no acute alteration. Bloodwork had no other major alteration except valproic acid below therapeutic levels (her usual medication, along with other antiepileptic drugs, antidepressant and antipsychotic). The antecedents of the patient: mild intellectual disability and an accidental traumatic brain injury in infancy, with secondary epilepsy. She was transferred to Psychiatry department. No electroencephalogram (EEG) was realized, because she had a recent one confirming PNES, and many other emergency observations with the diagnosis of PNES. Conclusions This clinical case showcases the diagnostic difficulties that clinicians face when there is an overlap in symptoms, emphasizing the need to combine patient history, witness reports, clinician observations, and ictal and interictal EEG to help distinguish these different clinical identities.

Discussion: The present review shows the different neuropsychiatric manifestations which could be occur following Cerebrovascular Lesions, like depression, mania, apathy, anxiety, psychosis, etc. Recently the term of Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder has been proposed to unifying terms like pathological laughing and crying, pathological weeping, emotional or affective lability, emotionalism, emotional incontinence, pathologic emotionality or affect, and emotional dyscontrol, terms which are used to describe the same pathology. Also, the term vascular cognitive impairment has been proposed to include the broad spectrum of cognitive and behavioural changes associated with cerebrovascular lesions without dementia. In addition, there are special attention to the study and instrumentalization of the executive functions, theory of mind and empathy, concepts that describe abilities properly human, which also are deteriorated.

      "title": "Night Eating Syndrome Presenting as Anorexia in an Athlete",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Night eating syndrome (NES) was first described by Stunkard in 1955 as \"morning anorexia, evening or nocturnal hyperphagia in a fully conscious state, and insomnia\" (21). Over time, the syndrome has been further characterized to distinguish it from other forms of nighttime eating. Although some debate still exists, NES encompasses a few key behaviors, including evening hyperphagia (or late night eating before initiating sleep) and eating after awakening from sleep (night eating) either in a fully or semi-conscious state (11). This is in contrast to binge eating disorder (BED), which describes episodes of consuming large quantities of food in discrete time periods without control (23), or sleep related eating disorder (SRED), which refers to involuntary nocturnal eating, often of bizarre foods or inedible items, that occurs after awakening (25). Late-night eating also can be found in other diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa or dissociative disorders, but in these cases it is usually a part of a group of symptoms rather than the central problem. The hallmark of NES is a delay of caloric intake until the evening and night hours. Birketvedt revealed that night eaters consume 56% of their daily caloric intake between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., compared with 15% by control subjects (5). The foods consumed during episodes of evening hyperphagia and night eating tend to be carbohydrate-rich (7), with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio of 7:1. Nighttime awakenings are common among night eaters, and >50% of these episodes were associated with food intake, compared with 0% in control subjects (5). CASE PRESENTATION A 19-yr-old college softball player was referred to a sports medicine clinic by her team's strength staff and teammates for not eating during the daytime and a concern for possible anorexia nervosa. For most of the day, she reported a lack of appetite until approximately 3 p.m., when she ate her first meal. A teammate reported her to be seen pushing her food around the plate and not eating. She attempted to restrict calories during meals because of a bloated feeling in the morning. She denied binging or purging activities. She was seen 3 months earlier by another physician for a complaint of insomnia. She denied difficulty with initiating sleep, but experienced frequent nighttime awakenings, on average three to four times in one night. She had one roommate, and she denied excessive noise, poorly regulated temperature, or light disturbances. She did not discuss her nighttime eating with that physician. She also denied nightmares or night terrors. She had attempted over-the-counter sleep aids without improvement in her symptoms. She was started on zolpidem tartrate, which did not diminish the number of awakenings. Upon each awakening she would consume a snack, consisting of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as cookies or crackers, frequently more than 1000 calories over the night. Although she tried to refrain from eating, she felt unsatisfied and unable to reinitiate sleep until consuming food. Generally, she reported being conscious while eating. However, at times she only would become aware of the episodes by the food wrappers surrounding her bed the next morning. After eating she easily returned to sleep, but reawakened 1-2 h later. Her roommate reported having her personal food confiscated by the patient at night and engaging in conversations that the patient could not recall the following day. The following morning after an episode, she experienced a moderate amount of guilt related to her eating and modest weight gain of approximately 7 lb. She admitted to a mildly depressed mood and intermittent anhedonia. She reported anxiety related to increased life stressors over the past few months associated with softball, classes, and a new relationship. She denied having difficulty concentrating or a decline in academic work. However, she noticed decreased endurance and performance during softball practice and competitions, especially with morning activities during which she felt tired, bloated, and groggy. By not eating for most of the day, she often lacked enough energy to complete an entire afternoon practice. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. At the time of the visit about eating disorder concern, she was no longer taking any medication or supplements. She denied a personal or family history of eating disorders. A complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Upon examination, vital signs were normal; height was 5'6,\" and weight was 160 lb. The physical and psychiatric exams were unremarkable. Her Zung depression scale score was 24, and her night eating questionnaire score was 49. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although NES was described initially in the obesity literature, it is not limited to this demographic. The syndrome's prevalence among the general population is estimated at 1.5% (19). Up to 8.9% of obesity clinic patients meet the criteria for NES (16). However, the diagnostic patterns do not appear to be different for obese and non-obese individuals with NES (7). A recent study investigating familial aggregation showed that individuals with NES were more likely to have an affected first-degree relative than control subjects (OR = 4.9) (13). Recently, the link between psychiatric illness and NES has become of interest because of its association with stress and depression. Lundgren et al. found that 12.3% of patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic met the diagnostic criteria for NES and that these patients had a higher rate of substance abuse and atypical antipsychotic use than patients without NES (12). DIAGNOSIS As NES is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV), variance in diagnostic criteria is widely seen in both past and present studies. In a recent evaluation of diagnostic criteria, Allison et al. report that the definition of night eating has ranged from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. to the more general \"after the evening meal,\" while the proportion of total calories consumed has varied from 25% to 50% (2). These inconsistencies create some difficulty in generalizing investigational results to the general population, as well as clearly identifying whether a patient meets criteria for the actual syndrome or is a variant of normal. In reality, many people have episodes of late-night eating, and in households that often spend evenings watching television, after-dinner snacking may be the norm. In addition, there is variation in the average dinnertime among cultures, with the average person in the United States eating between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., while the average person in Europe has dinner between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The question of whether to include NES in the DSM-V has prompted further investigation into the diagnostic tools and criteria currently used. In an attempt to assess two screening instruments, Vander Wal et al. found that use of a single simple screening question had adequate sensitivity but poor specificity to identify patients correctly with NES (24). Additionally, while the NEQ was correlated positively with increasing diagnostic detail, there was an inability to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity with varying cut points. Vander Wal concluded that the difference between eating late at night versus waking from sleep to eat might be the key to distinguishing NES as a true pathologic state. By evaluating several items from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Allison et al. found that three items appear to be core aspects of the disorder: 1) evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal eating, 2) initial insomnia, and 3) awakenings from sleep (4). Their analysis suggests that the presence of morning anorexia and a delayed morning meal added little additional information. The NEQ has evolved alongside research to characterize NES. Developed as a standardized screening tool for diagnosing NES, the current version is a 14-item questionnaire that addresses both behavioral and psychological aspects of the syndrome. The questions investigate the following aspects of NES: morning hunger and timing of first food consumption, cravings, control over eating before bedtime and during nighttime awakenings, percentage of post-dinner food consumption, initial insomnia, frequency of awakenings, associated food consumption during awakenings and awareness during these episodes, and mood disturbance (4). By varying the cut score, Allison et al. calculated that a positive predictive value of up to 77% can be attained (2). While the NEQ has been shown to be an efficient and valid measure of the severity of NES, its primary use is as a screening tool and it should not replace clinical interview for diagnosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In general, it has been recognized that the pattern of intake rather than the total calories ingested is different in NES subjects compared with controls (17). NES has been linked to changes in the circadian rhythm and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Therefore, NES has been described as delayed circadian eating patterns superimposed upon normal sleep-wake cycles (17). An inpatient study by Allison et al. showed a decrease in overnight ghrelin levels, a stomach-derived appetite stimulant, compared with control subjects, whereas insulin and glucose increased at night (1). No difference was found in secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, leptin, cortisol, or prolactin. In comparison, Birketvedt et al. found attenuated secretions of nocturnal leptin (an adipocyte-derived appetite suppressant) and melatonin, whereas cortisol was increased (5). In a small study comparing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone among people with NES and control subjects, an attenuated response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release was observed, suggesting an overexpressed HPA (10). The authors interpret this finding to be a result of the constant stressful stimuli to which people with NES are exposed, but they note that, alternately, it may be a direct result of a fasting state. They hypothesize that the behaviors of disordered sleep and increased nighttime appetite may be related directly to the neurotransmitter alterations that are caused by an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Based upon the observed caloric intake and neuroendocrine assays in a study of 15 women with NES and 14 control subjects, Goel et al. theorized that NES might represent dissociation between a central timing mechanism in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other presumed regulator systems in the central nervous system, stomach, or liver (9). Again, the question of causality arises in interpreting whether the observed differences in ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, insulin, and glucose amplitudes and timing are altered independently compared with control subjects or are results of the abnormal behaviors of nocturnal waking and eating. TREATMENT Researchers have explored several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for NES, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and light therapy. Lundgren et al. demonstrated elevated binding of midbrain serotonin transporters, which may amplify the reuptake of serotonin and impair postsynaptic serotonin transmission (14). This theory can explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are useful in treating individuals with NES. Early studies and case reports related reduction in night eating episodes and decrease in overall caloric intake to both short-term (2 wk) (15) and long-term (6-15 months) (20) SSRI use. In an 8-wk randomized, placebo-controlled study of sertraline for NES, 12/17 in the sertraline group responded to therapy compared with 3/17 in the control group (16). Seven of the 12 responders in the sertraline group had a remission or complete resolution of symptoms, compared with one of the three responders in the control group. This study was different than previous SSRI trials because it included a small number of normal weight subjects. Of these, two of the three in the sertraline group responded, compared with zero of three in the control group. Participants in the study group had a 30% chance of responding at 2 wk and a 50% chance of responding between weeks 4 and 8. Overall, the sertraline group had a significant reduction in the symptoms of NES, including a reduction in nocturnal ingestions (80%), lower caloric intake after the evening meal (32.5%), and weight loss (approximately 1 lb·wk−1). The changes in night eating did not correlate with changes in depressive symptoms, which were modest at baseline. Because individuals with NES report greater levels of depression and anxiety in addition to displaying evidence of elevated stress (increased cortisol and CRH), Pawlow et al. designed a study to evaluate effects of relaxation training (18). The study focused upon the short-term effects on a group (N = 10) randomized to abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation technique (APRT) compared with control subjects (N = 10). Participants in the APRT group reported lower levels of anxiety and stress and higher levels of relaxation immediately after a session, which correlated to lower levels of salivary cortisol. After 7 d of home practice, the significant decrease in levels of anxiety and stress persisted in the APRT group compared with control subjects. The relaxation group also had a significant increase in morning appetite and decrease in evening appetite rating, but had a nonsignificant decrease in days with post-bedtime eating. Bright-light therapy has been suggested as a therapy for weight loss in obese subjects (6). A case report of an obese woman with NES demonstrated resolution of night eating symptoms when exposed to light therapy, in addition to decreased depression scores (8). NES symptoms recurred when light therapy was discontinued. Light therapy's ability to alter the circadian pattern changes seen in NES may explain this therapeutic observation. DISCUSSION We used the following provisional criteria outlined by Birketvedt (1999) (5) to diagnose our athlete with NES: 1) morning anorexia, even if breakfast is eaten; 2) evening hyperphagia, in which >50% of daily energy intake is consumed after the evening meal; 3) awakenings at least once per night; 4) consumption of snacks during awakenings; 5) repetition of provisional criteria longer than 3 months; and 6) does not meet the criteria for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. To our knowledge, there have been no studies or case reports focusing upon NES in the athletic population. However, there is a well-accepted association between sports participation and eating disorders. While determining the true prevalence in athletes has been difficult, one Norwegian study estimated that 13.5% of elite athletes have eating disorders, defined as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, compared with 4.6% in the control population (22). Our patient was diagnosed before the Allison et al. (2009) proposed diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome (3). Our patient fulfilled these criteria as well as the older Birketvedt criteria. With regard to NES, there are specific issues to consider in the athletic population. First, although morning anorexia may exist, athletes may force themselves to eat breakfast to meet the energy demands of early morning practice or competition. Similarly, athletes may appear to have a normal percentage of preevening meal calories, but their calorie requirements may far exceed their intake. As in our athlete, symptoms of underperformance as a result of a negative energy balance and inadequate sleep may be the driving factor to seek medical attention. Finally, although some athletes may notice weight gain, overall they are less likely to be clinically overweight or obese given the intense training required to perform at a high level. Our athlete's initial complaint was of insomnia, and she was instructed initially in basic sleep-hygiene practices. Her nighttime eating was not mentioned on the first visit, and the prescription of a sleep aid may have exacerbated her problem. Once NES was diagnosed, she was started on sertraline (50 mg daily). She was titrated gradually up to a dose of 200 mg daily over the next 6 wk. She was simultaneously sent to the college mental health center for cognitive-behavioral therapy. She went for four visits and reported a significant reduction in symptoms with the treatments. Although she awoke on average once per night, down from the previous three to four times each night, she was usually able to return to sleep almost immediately without eating. She developed regular eating patterns, consuming three regular meals per day with one to two snacks. Her mood improved and anhedonia also resolved. She continued softball participation throughout her treatment, with noticeable improvements and increased consistency in performance once her night eating resolved.",

      "abstract": "Aim Neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, bipolar and schizophrenia frequently exhibit a neuroprogressive course from prodrome to chronicity. There are a range of agents exhibiting capacity to attenuate biological mechanisms associated with neuroprogression. This review will update the evidence for putative neuroprotective agents including clinical efficacy, mechanisms of action and limitations in current assessment tools, and identify novel agents with neuroprotective potential. Method Data for this review were sourced from online databases PUBMED, Embase and Web of Science. Only data published since 2012 were included in this review, no data were excluded based on language or publication origin. Results Each of the agents reviewed inhibit one or multiple pathways of neuroprogression including: inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotrophin dysregulation and apoptotic signalling. Some demonstrate clinical efficacy in preventing neural damage or loss, relapse or cognitive/functional decline. Agents include: the psychotropic medications lithium, second generation antipsychotics and antidepressants; other pharmacological agents such as minocycline, aspirin, cyclooxygenase‐2 inhibitors, statins, ketamine and alpha‐2‐delta ligands; and others such as erythropoietin, oestrogen, leptin, N‐acetylcysteine, curcumin, melatonin and ebselen. Conclusions Signals of evidence of clinical neuroprotection are evident for a number of candidate agents. Adjunctive use of multiple agents may present a viable avenue to clinical realization of neuroprotection. Definitive prospective studies of neuroprotection with multimodal assessment tools are required.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

      "abstract": "Los problemas en la alimentación durante la infancia han sido descritos a lo largo del tiempo por diversos autores. El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento. El propósito de esta revisión es clarificar criterios diagnósticos, y exponer un manejo progresivo de enfrentamiento y tratamiento, con un enfoque multidisciplinario, sin ahondar en la resolución de las causas médicas orgánicas.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

It works specifically in sensitive vulnerable neuronal populations, which are represented by pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. However, tolerance is effective in other brain cell populations as well. Although, its nomenclature is \"ischemic\" tolerance, the tolerant phenotype can also be induced by other stimuli that lead to delayed neuronal death (intoxication). Moreover, the recent data have proven that this phenomenon is not limited to application of sublethal stimuli before the lethal stress but reversed arrangement of events, sublethal stress after lethal insult, is rather equally effective. A very important term is called \"cross conditioning.\" Cross conditioning is the capability of one stressor to induce tolerance against another. So, since pre- or post-conditioners can be used plenty of harmful stimuli, hypo- or hyperthermia and some physiological compounds, such as norepinephrine, bradykinin. Delayed neuronal death is the slow development of postischemic neurodegeneration. This allows an opportunity for a great therapeutic window of 2-3 days to reverse the cellular death process. Moreover, it seems that the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance-delayed postconditioning could be used not only after ischemia but also in some other processes leading to apoptosis.",

      "title": "Delayed Neuronal Degeneration Results from Endogenous Glutamate Excess",
      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes clinical neurological dysfunction that may be acute, fluctuating, or progressive.1,2 The molecular basis for neuronal injury has not been elucidated, although antineuronal antibodies have been identified in some patients. Immune-mediated injury to vessels or to coagulation cascades that cause inflammatory vasculopathies or embolic or hemorrhagic phenomena can produce ischemia and neuron death, as in stroke, seizures, and spinal cord and peripheral nervous system disease.3 Questions about the mechanism of chronic neurological disease in SLE, such as encephalopathy, and cognitive and behavioral disorders, arise when the autoantibody markers for active SLE fail to correlate with the neurological symptoms.1,4,5 (For an alternate opinion, see ref. 6.) Some will argue that this failure amounts to inadequate methodology either in detection of autoantibodies or in detection of a cytokine imbalance that mediates central nervous system injury independent of autoantibodies. Alternatively, chronic or progressive neurological symptoms in SLE may not depend on the activity of the systemic disease. For example, neurologic disease in SLE could depend on nonimmune-mediated factors like infection and toxic effects of medications. There is another possible mechanism that would account for the failure of chronic or progressive neurological disease to correlate with systemic disease. Recent experiments in several different animal models suggest that an initial insult to the brain may initiate a cascade of events that ultimately lead to distal progressive neuron loss. Based on these studies it is possible that an immune insult could initiate injury and become resolved, but the neuron injury could continue in an expanding cascade without the presence of serum markers of immunologic disease. Building on experimental evidence that had demonstrated that the increased excitatory effect of glutamate and calcium influx causes neuronal death, studies on different animal models suggest that after an initial injury, neurons distant from the region of the first injury may die as the excitatory and inhibitory tone changes on downstream glutamate neurons.7–15 One experimental model demonstrated that ischemic or neurotoxic damage to the striatum caused, days later, the degeneration of 50% of the GABA neurons in the substantia nigra,13–15 although the substantia nigra was not damaged by the initial striatal injury. Behavioral changes in the animals correlated with the development of delayed neuronal degeneration.16 One possible mechanism for the delayed degeneration of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata depended on glutamatergic overactivity. A brief review of the critical feature of the anatomy of the striatonigral system shows that the substantia nigra reticulata receives inhibitory afferents from the striatum (caudate-putamen and globus pallidus), and excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the subthalamic nucleus. In the next experiment, ablation of the subthalamic nucleus occurred prior to the striatal injury. The nigral GABA neurons were completely protected from the endogenous excitotoxicity.14 These results suggest a central role for alterations of glutamate activity in chronic progressive neurological disease and raise the question of whether SLE cytokines or antibodies may provoke similar delayed neuronal injury by altering glutamatergic activity. In this hypothesis SLE cytokines or antibodies might affect upstream neurons and initiate a cascade of events that would evolve over a longer time, and lead eventually to neuronal death through overexcitation; alternatively SLE cytokines or antibodies might acutely affect glutamate receptors. This hypothesis would be plausible if SLE determined brain injury-affected neurons with excitatory or inhibitory activity on glutamatergic neurons or if SLE cytokines or antibodies demonstrated an effect on glutamate receptors. In fact, it has been demonstrated in SLE that microinfarcts and larger vessel occlusions destroy cortical, striatal, or thalamic brain regions with afferents to downstream glutamatergic neurons. Also, in SLE, defective regulation and function of interleukin-4, -6, and -10 have been recorded,17,18 and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that interleukin-6 protects neurons against glutamate-induced death.19 Interleukin-1-receptor antagonist also protects against excitotoxin-induced neuron death in in vivo experiments.20 Furthermore, some studies have identified a lymphocytotoxic antibody that cross-reacts with brain tissue.21 The recent finding, however, of autoantibodies to the glutamate receptor in patients with encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome22,23 may set the stage for a discovery of an autoantibody in SLE to the glutamate receptor. These data suggest that the search for the pathogenesis of the chronic neurological symptoms in SLE should also include the possibility that delayed neuronal degeneration may occur after the initial injury and need not necessarily associate with active SLE. Delayed neuronal degeneration might help explain the progressive or fluctuating neurologic impairments in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

Assessment of these case are often not straightforward, and their certification can be some of the most difficult cases that a forensic pathologist can be faced with in respect to the determination of both cause manner of death. Perceived unfair and/or unpopular certifications of these cases can result in professional criticism, allegations of bias, complicity or bias by certifying pathologist, social dissatisfaction/unrest and violent public protests. Recent deaths in custody in the United States (US) are typical examples of this phenomenon. This Chapter outlines the main clinicopathologic considerations that must occur in the pathologic assessment of these cases",

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

This corresponds to a prolonged alteration of the mental state with continuous or sub-continuous generalized spikes or spike-wave discharges on the EEG. The prototype is absence status (petit mal status, spike-wave stupor, minor epileptic status),13,14 where there is clouding of awareness but, presumably, no specific cognitive deficit. Apathy, drowsiness, slowness, inattention, perplexity, strange affect, amnesia, slow speech are the most obvious abnormal behaviors. It is not clear to what degree higher-level mental functions are truly preserved and what new memories can be formed during these episodes: detailed studies are rare.15These NCSE can be phases in primary generalized epilepsies, but may be manifestations of complex partial status epilepticus of temporal or frontal origin.15 In temporal partial status epilepticus, only limited purposeful organized activity and responses to outside stimuli are possible and there is usually a total amnesia for the period. The epileptic nature is recognized by the presence, often subtle, of automatic motor behavior and vegetative phenomena.16,17 A special form of frequent refractory nonconvulsive partial status epilepticus, associated with ring chromosome 20, is probably of frontal origin and, because it is so frequent, should allow exploration of the affected and preserved behaviors and memories during seizures.18,19",

Symptoms associated with use are often indistinguishable from those encountered with a primary mental illness and also include aggression, confusion, and anxiety. For these patients, clinicians rely on physical presentation, symptom(s) onset, and episode duration when evaluating patients.An adult man was involuntarily admitted to inpatient status secondary to reports of bizarre behaviors that included paranoia and psychomotor agitation. Because of the severity of the symptoms, he was unable to participate in the admission assessment. On day 2, he reported having smoked a substance provided by a friend. In addition, he admitted to previous SC use on 3 occasions, with each occasion resulting in an involuntary admission to inpatient status. The course of this admission was unremarkable.A brief overview of psychiatric signs and symptoms of SC use and information to help clinicians are included. The presentation of psychotic symptoms secondary to SC may be consistent with those of psychosis or other substances of abuse. Because of the variability in the symptoms produced by SC use, clinicians are encouraged to consider SC use in the diagnostic evaluation.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

Auditory hallucinations are especially likely to swiftly be considered due to psychiatric illness. An elderly patient with chronic auditory hallucinations without other significant psychopathology nor other symptoms prompted reflection and literature review. Objectives To review differential diagnosis of auditory hallucinosis. Methods Pubmed search for terms: auditory and hallucinosis. Results Hallucinations should be evaluated according to: type, onset and evolution, association with physical and /or neurological symptoms, association with other hallucinations and/or other psychopathology, characteristics. Auditory hallucinations may present along a continuum from tinnitus, simple, verbal, musical. The Pubmed search retrieved articles pertaining to auditory hallucinations associated with: 1. Sensory deprivation; 2. Hearing loss, auditory Charles Bonnet syndrome; 3. Dementia, neurodegenerative disorders; 4. Brainstem lesions; 5. Other central nervous lesions: thalamus, temporal, other; 6. Epilepsy; 7. Tic disorders; 8. Alcohol use disorders; 9. Borderline personality disorder; 10. Others. Conclusions Patients presenting with auditory hallucinosis should be carefully evaluated to exclude non-psychiatric disorders.

      "title": "Psychose et impulsivité : un mauvais mariage",
      "abstract": "L'impulsivité chez le patient atteint de troubles psychotiques se manifeste par une multitude de comportements pouvant avoir un impact majeur sur l'évolution et le traitement de la maladie ainsi que sur le fonctionnement occupationnel et social. Différentes hypothèses expliquant les comportements impulsifs et leurs conséquences pour le patient et son entourage seront explorées. Des approches thérapeutiques sont identifiées afin d'améliorer la prise en charge des patients avec des troubles psychotiques présentant des comportements impulsifs et subséquemment, de diminuer l'impact des conséquences de l'impulsivité. L'impulsivité chez les personnes souffrant de psychose a été peu traitée dans la littérature avant les années 2000. Plusieurs hypothèses peuvent expliquer cette absence, dont la difficulté de distinguer l'impulsivité de l'agressivité ou que celle-ci ait été surtout attribuée aux comorbidités des individus atteints de psychose. Dans la dernière décennie, les recherches portant sur ce sujet ont exploré majoritairement les causes de l’impulsivité (souvent mesurée en laboratoire) et ce, en lien avec des modèles théoriques. Peu d’études cliniques se sont penchées sur le traitement de l’impulsivité, malgré les manifestations cliniques fréquentes de l'impulsivité par des comportements ou des actes mentaux bien précis chez la clientèle présentant des troubles psychotiques. Pourtant, il est primordial de s'y attarder puisque l'impulsivité peut engendrer de lourdes conséquences dont un risque accru d’agressivité et de violence (Barratt, 1991; Barratt &amp; Felthous, 2003; Quanbeck et al., 2007; Volavka &amp; Citrome, 2008) ainsi que de comportements suicidaires (Mann,Waternaux, Haas, &amp; Malone, 1999; Gut-Fayand et al., 2001; Iancu et al., 2010). De plus, elle jouerait un rôle majeur dans le développement et la persistance des troubles de toxicomanie comorbides (Bickel, Odum &amp; Madden, 1999; Dervaux et al., 2001; Krishnan-Sarin et al., 2007) compliquant ainsi le traitement chez les individus atteints de psychose. Malgré l'absence de consensus sur sa définition, l’impulsivité est généralement exprimée par une conduite ou une réaction (à des stimuli internes ou externes) rapide, spontanée, excessive, non planifiée, potentiellement mal adaptée et pouvant être dangereuse qui ne tient pas compte des possibles conséquences négatives pour soi ou autrui (Enticott, 2006; Moeller, Barratt, Dougherty, Schmitz, &amp; Swann, 2001). Par exemple, l’impulsivité se manifeste lorsqu’une personne fournit une réponse avant que la fin de la question ne lui soit complètement posée; lorsqu’une personne manifeste un acte violent sérieux non planifié ; lorsqu’une personne présente sa démission au travail sans penser aux conséquences de cette décision ou lorsqu’une personne rompt son bail de logement pour emménager rapidement avec un nouveau conjoint qu’elle ne connaît que depuis une semaine. Les individus atteints de schizophrénie seraient plus impulsifs comparativement à la population générale (Dursun, Szemis, Andrews, Whitaker, &amp; Reveley, 2000; Enticott, Ogloff, &amp; Bradshaw, 2008; Kaladjian, Jeanningros, Azorin, Anton, &amp; Mazzola-Pomietto, 2011) et certains suggèrent même que l’impulsivité serait un concept central (‘core feature’) de la schizophrénie (Heerey, Robinson, McMahon, &amp; Gold, 2007; Kester et al., 2006).",

      "abstract": "Sleep and wake states involve interaction among many brain centers via multiple neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, hypocretin, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin (wake promoting), and γ amino butyric acid (GABA) and melatonin (sleep promoting). Most medications for insomnia or hypersomnia act on elements of these neural systems. Initial treatment of insomnia includes sleep hygiene measures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is useful. Medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for insomnia act on GABA receptors or on melatonin receptors. A frequent cause of insomnia is restless legs syndrome, which is linked to reduced dopaminergic activity in brain structures; idiopathic restless legs syndrome is best treated with dopamine agonists such as ropinerole or pramipexole. Excessive daytime sleepiness is most often due to insufficient sleep hours or sleep apnea but is also caused by medications, illnesses, narcolepsy, or idiopathic hypersomnia. Stimulants generally act through enhanced dopamine action (amphetamines, methylphenidate) or acetylcholine action (caffeine). Modafinil may act through enhanced central histamine, hypocretin, and possibly dopamine action. A newer agent, γ -hydroxybutyrate (GHB), acts on GABA and GHB receptors to consolidate sleep, improving daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Improving knowledge of sleep/wake mechanisms should lead to more specific and rational treatments for sleep disorders.",

Approximately 65% of patients with cerebral palsy have the spastic type.2 The term does not imply a specific cause. Prematurity, anoxia, infection, trauma, and metabolic or other pathologic processes may be responsible in individual patients.",

      "abstract": "Apresentacao: A Esquizofrenia e um transtorno psiquiatrico complexo de evolucao cronica, caracterizado por uma alteracao cerebral que dificulta o correto julgamento sobre a realidade, tendo sintomas classificados como positivos (por exemplo, alucinacoes e delirios) ou negativos (dificuldades de expressar sentimentos e emocoes e pobreza no discurso). E subdividida em cinco tipos: hebefrenica, paranoide, catatonica, residual e indiferenciada. Neste estudo abordaremos a Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica. A Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, tambem conhecida como desorganizada, e caracterizada por uma acentuada regressao de comportamento, tendo como principais sinais e sintomas estao a infantilidade, discurso incoerente, enfraquecimento intelectual, perturbacao dos afetos, ideias delirantes, alucinacoes, pensamento desorganizado, gesticulacao exagerada, comportamento irresponsavel e imprevisivel, com tendencia ao isolamento social. Geralmente, comeca a ser percebida dos 15 aos 25 anos de idade. A causa ainda nao e totalmente definida, mas hoje sabe-se que se trata de uma doenca quimica cerebral que decorre de alteracoes nos varios sistemas bioquimicos, que sao os neurotransmissores, e vias neuronais cerebrais. Nessa conjuntura, o presente trabalho faz uma analise acerca do diagnostico de Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica de uma jovem assistida pelo Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juventil de Imperatriz – MA e tem por objetivo conhecer o contexto da Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, compreendendo os fatores que ocasionam influencia sobre a mesma, alem de conhecer a realidade da pessoa com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, bem como contexto familiar e alteracoes sociais que esta pode vim a causar, entender o processo de acompanhamento e tratamento da paciente realizado pela equipe multiprofissional do CAPS IJ, com destaque para a Enfermagem e elaborar problemas e intervencoes, visando a melhora na qualidade de vida da paciente. Desenvolvimento: O estudo realizado e descritivo, do tipo relato de caso, pois segundo Parente (2010), tem como caracteristica a descricao detalhada, contendo caracteristicas importantes sobre sinais, sintomas e outras caracteristicas do paciente e relata os procedimentos terapeuticos utilizados, bem como o deslanche do caso. A coleta de dados foi realizada no Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juvenil - CAPS IJ, na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, no dia 27 de Setembro de 2017, com observacao da consulta de Enfermagem com a mae e revisao do prontuario da paciente, entrevista direta com a enfermeira e assistente social da unidade, e ainda com busca eletronica e literaria, incluindo artigos cientificos na lingua portuguesa, para uma abrangente revisao. Foi consultado o prontuario da mesma a fim de compreender as principais causas do ocorrido e propor intervencoes para melhor qualidade de vida. Para a construcao dos diagnosticos/problemas e intervencoes de enfermagem foi utilizado o NANDA 2015-2017 e NIC, para estudos de medicacoes utilizou-se o AME e manual da ANVISA. Resultados: Com a busca desenvolvida, acerca das informacoes e historico da paciente soube-se que a mesma possui 20 Anos, e estudante, reside na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, com pais divorciados e uma irma com 15 anos, foi diagnosticada em 2013, aos 15 anos, com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1). A mae da paciente relata que teve parto normal de 7 meses, porem laborioso – ocorrido na recepcao do hospital, tendo em decorrencia deficiencia na oxigenacao cerebral (hipoxia neonatal) e convulsao. A paciente teve crescimento retardado, veio a andar apenas com 3 anos e falou as primeiras palavras com 4 anos de idade, mas apresentava boa socializacao. Apresenta retardo mental, relata a equipe multiprofissional do CAPSIJ que ouve vozes, ve um homem com capa preta, tem delirios, convulsoes, dificuldade no controle dos esfincteres, apresenta alteracoes na compreensao, alteracoes no humor, dificuldade motora, fala desconexa, em contexto fora da realidade, relata que nunca viu o pai, informacao que, segundo a mae, nao e verdadeira. Fala em namoro, mas de forma infantilizada, grita muito, nao tem paciencia em escutar, possui baixo nivel de atencao e gosta de pintar e ouvir musicas, se ocupando assim, por vezes, durante o dia inteiro. A paciente iniciou acompanhamento apos inicio dos primeiros sintomas na Associacao de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais – APAE, tendo de inicio as seguintes hipoteses diagnosticas: Epilepsia (CID 10 G40), Retardo Mental moderado (CID 10 F71), Transtornos Mentais e Comportamentais associados ao puerperio (CID 10 F53), Transtorno Psicotico Agudo e Transitorio (CID 10 F23) e Esquizofrenia (CID 10 F20).

      "abstract": "Abstract Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders affecting children and adolescents. The diagnostic criteria require the history of one or more depressive episodes in the absence of a history of mania. In contrast to adults, youth may experience predominantly irritable rather than sad mood. The assessment of depression should include a psychiatric evaluation, medical history, and focused laboratory studies to rule out medical and/or substance-related causes. The evaluation should also consider potential precipitants such as recent losses, interpersonal problems, or trauma. The patient should be asked directly about suicidal ideation, plans, and past attempts. Psychotherapy alone or in combination with antidepressant therapy is effective for the treatment of pediatric depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are the most well-studied psychotherapies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line medication class and should be considered in moderate to severe cases of depression.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction is a topic that has received attention in the psychological literature in part because of the role that it potentially plays in binge eating, obesity, and eating disorders. Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Antiseizure medications (ASMs) can be associated with idiosyncratic reactions: rare but serious effects that cannot be predicted by their mechanisms of action or metabolic pathways. Apart from drug rashes (discussed in the previous chapter), these idiosyncratic reactions can include hepatic, pancreatic, hematologic, neurologic, immunologic, or central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. These reactions can be unpredictable, but when they do occur, these typically arise within weeks of drug initiation and may be reversed when the drug is stopped. The management of idiosyncratic reactions depends on the manifestations and severity. Potentially life-threatening reactions warrant rapid drug discontinuation, with initiation of an alternative ASM with little cross-reactivity to prevent seizures. Other reactions can be managed with slower substitutions or with the addition of other drugs.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the work is due to the fact that the professional activities of law enforcement officers in wartime conditions have become as close as possible in terms of content to the performance of combat missions. In this context, the issues of violations of law enforcement officers' adaptation to a new extreme professional environment have become relevant. The purpose of our work was to identify the most informative markers of law enforcement officers' maladaptation in conditions of participation in combat operations. Maladaptation in the work is presented as a violation of a person's adaptation to environmental changes, which is manifested by inadequate reactions to the nature of stimuli. The most common psychological phenomena that indicate a breakdown of compensatory mechanisms of the psyche and precede maladaptive disorders are: nervous demobilization syndrome, stressful search activity, torpid reaction, which manifests itself in a boring, disoriented state; reaction of dissociation of subject and object, indefinite temporary state, illusion of false invulnerability (frivolity, reckless actions, etc.), pseudo-primitivism (indifference, passive submission and apathy), delusion of grandeur in miniature, experience of loss of the future (feeling of inner emptiness and meaninglessness of existence), temporary addictive behaviour (aggressiveness, use of alcohol and drugs, etc.). It has been established that the psychological state of police combatants is influenced by a number of factors, the timely processing of which significantly reduces the level of maladaptive disorders. Such factors include the lack of combat experience and appropriate behavioural patterns, knowledge of what to do in a particular combat situation, necessary developed skills and abilities, clear organization, and, conversely, the presence of a negative example from a commander or reference persons, death, injury of colleagues, and personal level of response.",

Cardiovascular effects are very important and must be prevented: lowered blood pressure, cardiac rhythm disorders, ECG modifications. Side effects may also affect the genitor-urinary system. The risk of glaucoma decompensation induced by increased eye-pressure is very important. Metabolic disorders such as weight gain are to be taken into account.

Acontecem episódios repetidos de hipoxemia e hipercapnia, e com eles o sono torna-se superficial e fragmentado, resultando em distintas complicações ao indivíduo e à coletividade. O objetivo deste estudo foi revisar a literatura quanto às consequências individuais, econômicas e sociais causadas pela SAOS. Identificaram-se diversas complicações da SAOS relacionadas ao indivíduo: (1) alterações físicas e comportamentais: sono excessivo, fadiga, ansiedade, irritabilidade, depressão, redução da libido, diminuição da qualidade de vida, astenia, consequências metabólicas (ganho de peso, diabetes e dislipidemia) e cardiovasculares (hipertensão arterial sistêmica, aterosclerose e doença coronariana); (2) disfunção neurocognitiva: déficits de atenção, percepção, memória, raciocínio, juízo, pensamento e linguagem. Quanto à relação da SAOS e repercussões socioeconômicas, tem-se: (1) aumento do número, proporção e gravidade de acidentes automobilísticos devido à diminuição da concentração do motorista; (2) prejuízos ocupacionais com queda na produtividade, demissões e acidentes de trabalho; (3) prejuízo social: o individuo com SAOS representa também um perigo potencial para toda a sociedade por aumento de imperícias; (4) aumento de gastos públicos e privados: manutenção de rodovias e estrutura de fiscalização e apoio, gastos previdenciários, custos diagnósticos, terapêuticos e hospitalares. A SAOS deveria ser considerada uma doença de saúde pública, dados seus inequívocos prejuízos individuais, sociais e econômicos. Políticas específicas deveriam ser implementadas visando à redução do impacto dessas consequências.",

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

      "abstract": "Abstract As we have already discussed, in much of the assessment of psychopathology the focus is on internal, unobservable processes of which there is only indirect evidence. In chapter 2, we described the signs and symptoms that comprise the main types of psychopathology. We mentioned that in addition to complaints of subjective distress (symptoms), evidence for the presence of psychopathology may also be shown in the form of abnormal behaviour, which may be self-reported by the subject or observed by a clinician/researcher or other informant (observational measures or signs). One such example of this type of evidence can be noted in the examination of children with suspected attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Evidence regarding a subject’s ADHD could consist of both the individual’s own description of their perceptions, cognitions and emotions and of observations by a clinician or, for that matter, by a parent or a teacher. Probably, the simplest way of measuring psychopathology is by the means of questionnaires. The subject or an informant/observer (such as a spouse, a close friend, parent or teacher) answers a series of questions about the subject’s behaviour and experiences, either in a written pencil and paper or computerized form. Some examples of the use of questionnaires are given in more detail elsewhere, particularly in chapters 7,8 and 9.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that some drugs and neurodegenerative processes, such asParkinson’s disease, can cause extrapyramidal side effects (1). Extrapyramidal symptoms (ES) may be drug-induced and due affect tolerance and compliance (2). ES includes akathisia, parkinsonian symptoms (e.g. tremor, bradykinesia and muscle rigidity) and impaired involuntary movements (e.g. acute dystonia and tardive dyskinesia) (3). Especially, antipsychotic drugs therapy (4), antiemetics, and a variety of other drugs (5) can frequently cause severe occurrences and complications (4). Some drugs induced ES are thought to causean imbalance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the nigrostriatal pathway(1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine and doxepine, may have antidopaminergic effect(2). However, antidepressant drugs are not directly acting as dopamine antagonists(6), but some movement disorders symptoms are rarely described as a side effect of tricyclic antidepressants(2). Enuresis nocturna is a multidisciplinary problem worked on by such many physicians as pediatricians, urologists and child and adolescent psychiatrists (7) can cause a significant psychosocial problem for children and their parents (8), which is estimated at 3.8% to 25% (9). That is, there are over 50 million children with enuresis around the world (10). Theaetiology of this condition is not totally known. Medical therapies including imipramine, desmopressin and anticholinergics, behavioural therapy and enuretic alarm devices are proposed to manage this condition(8). TCAs drugs are widely used in the process of managing this condition (11), for instance, Imipramine can reduce wetting in some children and young people (12).Unsal et al. Here we report a case of imipramine induced acute dystonia in an enuretic child. 8- year-old boy with severe torticollis was assessed in our outpatient clinic and. Beforehand, he had been diagnosed as enuresis nocturna by a child psychiatrist and was given imipramine 10 mg/day for treatment. After three days initiating imipramine 10 mg/day, he had severe muscular spasm on his neck. He had no psychiatric and neurological history. Physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistries, blood counts were within normal limits. He wasonly taking imipramine, and no other medication had been used during this three days. He was diagnosed with imipramine induced dystonia and biperiden 5 mg was administered intramusculary. After 45 minutes, it was seen that torticollis was resolved and he was referred to child psychiatry for the treatment of enuresis nocturna.",

Due to the absence of specific symptoms, it is frequently misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder, which delays treatment. The cases of two patients who exhibited psychiatric symptoms and subtle cognitive disturbances (without confusion) as the sole manifestation of frontal lobe NCSE are reported. Both patients were initially treated as psychiatric disorders (depression and anorexia nervosa). The correct diagnosis was established by the electroencephalographic study, in one case after the patient experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and in the other, after failure to improve with supposedly adequate treatment. There are reports of patients with NCSE whose symptoms suggest a psychiatric disorder (inappropriate behavior, emotional disinhibition, perseveration, reduced speech and motivation). This can occur without altered consciousness and symptoms may fluctuate, making the correct diagnosis extremely difficult. This entity can occur at any age and without a previous history of seizures. A high level of suspicion is necessary for prompt electroencephalographic study to confirm the diagnosis. Early treatment will correct the symptoms and significantly improve quality of life for patients and their families.",

      "title": "Sleep-related epilepsies in the course of development in childhood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy, as one of the most prevalent neurological diseases in childhood, has a strong reciprocal relationship with sleep. Sleep-associated epilepsy syndromes in childhood are mostly genetic and can be divided into (a) the group of self-limited focal epilepsies of childhood including self-limited epilepsy with autonomic seizures (SeLEAS) and self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) and (b) (non-self-limited) sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE). Sleep-accentuated (developmental and) epileptic encephalopathies (DEE/EE-SWAS, Landau–Kleffner syndrome [LKS]) are either genetic (possible transition from SeLEAS or SeLECTS) or structural, and they are characterized by continuous bilateral focal or generalized epileptic activity throughout the night with a clinical manifestation of stagnation or regression, in particular of cognition (verbal agnosia in LKS). Epilepsy syndromes with increased seizure frequency after sleep deprivation or with seizures in the transition to awakening include juvenile generalized epilepsy syndromes such as epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCA) or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), but also SeLECTS. Sleep is a very active process: Regeneration, reorganization, and consolidation of memory facilitate development and cognitive functioning. Epilepsy can alter sleep architecture and vice versa, which can appear as a vicious circle in epilepsies that are sleep related. Macrostructural elements of sleep such as sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wakefulness after sleep onset, REM and non-REM sleep fraction, as well as microstructural sleep elements such as slow-wave activity, slope of slow waves, cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), and physiological sleep figures, are important biomarkers with which to understand clinical symptoms such as cognitive stagnation and regression, to monitor treatment, but also to determine prognostic factors and will be an important tool for future studies.",

Major variables that will be decisive also include the agreed-upon goals of treatment. The purpose in removing symptoms may include trying to prevent suicide, restoring work and interpersonal function, or enhancing the patient's capacity to participate in psychotherapy. The patient was in an agitated state, overwhelmed by fearful ruminations to the degree that he could not think clearly, or concentrate on anything including his psychotherapy, and had developed early waking insomnia. Many who need psychotherapy will be denied it to avoid short-term cost.

Perceptual alteration showed some distinct features that were different from acute symptoms of schizophrenia, and was accompanied by mood changes such as severe anxiety and agitation and, in one of the patients, also by extrapyramidal symptoms. Perceptual alteration, as well as mood changes and extrapyramidal symptoms, responded well to an anticholinergic drug, biperiden. Recent studies have shown that SEPA occurred not only in schizophrenic patients but also in patients on long‐term neuroleptic medication for treating other mental disorders. These findings suggest that SEPA is associated with dopaminergic hypoactivity in the brain, which is induced by long‐term neuroleptic medication.",

In many neurological disease states associated with subcortical pathology a similar pattern of dementia exists. The neurobehavioural changes of progressive supranuclear palsy thus typify a clinical pattern which may be referred to as subcortical dementia. The subcortical dementias have a striking clinical resemblance to the dementia which occurs after bifrontal lobe disease. However, the subcortical dementias can be clearly distinguished clinically from cortical dementias, other than frontal dementias. We propose as a tentative hypothesis that there may be common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the subcortical dementias—in particular, disturbances of timing and activation. There are immediate practical implications of this hypothesis: drugs which have an effect on subcortical timing and activating mechanisms may be useful in the treatment of subcortical dementias.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver.

      "abstract": "Abstract Inappropriate use of benzodiazepines is an important public health problem. In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300). Misuse is used to describe patients who use higher than prescribed doses, or obtain medications from a friend or relative for therapeutic purposes.",

A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues. A number of treatment methods have been developed that use behavior modification and cognitive restructuring to facilitate homeostatic and circadian mechanisms of sleep, and to reduce arousal during bedtime. These methods actively engage the patient to implement life style changes, attitudes and beliefs that promote sleep.",

SCT is positively associated with ADHD inattentive symptoms, depression, anxiety, and daytime sleepiness, but is unassociated or negatively associated with externalizing behaviours such as hyperactivity-impulsivity, oppositionality, and aggression. A growing body of research also demonstrates that SCT is uniquely associated with poorer functioning in various domains of major life activities, including academic difficulties (including poor organization, homework problems, and lower grade point average), social problems (especially peer withdrawal and isolation), and emotion dysregulation. SCT is less clearly associated with most neuropsychological performance outcomes with the possible exceptions of sustained attention, processing speed, and motor speed.",

      "title": "Other Uses: Psychosis, Pregnancy, and Status Epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Although ECT was developed as a treatment for schizophrenia, its ease of use, its safety, and the lack of effective treatments for many psychiatric conditions encouraged experimentation with this therapy to treat other disorders. These explorations define a cluster of conditions— acute and chronic psychosis, psychiatric disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period, and intractable seizure disorders—in which ECT has a clinical role. Strongly held beliefs (delusions), abnormal sensory experiences (hallucinations, illusions) that are not based upon reality, and beliefs that others are paying special attention or plotting harm to the subject (paranoid thoughts) impair social functioning and disrupt family life. Thought disorders are the central peculiarity of schizophrenia but are also frequently found in patients with depression, mania, toxic states, and brain disorders. Regardless of the cause or the associated signs and symptoms, treatment can reduce the psychosis. This benefit is often given small notice, however, because ECT is widely regarded as an antidepressant, not an antipsychotic, treatment. The relief of psychosis afforded by ECT varies with the underlying condition. Disorders in thought in patients with depression or mania are readily relieved. Indeed, the more severe form of psychotic depression is relieved more rapidly than nonpsychotic depression. When ECT is used to treat patients with malignant catatonia and delirium, the psychosis is relieved at the same time as the toxic state. When psychosis dominates the clinical condition without other features, schizophrenia is the usual diagnosis. For acute schizophrenia dominated by the positive symptoms of paranoia, catatonia, or excitement, ECT is quite helpful. It is not helpful for the chronic varieties dominated by passivity and withdrawal, the negative signs of the illness. The clinical approach to the diagnosis of a psychotic condition is to exclude other causes for psychosis first and reserve the label “schizophrenia” for the residue of “not otherwise diagnosed” psychotic conditions. While we are able to ameliorate the psychoses in mood disorders and toxic states, palliation and symptom reduction are the best that we can offer other psychotic patients. Electroconvulsive therapy and insulin coma therapy were the main treatments for psychosis at the time when Thorazine and other new antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the 1950s.",

      "title": "P1-290: NEUROTICISM AS A PREDICTOR OF COGNITIVE AND MOOD OUTCOMES IN LATE LIFE",
      "abstract": "Neuroticism is a multidimensional personality characteristic conveying a predisposition to experience psychological distress and negative mood states, and it has received increasing attention as an indicator of worse cognitive and mood outcomes in older adults – with/without major depression. Facets or traits of neuroticism include anxiety, anger-hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, and vulnerability to stress (Eysenck, 1967). There's evidence that higher neuroticism scores in non-depressed adults predispose acute episodes of major depression (via underlying chronic limbic overactivity), and contribute to chronic stress response that induces neuronal dysfunction increasing susceptibility to cognitive decline and dementia (Kj Manning, 2017). As well, neuroticism is frequently linked to worse treatment response in depression. However, the association between neuroticism, depression and cognitive decline is not well established, probably because not many studies were conducted on this matter. Systematic literature search through Pubmed using the keywords neuroticism, late life depression, cognition. We found five studies and one of them was unavailable. Neuroticism is frequently elevated in late-life depression, yet the long-term clinical trajectory of acute major depression superimposed on neuroticism in older adults is not well understood. A study that analyzed this fact (Manning et al., 2018) found that older adults with major depression with high vulnerability to stress (neuroticism trait) experienced a slower rate of treatment response and greater cognitive decline compared with low vulnerability to stress in late-life depression, but not neuroticism alone. A literature research conducted by (Sadeq & Molinari, 2018) found that personality traits are associated with cognitive decline, as well as the diagnosis of late-life depression in older adults. However, (JB Sanders et al., 2014) found no association between neuroticism and cognitive functioning in the elderly, in accordance to (Schroder et al., 1998), study that was unavailable online but, as listed in other papers, found no association either. It's important to knowledge that different methods and scales were used (See table 1).",

Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

      "title": "Some Psychosomatic Aspects of Food Allergy",
      "abstract": "Summary Some patients experience untoward idiosyncratic reactions when they eat certain wholesome foods. Such illness may be caused by psychogenic or allergenic mechanisms, or by both. The relative importance of psychogenic and allergenic factors in the production and continuance of food-induced illness must be estimated correctly in order to plan a correct program of therapy. This paper reports some of my experiences with the treatment of about 600 patients (seen in the past ten years) who had certain food-induced syndromes, with or without associated primary neuropsychiatric disturbances. Foods become endowed with various dynamic emotional meanings according to the person's upbringing, cultural and religious training, and personal life experiences. Psychogenic food reactions may include anger, anxiety, anorexia, depression, euphoria, feelings of security, guilt, hostility, passive-dependent attitudes, pleasure, syncope, and relaxation. The most common untoward idiosyncratic psychosomatic reactions to food include nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort or pain, intestinal cramps, aerophagia, belching, and rarely diarrhea--all being part of the riddance reaction. The symbolic supportive values of certain foods are such that a person may overeat these foods when he is subjected to unusual emotional stresses. Such categories of foods include the \"security,\" \"reward,\" and \"pleasurable association\", foods. An individual may eat excessive amounts of these foods during times of emotional stress, even though they may be the very ones which produce his allergic illness. The fixed food allergy is very well known, but relatively uncommon. The variable food allergy is very common, but not very well known. In the variable food allergy, tolerance for a given food may vary so that at some times small amounts of the offending food will cause an allergic reaction. But at other times the amount of this food which must be ingested to cause an allergic reaction may be very much greater than any amount that the patient would ordinarily eat. Allergic reactions following the ingestion of offending foods have certain characteristics: there is a latent period between ingestion of the food and the appearance of signs and symptoms; the allergic syndrome has a certain pattern of development and regression of signs and symptoms; it has intensity and duration. These properties in part determine the nature of allergic reactions to repeated ingestion of subthreshold and threshold doses of offending foods. With brief postcibal allergic reactions, each ingestion of a threshold dose of offending food is followed by a discrete reaction. Usually there is no summation of subclinical effects produced by ingestion of repeated subthreshold doses. Repeated daily ingestion of threshold doses of foods which give prolonged postcibal allergic reactions will cause a clinical pattern of allergic reaction resulting from summation, fusion, and adaptation to each individual allergic insult, until finally many patients may develop a steady state of allergic reaction. The daily ingestion of subthreshold doses of such foods is capable of causing a clinically obvious allergic reaction through virtual summation of clinically inapparent allergic reactions caused by ingestion of each subthreshold dose. Each primary allergic reaction set off by ingestion of an unknown allergenic food actuates a secondary postnoxious pattern of behavior which becomes an important part of the patient's reaction to the offending food. But if a patient knows he is eating an allergenic food which will make him sick in a specific way, he does not develop the secondary postnoxious behavior pattern. Recurrent episodes of spontaneous food-induced allergic illness occurring at unpredictable intervals cause certain patterns of conditioned responses in humans. Not knowing when he will be well or sick acts as a frustrating cue, in response to which a patient develops the human counterpart of the non-problem-solving behavior described by Maier for frustrated rats. These secondary reaction patterns of behavior often become so prominent and extensive a part of the patient's complaints to the doctor that even an astute allergist at first glance may consider mistakenly that the patient's problems are purely psychiatric. But further careful clinical study of such a patient will show that he is experiencing a primary allergic reaction to an offending food, which in turn sets off a chain of behavior patterns which are the patient's unconscious response to his allergic illness. Sometimes the secondary behavior patterns engendered by intermittent allergic episodes may become so incapacitating to the patient that they constitute his chief health problem. The food-induced allergic mental, fatigue, and pain syndromes are described. These may occur singly or in any combination, and may be associated with any other allergic syndromes. The patient's response to combined allergic and psychological therapy is illustrated by three case reports. As a result of psychotherapy alone, a patient may unconsciously modify his diet so that he includes less of the security, reward, and pleasurable association foods. If he is also allergic to these foods, he will have a remission in his illness as an indirect consequence of psychotherapy. Many patients are relieved of allergic ill health when they abstain from known offending foods. However, some of these patients will have conscious or unconscious needs at certain times to eat allergenic foods which they know will make them sick. The subtle nature of food-induced self-injury readily escapes the attention of the patient's family and friends--and even, sometimes, of his unsuspecting physician. Self-inflicted, food-induced allergic illness can become a recurrent problem until the physician can understand the basic psychodynamics of such self-injurious behavior, and can then help the patient to make better adjustments to life problems. The best management of all patients with food allergies requires both expert allergic therapy and expert psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a devastating group of rare disorders(1) that manifest with increasing action myoclonus, which is also present at rest but activates with stimuli such as noise, light, or touch. Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the diagnostic criteria for hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo to be included in the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD). The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

      "title": "A boy with dissociative symptoms who benefited from biopsychosocial assessment",
      "abstract": "Dissociative disorder is defined in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as “a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity and immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements,” and its prevalence in children is as low as 1.30 per 100,000 population.1 We report a case of dissociative disorder secondary to a combination of psychosocial factors in addition to the developmental characteristics of the patient, both of which have been overlooked. A 9-year-old boy suddenly lost consciousness during class one day and received a diagnosis of suspected epilepsy at another hospital. One month later, during another class, he lost consciousness again after experiencing a tremor in his hands. A close examination revealed no abnormality, and the patient was thought to have suspected psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Various short-lived involuntary movements with impaired consciousness were often observed and gradually increased in frequency, and odd behavior was observed: When the subject of school or home came up, the child would suddenly become “spaced out,” scratch his face with his hands “like an animal,” and mimic “meow” for several tens of seconds, unable to communicate with staff. The neurologist re-examined the patient for neurological diseases including encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy as differential diagnoses. However, various laboratory tests and imaging studies were negative for organic diseases. The fact that positive symptoms appeared only during stress was also suggestive of nonorganic disease. Outpatient treatment was initiated in our department but the patient was admitted to the liaison department for biopsychosocial assessment because of frequent school absences and his mother's increasing fatigue due to difficulties in raising her child at home. During his hospitalization, we conducted a psychosocial assessment by interviewing his mother about his upbringing and developmental history, observing his behavior, and conducting psychological tests. The interviews revealed his rigid thought patterns and sensory sensitivity from early childhood, and the observations of his behavior revealed a lack of nonverbal communication, so we diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. The case formulation based on the assessment results is shown in Table 1. In terms of biology, predisposing factors included cognitive bias—the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children®-Fourth Edition (WISC®-IV) at age 7 years: total IQ, 90; verbal comprehension, 119; perceptual reasoning, 76; working memory, 79; processing speed, 86—and developmental characteristics, such as obsessiveness, sensory sensitivity, and poor communication skills. As psychological factors, the initial seizures and loss of consciousness were considered to have been induced by stress with classmates, such as feelings of inferiority. Because both seizures occurred during group work, when he was being helped by group members with a task he was having difficulty with. As a social factor, there was domestic discord between parents and between siblings. The school was also unaware of the cognitive characteristics and did not take them into consideration in his daily life and learning. The stressors that he experienced therefore included changes in learning difficulty and interpersonal relationships due to his promotion to the next grade. As a therapeutic intervention, risperidone was administered as a biological treatment for the irritability in autism spectrum disorder, and psychotherapy was conducted to explain the disease to the parents and the patient, and to encourage the patient to verbalize the disease. As social treatment, we provided parents with disease education and parent training according to their son's developmental characteristics. We also shared information with the school regarding the school's understanding of the child and reasonable accommodation, including symptoms caused by the child's developmental characteristics, necessary environmental adjustments, and involvement in school situations that would encourage verbalization. After explaining the findings to the patient and his family, the dissociative symptoms gradually resolved during the 2-week hospitalization, and the patient was discharged. Fortunately, his relationship with his family has improved, and he has been transferred to a special-needs class. In this case, “personality switching,” “detachment,” “loss of sense of reality,” and “dissociative convulsions” were present as dissociative symptoms. There have been few case reports of children with dissociative disorders secondary to autism spectrum disorders.2 It is possible that the prevalence of dissociative disorders is low and that many cases, such as the present case, go undiagnosed without adequate evaluation of developmental characteristics as background. The psychosocial factors of pediatric patients with PNES are numerous and complex3 and now that biopsychosocial assessment is mandatory. “Consultation liaison psychiatry” that links psychiatry and physical medicine and provides comprehensive medical care to patients is necessary.4 Although the clinical course and symptoms of this case were atypical and difficult to diagnose, a case formulation5 from a biopsychosocial perspective in collaboration with the liaison department and the neurology department clarified each of the complex overlapping factors, leading to the planning and implementation of an effective comprehensive treatment. Further development of pediatric consultation liaison psychiatry to enhance biopsychosocial assessment would be of great benefit. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

General notes on Tinnitus: 1- Any Tinnitus treatment must be used in connection with counseling and possible other treatment. 2- Tinnitus is a perception of involuntary sound. It must be audible to the person, it originates in the head (McFadden 1982). 3- It is most commonly referred to as ringing in the ears. 4- Produced centrally, with peripheral influences (e.g. Cochlear damage). Exact mechanism(s), or epidemiology is unknown. 5- Noise type can vary from pure tones over modulated noise to crackling sounds that varies significantly with time &amp; Large intensity variations. 6- Not a ‘phantom’ perception for the patient, it is real 7- Tinnitus can be described in many different forms, for example: Ringing, Chirping, Clicking, Pulsating, Continuous, Sudden A-Geriatric tinnitus Presby tinnitus, defined as tinnitus that accompanies the progressive hearing loss of presbycusis; is classified as: type 1 (normal aging affecting the cochlea), and type II (preexistent sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by multiple systemic complaints, especially of sensory ones). B-Pediatric tinnitus has an incidence of 13% in children who passed an audio metric screening test, and 23-60% in those with hearing loss, 44% in secretory otitis media, but only 3% complain spontaneously because that the child considers tinnitus to be a normal event. There is no significant difference between children with tinnitus and those without in terms of hearing level, age, gender, or etiology of the deafness. Despite the fact that often children do not mention it, tinnitus may incite behavioral problems.",

Palinopsia, palinacousis, and related sensorial symptoms have been described. Verbal and motor symptoms include echolalia, palilalia, echopraxia, and motor perseveration. Cognitive disorders induce perseverative behavior, perseverative thinking, including palipsychism, flashbulb memories, and reduplicative paramnesia (also known as \"palimnesia\") and many related perseverative symptoms. We propose a review of physiological phenomena and pathological symptoms involving these perseverative or repetitive characteristics and discuss the potential mechanisms and neural network involved in this productive semiology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hypercapnia or the increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2 ) above normal values (4–6.5 kPa, 30–48 Torr) is often observed in patients with pulmonary disease, patients with a drug‐induced reduction of the ventilatory drive (for example, because of administration of opioid‐like drugs or anesthetics), or is artificially induced to study the ventilatory control system (for example, by increasing inspired CO 2 to study the effects of drugs on this control system). In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

      "abstract": "The selective serotonin-1A receptor partial agonist anxiolytics represent a new class of pharmacologic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). These compounds offer a completely different pharmacologic approach to this disorder from previous medications. The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) anxiolytics buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone, and SM-3997 have several important new and unique features that will be reviewed in this paper. These features include no cross-tolerance with alcohol or benzodiazepines, no evidence of abuse or misuse potential, and no withdrawal symptoms or rebound anxiety on cessation of therapy. The 5-HT1A anxiolytics have no muscle relaxant, sedative, or anticonvulsant properties and do not impair psychomotor functioning. They do have a slower onset of effect than standard benzodiazepines – clinical response is usually noted in 1–3 weeks. The side effect profile is quite different from that of the benzodiazepines. It includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and restlessness. Some patients with GAD who have received chronic ( > 1 month) benzodiazepine therapy may not respond as well to these compounds initially as will patients with no prior benzodiazepine treatment, especially if the benzodiazepine has been discontinued only recently. These compounds, buspirone in particular, have been shown to have excellent maintenance and prophylactic properties and to be well tolerated with long-term therapy ( > 3 months). Because of their unique mechanism of action and side effect profile, and no evidence of misuse or abuse potential or interference with mental acuity, these compounds represent a definite advance in the pharmacologic management of GAD.",

Une des raisons est probablement la confusion sur ce qui peut être attribué à l’âge ou aux effets de l’alcool. De plus, ces derniers imitent certains symptômes d’autres maladies et troubles, par exemple les troubles anxieux, la dépression ou la démence. La plupart des outils de dépistage sont insuffisamment adaptés aux personnes âgées et l’estimation de l’abus d’alcool chez celles-ci varie largement selon les méthodes utilisées. La vieillesse devient également un facteur de fragilisation face à la consommation d’alcool surtout si la personne âgée présente des problèmes de santé. Les alcoolisations sont souvent une réponse à la solitude, à l’isolement ou à la perte de soutien social et à l’anxiété, à la dépression et au stress. L’efficacité des interventions brèves dans le cas d’abus d’alcool chez les adultes âgés a été soulignée par ses résultats.

      "abstract": "Compliance is generally defined as the extent to which a patient adheres to a treatment regimen and, specifically, takes medication as prescribed. While little research is available about the number of patients who consistently skip antidepressant doses, the literature indicates that about 30% of patients discontinue treatment suddenly within the first month. Both missed doses and abrupt stoppage of treatment place a patient at risk for experiencing discontinuation symptoms. A variety of reasons ranging from forgetfulness to lack of knowledge about the importance of taking every dose may lead to nonadherence to an antidepressant regimen. By spending time on patient education, providing reasons why patients should take every antidepressant dose, discussing alternative treatments, and conveying empathy, support for, and understanding of the patient, physicians may be able to minimize noncompliance and consequently decrease the likelihood that a patient may experience discontinuation symptoms. Discontinuation of an antidepressant can cause a patient to be irritable, experience severe dizziness, or act emotionally absent, which may have a sustained adverse impact both on job performance and on family and social relationships.",

According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand.

      "title": "Cytokines, stress and depressive illness: brain‐immune interactions",
      "abstract": "Cytokines, signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated as a contributing factor for mood disorders such as depression. Several lines of evidence supporting this contention are briefly reviewed and caveats are introduced. Essentially, a relationship between cytokines and depression is based on the findings that: 1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin‐1, interleukin‐6, tumor necrosis factor‐α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment, 2) cytokines induce neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes reminiscent of those implicated in depression, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors, 3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by signs of immune activation and by elevations of cytokine production or levels, and 4) immunotherapy, using interleukin‐2 or interferon‐α, promotes depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is argued that cytokine synthesis and release, elicited upon activation of the inflammatory response system, provoke neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Furthermore, such effects are subject to a sensitization effect so that a history of stressful experiences or cytokine activation augment the response to later challenges and hence the evolution of depression",

      "abstract": "SLC25A46-related neuropathy or Hreditary motor or Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type VIB (HMSN 6B) is an autosomal recessive neurological disorder characterized mainly by early-onset optic atrophy resulting in progressive visual loss and peripheral axonal sensorimotor neuropathy with highly variable age at onset and severity. We report a Homozygous pathogenic mutation in SLC25A46 (c.1018C > T) in our index patient and his family members associated with characteristic imaging and clinical features. Eleven year old male presented with insidious onset, progressive vision loss & swaying since 8 years of age. He had no prior admissions or neurology consult, family history was not contributory. On examination (Video 1) gait ataxia, torticollis to left and tilt to right, head tremors and myoclonus with other findings of optic atrophy, hypotonia, impaired joint position & vibration up to ankle with absent ankle reflex were noted. Further findings of Pes cavus was present prompting for further investigation and diagnosis. On investigations routine blood and serology was normal, vitamin b12, serum cortisol and creatinine phosphokinase was normal. Thyroid profile showed markedly raised TSH of more than 100 mIU/L, TPO Antibodies of 971 IU/mL. Nerve conduction study had symmetrical sensory motor axonal neuropathy. MRI Brain (Fig. 1) T2 flair sequence shows hyperintensities in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and T1shows cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 2). In view of his thyroid changes a Diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis was made and started on adequate doses of thyroxine but with no response and due to progression of the symptoms further investigation was carried. Pyruvate- 0.99 mg/dL (0.37–0.88) and Lactate- 9.70 mg/dL (4.5–14.4) levels were done to rule out any mitochondrial pathology including genetics for mitochondrial disorders which were normal. Mother was diagnosed to have hypothyroidism, clinical and neurological examination was unremarkable in her. In view of this varied presentation and a probable asymptomatic carrier state in the mother, whole exome sequencing(WES) was done which identified a Homozygous pathogenic mutation in SLC25A46 (c.1018C > T/p.Arg340Cys) gene, Mother and other unaffected family members were diagnosed as carriers for this pathogenic mutation (c.1018C > T). He was started on conservative management with beta blockers, vitamin E supplements, and gabapentin with limited response. Biallelic missense and loss of function variants in SLC25A46 have been reported to cause optic atrophy, axonal peripheral neuropathy and cerebellar atrophy. Slc25a46 is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and plays an important role in maintaining the mitochondrial cristae and balancing mitochondrial fission and fusion, probably acting in a pro-fission manner. Slc25a46 deficiency has been suggested to be included in the spectrum of optic atrophy 'plus' that are related to defective mitochondrial dynamics.1-4 SLC25A46 loss of-function mutations have also been identified with lethal congenital pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Affected individuals also have cerebellar or pontocerebellar atrophy on brain imaging, and they may show abnormal movements, such as ataxia, dysmetria, and myoclonus. The most severely affected patients are hypotonic at birth and die in infancy.5, 6 The MRI findings of our case and from charlesworth et al, with cerebellar hyperintensities can add as an early diagnostic clue for identifying this rare disorder. It needs further confirmation of this entity but these two cases add more to our clinical knowledge to this complex disorder.7 In conclusion this case highlights the complex heterogeneity and rarity of the presentation with unique features of cervical dystonia and a probable association of Hashimoto's thyroiditis which needs further validation with characteristic association of optic atrophy and axonal neuropathy supporting a clinical diagnosis of SLC25A46-related neuropathy, confirmed by WES with a Homozygous pathogenic mutation in SLC25A46 (c.1018C > T/p.Arg340Cys) gene.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "title": "ASXL3-Related Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ASXL3-related disorder is characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability, typically in the moderate to severe range, with speech and language delay and/or absent speech. Affected individuals may also display autistic features. There may be issues with feeding. While dysmorphic facial features have been described, they are typically nonspecific. Affected individuals may also have hypotonia that can transition to spasticity resulting in unusual posture with flexion contractions of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Other findings may include poor postnatal growth, strabismus, seizures, sleep disturbance, and dental anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ASXL3-related disorder is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ASXL3 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Feeding therapy; gastrostomy tube placement for those with persistent feeding issues; anti-reflux medication and/or fundoplication for those with gastroesophageal disease; standard treatment for epilepsy, joint contractures, sleep apnea, dental anomalies, strabismus and/or refractive error, and developmental delay / intellectual disability. Surveillance: At each visit: Measurement of growth parameters and nutritional status; assessment of developmental progress, behavioral issues, new neurologic manifestations (change in tone, seizure onset and/or frequency), mobility and self-help skills, as well as signs and symptoms of sleep disturbance. Dental evaluation every six months after age three years or as clinically indicated. At least annual ophthalmology evaluation. Genetic counseling ASXL3-related disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Rarely, individuals diagnosed with ASXL3-related disorder have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent. If the ASXL3 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either parent, the risk to sibs is presumed to be low but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the ASXL3 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Typically, \nthese children are at risk for being a danger to themselves or others, and require a safe, \nfully-staffed setting to ensure the stabilization of dysfunction. Placement of children \nand adolescents in residential treatment occurs for a variety of reasons, ranging from \nsevere psychopathology or extreme behavior problems (including legal involvement) \nto significant family dysfunction that interferes with healthy and successful academic, \nsocial, and community functioning. Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders. They often present with symptoms of oppositional/defiant \nbehavior, anger outbursts, severe mood disturbance, anxiety, self-injurious behaviors, \nsubstance abuse, and poor social skills. It is widely accepted that placing children in the \nleast restrictive placement possible is the goal; however, a child’s referral for this level \nof care often results from the need for more intensive treatment than can be obtained \nthrough outpatient means.",

      "title": "Arousal in Nocturnal Consciousness: How Dream- and Sleep-Experiences May Inform Us of Poor Sleep Quality, Stress, and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "The term \"sleep experiences\", coined by Watson (2001), denotes an array of unusual nocturnal consciousness phenomena; for example, nightmares, vivid or recurrent dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations, dreams of falling or flying, confusional arousals, and lucid dreams. Excluding the latter, these experiences reflect a single factor of atypical oneiric cognitions (\"general sleep experiences\"). The current study is an opinionated mini-review on the associations of this factor—measured with the Iowa sleep experiences survey (ISES, Watson, 2001)—with psychopathological symptoms and stress. Findings support a strong relation between psychological distress and general sleep experiences. It is suggested that that they should be viewed as a sleep disturbance; they seem to represent involuntary intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, resulting in aroused sleep. These intrusions may stem from excessively thin boundaries between consciousness states (e.g., \"transliminality\"), or, conversely, they may follow an attempt at disconnecting mental elements (e.g., dissociation), which paradoxically results in a \"rebound effect\". The extent to which unusual dreaming is experienced as intrusive, rather than controlled, may explain why general sleep experiences are related to psychopathology, whereas lucid dreams are related to psychological resilience. In conclusion, the exploration of the interplay between psychopathology and sleep should be expanded from focusing almost exclusively on quantitative aspects (e.g., sleep efficiency, latency) to including qualitative conscious experiences which may reflect poor sleep quality. Taking into account nocturnal consciousness—including unusual dreaming and permeable sleep-wake boundaries—may unveil rich information on night-time emotional states and broaden our definition of poor sleep quality.",

      "title": "Hypnosis as an Adjunct to Anesthesia in Children",
      "abstract": "Most children anticipate the prospect of submitting to surgery and anesthesia with fear and apprehension. Youngsters who have to be given an anesthetic are afraid that something disastrous may happen to them while they are asleep. The child fears not only what he can understand but also what is less understandable, such as will he ever wake up or is he going to be killed? There are many connections in the child's mind between anesthesia, sleep, and death.1 When a child is brought to the operating room heavily premedicated or asleep, without having his fears allayed or his anxieties resolved, he will usually experience a nightmare of restlessness on recovery. During such a confused and stressful state, a child is more subject to psychic trauma than one who will recover quickly and quietly to a state of full consciousness and awareness.2 Sleep disturbances, temper tantrums, hallucinatory phenomena, and dependency reactions have been reported after surgical procedures where anesthesia was administered.3 In order to cope with this situa¬ tion, anesthesiologists in recent years have become more aware and better oriented to the psychological aspects of anesthesia for children.4·5 It is but a short step in inducing anesthe¬ sia in children with the use of stories, music, and flavoring agents to the superior effec¬ tiveness of an hypnotic induction. With children, relaxation by means of hypnosis is worth while. The comparative ease of inducing hypnosis in many children is a surprising finding. More than half of them can reach a sufficient hypnotic depth to permit minor surgical procedures, such as venipuncture, spinal tap, and reduction of simple fractures, to be performed. Hypnosis is a valuable method of inducing anesthesia or achieving basal anesthesia in children.6·7 Hypnotic inductions permit the use of posthypnotic suggestions that render recovery from anesthesia less distressing and more pleasant. Results in such cases are gratifying, because on recovery these children are quieter, more comfortable, and more cooperative than those who undergo anesthesia induced by chemical agents alone. Although hypnosis may be performed suc¬ cessfully in younger children on occasion, youngsters between the ages of 7 and 14 years are the most susceptible. These chil¬ dren usually make good subjects because of their heightened powers of imagination and their ability to play a role or create a fantasy. I try to use the child's own experiences—things with which he is famil¬ iar, so that better imagery can be produced. If children are admitted the day prior to surgery, a visit may be made in the after¬ noon or evening in order to take advantage of the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the child and to ascertain his area of interests. If it is possible to have a pre¬ liminary rehearsal of the hypnotic induction, it will serve the anesthesiologist well. How¬ ever, no attempt should be made to force the situation.

Disulfiram induced delirium is rare in the absence of an ongoing psychosis or a disulfiram- ethanol reaction. We present the case of an alcohol dependent patient who had a past history of both an alcohol-induced psychotic episode (which had resolved completely) and alcohol withdrawal seizure. Following inpatient detoxification and induction on disulfiram, to which he was compliant and maintaining totally abstinent, he developed an acute delirious state 6 weeks after disulfiram. It was characterized by fluctuating disorientation, marked inattention, affective lability, increased psychomotor activity, irrelevant speech, social disinhibition, at times staring, talking to self and gesturing in air, and sleep-wake cycle reversal with evening worsening of symptoms. He was re-hospitalized and symptoms subsided by 72 hours after stopping disulfiram. The diagnostic dilemma associated with such a presentation is discussed, along with the putative mechanisms and clinical pointers.",

Two male patients (aged 41 and 70) with multiple myeloma developed severe, rapidly progressing cognitive impairment (mostly involving episodic memory) and loss of independence in activities of daily living during lenalidomide-based treatment. On withdrawal of the drug, one patient recovered normal cognitive function and independence in activities of daily living, whereas mild cognitive impairment persisted in the other patient. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score was 6 out of 13 for the first patient and 5 out of 13 for the second, suggesting a probable causal relationship between the adverse event and lenalidomide administration. Lenalidomide may induce particular cognitive disorders (notably episodic memory impairments) in some patients.

      "title": "Pharmacological treatment of poststroke pathological laughing and crying",
      "abstract": "A 60-year-old man with left-sided limb weakness after a stroke was referred for assessment and treatment of depression. The patient reported that, after his stroke 2 weeks ago, he has been crying “for no reason” several times a day. He described that the crying spells last several seconds and cannot be resisted. The patient denies depressed mood or symptoms consistent with a mood disorder. On examination, stereotyped paroxysms of crying lasting 5–10 seconds were noted during the interview, incongruent to any emotional themes discussed. The patient was diagnosed with pathological crying and was started on citalopram 10 mg orally at night. On follow-up, he reported that his crying spells stopped within days of initiating the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication.\r\n\r\nPathological laughing and crying (PLC) is one of the most common poststroke affective disorders. The cardinal feature of this disorder is a markedly lowered threshold for exhibiting affective behaviour (crying, laughing or both) that is out of proportion to underlying feelings of happiness or sadness. At an extreme, the expression of affect is completely incongruous to the reported underlying emotional experience. Pure pathological crying is by far the most common presentation, representing approximately 80% of cases of post-stroke PLC. Estimates of the prevalence of PLC vary from 7% to up to 48.5% of stroke survivors, with a greater prevalence found in inpatient populations and during the acute post-stroke period.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is important to consider the presence of a depressive episode in people who present with excessive emotionality, most people with PLC do not have a diagnosable mood disorder, and many do not manifest depressive symptoms at all.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of PLC is unknown. Converging lines of evidence suggest that monoaminergic neurotransmission is altered in those who develop PLC after a stroke.\r\n\r\nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of PLC have been reported in the English literature. In pooled data of 93 people from these placebo-controlled trials of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, 96% of patients who received antidepressant medication demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the number of crying episodes at the end of the treatment trials, compared with 27.5% of patients who received placebo, yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes after a stroke, often within days, rather than the weeks typically expected before antidepressant effects are seen. SSRIs should be regarded as the first-line choice when treating poststroke PLC, given the greater tolerability of SSRIs and their lower propensity to have effects on the cardiovascular system, compared with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. The doses of the SSRI medications that were effective in treating PLC in the studies described above (fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg and citalopram 10–20 mg) are at the low end of the therapeutic range used for treating depression. Case reports suggest that bupropion, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and lamotrigine may be effective for PLC in people who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, SSRIs.\r\n\r\nThere are limited data to guide clinicians on how long patients should remain on treatment. For most stroke patients, the natural history of PLC is for the symptoms to gradually improve over time. However, it is estimated that 10%–15% of people continue to manifest symptoms a year after a stroke. Reports have suggested that PLC can reemerge after discontinuing the antidepressant drug, whereas reinstatement of the medication leads to swift amelioration of these symptoms. The need for long-term treatment needs to be evaluated on an individual basis.\r\n\r\nPeter Giacobbe, MD Alastair Flint, MB Department of Psychiatry University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Toronto, Ont.",

      "title": "Psychedelics and mental health: reimagining care through science, insight, and compassion",
      "abstract": "Introduction In recent years, psychiatry has witnessed a renaissance in the investigation of psychedelic compounds, a broad class of psychoactive substances that induce altered states of consciousness, often characterized by changes in perception, mood, and cognition, which were largely shelved following regulatory crackdowns in the 1970s. The renewed interest is driven by a mounting crisis in mental health treatment efficacy, particularly for conditions labelled as treatment-resistant. As research continues to underscore the limitations of conventional monoaminergic antidepressants, there is a growing openness to alternative paradigms that were previously considered fringe (Wang and Wang 2025). These substances can be categorized into Classic psychedelics (Serotonergic hallucinogens, such as LSD -Lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and mescaline), Entactogens, such as MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), and Dissociative psychedelics such as ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP).Psychedelics are being revisited not merely as pharmacological agents but as facilitators of profound psychological and existential experiences with therapeutic implications. This opinion article explores the current state of evidence, discusses the mechanisms by which psychedelics may exert their effects, and advocates for a balanced, evidence-based integration of these compounds into modern psychiatric care. Therapeutic Potential and Current Evidence Among the most compelling findings is the rapid and enduring antidepressant effect of psychedelics, often after just one or two sessions, especially when combined with psychotherapy, but it is also unclear how much of the effect has to do with the therapy. Increasingly, studies are being conducted with minimal or no therapy (Li and Wang 2025). Psilocybin has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Carhart-Harris et al. (2021) reported that in this 6-week randomized study comparing psilocybin and escitalopram for individuals with persistent mild-to-severe depression, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the primary outcome — the change in QIDS-SR-16 depression scores at week 6. Although secondary outcomes tended to favour psilocybin, the results should be interpreted with caution, as the confidence intervals were not corrected for multiple comparisons, making firm conclusions unreliable. Both groups showed lower depression scores at week 6 compared to baseline, but the lack of a placebo group makes it difficult to determine how much of the improvement was due to the treatment itself. Here, and as in the case of MDMA trials below, we acknowledge the need for an 'active placebo' use with low-dose psychedelics, in order to avoid unsuccessful blinding (Butler at al., 2022, Wen et al., 2024).Similarly, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has shown impressive results in the treatment of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Unlike classic psychedelics such as psilocybin or LSD, which act primarily as 5-HT2A (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) receptor agonists, MDMA operates through a different mechanism. It increases synaptic levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and promotes the release of oxytocin, which may underpin its empathogenic and prosocial effects. The Phase 3 trial by Mitchell et al. (2021) demonstrated that MDMA significantly reduced PTSD symptoms and functional impairment compared to placebo, with a large effect size and favourable safety profile and yet, this was declined by the FDA in the summer of 2024. The juxtaposition between the FDA's \"Breakthrough Therapy\" designation and its subsequent rejection of MDMA-assisted therapy by Lykos Therapeutics in 2024 may seem contradictory. However, \"Breakthrough\" status only reflects preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and the potential for expedited review—it does not guarantee approval. In the case of Lykos, reviewers raised concerns about study methodology, functional unblinding, and safety monitoring. These critiques suggest that psychedelic therapy must meet not only efficacy thresholds but also stringent expectations for rigor, transparency, and real-world feasibility. This tension highlights the evolving regulatory landscape and the need for further multisite trials that balance scientific enthusiasm with methodological conservatism. Mechanisms of Action: Beyond Monoamines Psychedelics primarily exert their effects through agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, leading to a cascade of neurobiological changes. These include increased synaptogenesis, neuroplasticity, and altered connectivity between key brain networks such as the default mode network (DMN), salience network, and executive control network (Vollenweider & Preller, 2020). The transient disintegration of the DMN, often associated with the ego-dissolution experience, appears to facilitate a cognitive reset, allowing patients to revisit entrenched thought patterns with a renewed perspective. This mirrors findings in ketamine research, where rapid antidepressant effects are also linked to neuroplasticity and the reconsolidation of emotional memory (Mikellides et al., 2022). Moreover, psychedelics enable emotional catharsis, insight, and existential re-evaluation, phenomena that are often absent in pharmacotherapy based on chemical symptom suppression. Mikellides et al. (2024) describe the experience as a form of psychological catharsis—a profound emotional release. While some practitioners draw parallels between catharsis and non-ordinary states of consciousness, it is important to distinguish this from a true spiritual emergency. As defined by Grof & Grof, spiritual emergency is more akin to a transient psychotic-like experience marked by identity disruption and disorientation, not merely emotional release (Grof & Grof, 1989; Lukoff et al., 1998). Conflating the two may inadvertently suggest that destabilization is necessary for healing, a notion that carries clinical and ethical risks. Clinical Integration and Challenges Preliminary evidence suggests that the therapeutic context—including set, setting, and therapist support— may influence outcomes with psychedelics. The 'set' refers to the patient's mindset, expectations, intentions, and mental state going into the session; the 'setting' involves the physical and social environment in which the psychedelic is administered. (Gorman et al., 2021, Ko and Lewis 2022). However, the specific contribution of these factors remains unclear in the absence of controlled studies directly comparing drug administration with and without such support. These substances are not stand-alone medications; rather, they function as adjuncts to intensive psychotherapeutic processes. Training therapists and establishing ethical, evidence-based protocols is essential. Additionally, psychedelic treatments remain inaccessible for many due to cost, regulatory hurdles, and stigma and a big portion of the cost is likely to be the labor required to do the therapy (Marseille et al. 2022). These authors demonstrated that MDMA-assisted therapy is not only clinically beneficial but also cost-effective for PTSD treatment. Despite high up-front costs, the intervention yielded substantial long-term savings and health improvements, especially when delivered with a third session.In their 2022 study, Marseille et al. evaluated the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for treating severe or extreme chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States. Utilizing data from a Phase 3 clinical trial, the researchers employed a Markov model to compare MDMA-AT with standard care over a 30-year horizon. The analysis revealed that MDMA-AT, costing $11,537 per patient, could lead to discounted net healthcare savings of $132.9 million per 1,000 patients, accrue 4,856 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and avert 61.4 premature deaths. The therapy was projected to break even on costs within 3.8 years, delivering 887 QALYs by that time. Notably, the inclusion of a third MDMA In review session enhanced both medical savings and health benefits compared to a two-session regimen. Even under conservative assumptions—such as no healthcare cost savings—MDMA-AT maintained an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $2,384 per QALY gained, well below commonly accepted thresholds. These findings suggest that MDMA-AT offers substantial clinical benefits and is cost-saving from a payer's perspective for patients with severe PTSD. However, the authors acknowledge that further research is needed to confirm these results and address potential limitations. Current clinical trials are often conducted in highly controlled academic environments, which may limit generalizability. However, naturalistic studies, such as those involving ketamine (Mikellides et al., 2022), provide encouraging evidence of real-world effectiveness in community settings. Comparison with Ketamine and Other Non-Conventional Treatments Ketamine's entry into psychiatric practice has paved the way for psychedelics. As a dissociative anaesthetic with glutamatergic activity, ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects in patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). It has established a precedent for rethinking what constitutes an effective intervention and challenged the dominance of the monoamine hypothesis (Mikellides et al., 2023). The comparison of ketamine with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in TRD, as explored by Mikellides et al. (2022), highlight that non-traditional therapies can be both effective and safe. Psychedelics are the next logical step in this evolution, offering the potential for deep psychological transformation. who highlight that non-traditional therapies, such as ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, demonstrate both safety and efficacy in treatment-resistant populations. Ketamine induces altered states of consciousness that have shown transformative psychological effects in some patients. Building on this, the field is now exploring classic psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD, which may offer even deeper transpersonal experiences and long-lasting therapeutic benefits.Combination Therapy: Psychedelics and rTMS Emerging anecdotal and clinical evidence (Dębowska et al., 2023) suggests that combining psychedelics with neuromodulatory interventions like rTMS may yield synergistic effects. rTMS, a non-invasive brain stimulation method targeting specific cortical regions, is known to modulate neural circuitry and improve symptoms of depression, OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), and PTSD. In clinical settings in Cyprus rTMS Centres has been used for over 6 years, with growing interest in integrating it with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. The hypothesis is that rTMS may enhance neuroplasticity. This integrative model represents a frontier in personalized psychiatry and warrants formal study. The combined use of ketamine and rTMS (with the Mikellides Protocol) has promising clinical potential, as demonstrated by us (Saabneh et al. 2025, in Press).Psychedelics and Existential Distress in End-of-Life Care Beyond depression and PTSD, psychedelics have shown promise in alleviating existential distress in terminally ill patients. Grob et al. (2011) and Griffiths et al. (2016) found that psilocybin significantly reduced anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer diagnoses. Participants described enhanced meaning, acceptance of mortality, and spiritual well-being following psychedelic-assisted therapy. Comparative Safety and Misconceptions Public and professional scepticism about psychedelics often centres on safety concerns. However, accumulating evidence suggests that, within controlled environments, psychedelics in review are physiologically safe and non-addictive (Zhang et al., 2025, Kumar et al., 2025).Gasser et al. (2022) found that classic psychedelics have an exceptionally low toxicity profile and negligible risk of dependence. Adverse events are rare and usually relate to unsupervised use or underlying psychotic vulnerability. Proper screening, preparation, and integration mitigate these risks. In fact, some experts argue that the relative safety of psychedelics compares favourably with commonly prescribed psychiatric medications..Neuroethical Reflections and the Question of Identity One of the most intellectually provocative aspects of psychedelic therapy is its impact on identity, belief systems, and metaphysical assumptions. Reports of ego dissolution, mystical experiences, and spiritual insight raise questions about neuroethics and informed consent (Letheby 2021). While many patients find these experiences beneficial, some may find them disorienting or even distressing (Yaden and Griffiths 2021). Historical and even recent abuses such as the CIA's MK-ULTRA program, underscore the potential for misuse of psychedelics. Recent public concerns involving high-profile figures highlight ongoing risks of worldview manipulation. The Role of Psychotherapy in Psychedelic-Assisted Treatment The integration of psychotherapy with psychedelic administration has been central to most clinical trials to date. Although many protocols include structured therapeutic support before, during, and after psychedelic sessions, there is a lack of rigorous randomized trials directly comparing drug-alone versus drug-plus-therapy conditions. This limitation makes it difficult to determine whether psychotherapy is essential or simply supportive. A recent commentary underscores this uncertainty. Zamaria et al. (2025) argue that while therapy is widely used alongside psychedelics, its specific therapeutic contribution has not been empirically delineated. Goodwin et al. (2023) similarly question whether the benefits observed in psilocybin trials are due to the drug itself or to the psychotherapeutic framework in which it is delivered. Naturalistic studies of ketamine treatment provide useful insights. For example, Dore et al. (2019) reported significant clinical improvements in patients receiving ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, yet noted that similar outcomes have been observed in patients receiving ketamine infusions without formal therapy. Additionally, Joneborg et al. (2022) highlighted transient neural changes associated with ketamine treatments, suggesting that pharmacological effects alone may drive significant portions of the therapeutic response. Toward a New Therapeutic Paradigm The resurgence of psychedelic psychiatry suggests a turning point in the field. These substances urge us to reconsider the role of consciousness, meaning, and personal narrative in healing. In contrast to the reductionist view of mental illness as mere chemical imbalance, psychedelics promote a reintegrative model where subjective experience, relationship, and insight are central. Such a shift aligns with broader calls in the psychiatric community to rehumanize care. It echoes the principles of compassionate, trauma-informed, and relational psychiatry, where healing arises not solely from neurochemical modulation but through connection, presence, and personal transformation (Mikellides et al., 2023). The Path Forward: Recommendations To responsibly harness the benefits of psychedelics, we recommend the following: 1. Expand Research: Larger, multisite, placebo-controlled trials are needed to refine protocols and determine long-term efficacy and safety. However, it needs to be clarified that in psychedelic research it may be best to use low-dose psychedelics as an active placebo.2. Therapist Training: Establish more widely accessible accredited training pathways for psychedelic-assisted therapists such as MAPS (The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) emphasizing ethics, trauma sensitivity, and integration skills. 3. Policy Reform: Advocate for policies that support compassionate access while upholding rigorous medical standards. 4. Public Education: Combat stigma through evidence-based dialogue that frames psychedelics as tools of healing, not recreation. 5. International Collaboration: Learn from global traditions and practices, especially indigenous cultures that have long employed these compounds for healing. Conclusion Psychedelics are re-entering psychiatry not as recreational relics of the 1960s but as scientifically credible, clinically relevant treatments for some of the most challenging conditions in mental health. Their potential to accelerate healing, enhance insight, and restore meaning makes them uniquely suited to address the deep suffering that characterizes treatment-resistant disorders. As with any powerful intervention, psychedelics demand caution, respect, and a framework of ethical use. But if integrated wisely, they may help usher in a new era of psychiatry—one that prioritizes not only symptom remission but personal transformation, relational depth, and spiritual well-being. The path forward is not merely about approving new molecules. It is about redefining what it means to heal.",

      "title": "Harnessing brain activity at adolescence prevents later schizophrenia development",
      "abstract": "Risk of Schizophrenia originates from neurodevelopmental deficits induced by either genetic factors or environmental stressors.1 The clinical symptoms often appear after adolescence period, which can be predicted by abnormal pattern of brain activities prior to the first psychotic episode.2 Psychological intervention, pharmacological agents, behavioral therapies, and Invasive brain stimulation (eg, DBS) act as potential tools to reduce the schizophrenia development for population at high risk.3-5 In recent decade, noninvasive brain stimulation has been employed as potential treatments against cognitive deficits and negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients.6 Yet it is unclear if noninvasive brain stimulation could prevent schizophrenia development and progression as well. In a recent study by Hadar et al published on Molecular Psychiatry, the authors set out to demonstrate the possibility of adolescent period brain stimulation-based prevention of schizophrenia development.7 The authors created the rat model of schizophrenia with maternal immune activation (MIA), which exhibits prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits (a cross-species behavioral parameter for sensorimotor gating), abnormal discrimination reversal (DR; for excessive switching), enhanced amphetamine-induced activity (AIA; for enhanced dopaminergic transmission), and enlarged lateral ventricle (LV) volumes at adulthood. Considering the importance of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in cognition integrity and feasibility of clinical translation, the authors treated the PFC in adolescent MIA rats with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; twice daily, 20 minutes, 13 days). The authors found that anodal (leading to excitation) but not cathodal/sham stimulation could prevent the development of reduced PPI, fast DR, enhanced AIA, and enlarged LV volume at adulthood. This suggested that tDCS stimulation of prefrontal cortex could prevent development of schizophrenia like behaviors and neuropathological changes in the offspring animals at high risk. Interestingly, tDCS treatment did not reverse all behavioral changes in MIA animals, such as the anhedonia-like behaviors, reduced social behaviors, and reduced parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in mPFC. This suggested that either a stronger stimulation is required for more significant changes, or that PFC stimulation fails to target all neural circuits with pathological changes (eg, deeper limbic areas). It will also be interesting to see whether continuous treatment at adulthood could have additional effects on anhedonia and reduced sociality. The study brings many questions to answer with future investigation. First, what is the mechanism underlying anodal tDCS benefits? It is supposed that anodal stimulation leads to depolarization of cortical neurons and enhance the excitability of the local region.8 It is yet unknown how the brain network is modulated following single or repeated tDCS sessions, and the depth of direct/indirect tDCS effect. Neurophysiological studies with multichannel recording of neuronal activities, or histological mapping with neuronal activity biomarkers (eg, cFos/Arc) would offer such evidences, which might explain the effectiveness of tDCS on some but not all behavioral phenotypes. It will also be helpful to measure the monoamine and neurotrophic factor release levels at multiple sites of the brain following tDCS treatment sessions.9 Second, what is the best time window for this tDCS intervention and how long should it be performed? Is it possible to start treatment earlier than adolescence, and without disruption of normal region functions? Is prolonged treatment better than a fix period? These are important questions to answer for safety cautions before clinical translation. Notably, the anodal stimulation over healthy developing animals actually brought certain behavioral defects in later period; it will be necessary to identify very reliable biomarkers prior to start the intervention. Third, in clinical patients, risk population for schizophrenia is identified with varied early symptoms, associating with abnormal brain activities at distinct neural circuits.2 Whether targeting PFC results in benefits for all subtype of schizophrenia patients, or individualized treatment should be conducted for schizophrenia prevention is to be elucidated. This will require more preclinical studies and clinical trials to verify different possibilities. In sum, the study for the first time demonstrated the possibility to prevent schizophrenia development with brain stimulation, for cohorts at high risk. The abnormal brain activity pattern has been recognized as potential biomarkers for upcoming psychosis, and targeting such changes with pharmacological or physical approaches might be efficient in early intervention. Other brain stimulation approaches (eg, transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS) might offer additional tools for schizophrenia prevention. The study is supported by the Medical Science and Technology Project in Ningbo (2016A37, 2017A10). The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

      "title": "Catatonia",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a range of psychomotor abnormalities. It was first described in 1875 by Kahlbaum (1) who reported 25 patients with a \"brain disease\" characterized by four of the following signs: long periods of immobility, mutism alternating with verbigeration, staring, withdrawal and refusal to eat or drink, negativism, posturing and grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, stereotypy, and waxy flexibility (see Table 1). Kahlbaum observed that these otherwise immobile patients could become very agitated or excited and were often found to have extremes of mood disturbance in the form of \"melancholy\" or \"mania.\" This phenomenon of marked, polar alterations in the predominant psychomotor state eventually led to division of the syndrome into retarded and excited types (2). The excited form has been much more difficult to characterize and distinguish from mania (3). In rare instances, patients with severe motor excitement develop fever, autonomic disturbances, stupor, and rhabdomyolysis and may succumb to cardiovascular collapse. This clinical state has been referred to as lethal or malignant catatonia (4,5) and the clinical and laboratory similarities to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has generated considerable interest and discussion (6,7).",

To be most effective, insomnia treatment should be tailored to resolving underlying causes of the condition and managing specific sleep complaints. Therefore, hypnotic therapy administered prior to bedtime, as is currently recommended for most compounds, is not appropriate for all insomnia patients. Ideally, behavioral interventions should be combined with a rapid-acting agent that can be administered at virtually any time during the night without producing residual effects the following day. Zaleplon, a new non-benzodiazepine sleep medication, provides the clinician with an effective and safe pharmacotherapeutic option for insomnia management. Its rapid rates of absorption and elimination allow for treatment of symptoms when they occur, either at bedtime or later at night, without incurring significant risk for the development of next-day impairment of psychomotor and cognitive functioning.",

The differential diagnosis includes other psychiatric and pervasive developmental disorders, deafness, and profound hearing loss. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Common comorbidities include mental retardation, seizure disorder, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety.

      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

Karya Tulis Ilmiah Studi Kasus, Program Studi DIII Keperawatan, Jurusan Keperawatan, Politeknik Kesehatan Kemenkes Riau. Pembimbing (I) Ns. Nia Khusniyati M, S.Kep, M.Kep (II) Hj. Melly, SST, M.Kes.\r\n\r\nDiabetes Mellitus adalah suatu keadaan dimana tubuh bisa menghasilkan hormon insulin sesuai kebutuhan atau tubuh tidak bisa memanfaatkan secara optimal insulin yang dihasilkan, sehingga terjadi lonjakan kadar gula dalam darah melebihi normal. Pada penderita diabetes mellitus terutama yang sudah bersifat kronik dapat terjadi gangguan atau komplikasi berupa neuropati diabetik, protein uria, kelainan koroner. Pada kerusakan sistem saraf dibagi tiga kelompok yaitu kerusakan sistem saraf perifer, kerusakan saraf otonom, kerusakan saraf motorik. Kerusakan sistem saraf perifer pada umumnya dapat menyebabkan kesemutan, nyeri pada tangan dan kaki, serta berkurangnya sensitifitas atau mati rasa. Sehingga penderita diabetes mellitus lebih tinggi resikonya mengalami masalah kaki yaitu sirkulasi darah kaki ke tungkai yang menurun, berkurangnya perasaan pada kaki, berkurangnya daya tahan tubuh terhadap infeksi. Pada umumnya penderita diabetes mellitus terlambat untuk menyadari bahwa terjadi luka pada kakinya disebabkan gangguan sirkulasi pembuluh darah yang menyebabkan luka tersebut sukar untuk sembuh dan akan menjadi ulkus atau gangren. Tujuan dari penulisan ini adalah mahasiswa mampu memberi asuhan keperawatan secara komprehensif dengan metode kasus yang dilakukan terhadap Ny. J pada tanggal 30 Maret sampai 01 April 2020. Hasil studi kasus ini menyebutkan bahwa Ny. J mengalami diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik dengan empat masalah keperawtan yaitu nyeri, hambatan mobilitas fisik, kerusakan integritas kulit, resiko infeksi.

      "title": "Lithium for Bipolar Disorder: A Re Emerging Treatment for Mood Instability: Low Dosage, Slow Titration Might Mitigate Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Lithiwn is among the most effective therapies for bipolar disorder (BD), and enthusiasm for this simple molecule is waxing. The history of lithium is fascinating, (1) and recent considerations include that this element, the third on the periodic table, has few, if any, industry champions. The recent renaissance is caused by a groundswell of appreciation for the clinical efficacy of lithium and an increasing number of providers who are willing to manage patients with lithium. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Target: Bipolar disorder The target illness for lithium is BD, a spectrum of mood disorders with characteristic features of unstable mood and affect. Shifts in mood include recurrent episodes of mania, which are pathologically energized states with misguided volition and behavior with intoxicating euphoria (or irritability).(2) Psychomotor activity is elevated and out of character; speech and body movements are revved up, with a diminished need for sleep. The social, personal, and vocational consequences often are disastrous. The most common mood state of BD is depression. Depressive episodes consist of pathologically compromised energy and volition with a slowing of bodily functions, most prominently cognition and concentration; a pervasive depressed or sad mood is common but not always present. Presence of mixed states, when features of depression and mania are present simultaneously, is one of the many challenges of treating BD; an elevated volitional or energized state may occur with a depressed, dysphoric mood. Evidence for lithium Efficacy studies of lithium have focused on managing mood disorders, treating mania and depression, and prevention or maintenance care. (3) Most were performed during the 1970s and 1980s, (3) but recent studies have been comparing lithium with other mood stabilizers (4-7) and searching for a genetic basis for lithium response.(8-10) Other researchers have examined the use of lithium to prevent suicide. (11) Some have suggested a neuroprotective effect of lithium, which may have profound implications for neuropsychiatry if valid. (12-14) Results of additional studies, which are at different stages of completion, will clarify lithium use, (15), (16) and characterize the genetic makeup of individuals who respond to lithium. (17) The primary evidence for lithium, however, is for maintenance treatment of BD and for preventing manic and depressive episodes. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Biochemistry and physiology of lithium. rhe biochemical and physiological effects pf lithium are complex, wide-ranging, ind likely to affect hundreds, if not thou-;ands, of genes and gene products. The mechanisms of action remain a focus of aca-lemic pursuit (for a review of hypotheses 7elated to these mechanisms see Goodwin and Jamison(2) and Can et al (18)) Lithium is involved in cell signaling pathways that involve complex molecular mechanisms of inter- and intracellular communication; (19) some neural receptors are down-regulatee (20) and others show inhibition (21) which is thought to be a mechanism of lithium. The hypothesized neuroprotective effect of lithium (22) may be mediated through an increased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain tissue. (14) Recently, investigators using induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons have shown that patterns of calcium-related cell signaling in bipolar neurons are affected specifically by lithium in the culture media. (23) There likely are many mechanisms through which lithium's effects are mediated, including a series of dynamic pathways that vary over time and in reaction to the internal and external environments of the cell and person. The lithium renaissance In the past decade, there has been an increase in interest and use of lithium because clinicians recognize its efficacy and advantages and can monitor serum levels and gauge the patient's response and side effects24 against the lithium level. …",

We consider the relationship between developmental dysphasia and epilepsy, bearing in mind that this association may occur fortuitously, as a consequence of the same cause or taking the epilepsy to be responsible for the language disorder, as seizures or continuously (epileptic aphasia).We assess the relation between developmental aphasia and seizure aphasia in the epilepsies, especially the syndrome of acquired epileptic aphasia of Laundau-Kleffner (LKS). Based on the findings in the literature and a personal series of nine cases, we studied their general characteristics, clinical heterogeneity, associated clinical signs and EEG changes (present in all patients); coexistence of convulsive seizures (67-90%); aetiopathogenic findings invoked but not currently conclusive; negative neuroimaging findings apart from some SPECT and PET data; differential diagnosis; clinical course and prognosis difficult to predict. The pharmacological and/or surgical treatment, complemented by logopedics and psychopedagogics (good results in < or = 50% of the cases), the unpredictable course of LKS has to be assessed cautiously.No direct relation can be confirmed between epilepsy and language disorders, although a relationship may be found in some cases. The hypothesis that LKS, continuous spike-and-wave during slow sleep and partial benign atypical epilepsy are the severe, moderate and mild forms of the same epileptic syndrome is generally accepted. This appears during a phase of maturation in which the brain is particularly vulnerable, and is characterized by continuous spike-and-wave complexes during slow sleep, which lead to cognitive and behaviour disorders.",

A pertinent question herein is whether such substances might adversely affect testimonies of victims, eyewitnesses, or suspects by propelling the formation of false memory and increasing susceptibility to suggestion. In the current review, we amassed all available evidence on the effects of intoxication on false memory formation and suggestibility, including the substances alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, stimulants, hallucinogens, and antipsychotics. Our review indicated that alcohol and cannabis under certain conditions increased the susceptibility to false memories and/or suggestion with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. When intoxicated during an event, alcohol is most likely to increase this susceptibility at high intoxication levels or after a delay, whereas cannabis exerts detrimental effects during acute intoxication but not necessarily once sober. For other substances, ecologically valid research separating different memory phases is needed. Overall, differences between substances regarding false memory effects exist, suggesting that a nuanced approach is needed when dealing with intoxicated individuals in a legal context.",

No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW.

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

      "abstract": "The development of psychotropic chemotherapy with widespread use in the psychiatric clinic for its anxiolytic, hypnotic, antidepressant, psychostimulant or psycho-destructive sedative effects has given rise to a new pathology secondary to increased abuse and accessibility. Their neurotropism is generally exerted on the central nervous system at the level of the complex meso-diencephalo-striate structures, influencing the elementary psychic functions, but also the activity of the whole organism through the neuro-humoral system. The clinical investigation of the patient must be interdisciplinary in nature, as human beings are characterized by a bio-psycho-social unit, in which the various biological and psychological components, influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the social environment, are involved in a special way, which gives an original personality to everyone. There are five fundamental axes, which are usually evaluated: thinking, memory, attention, emotion and behavior. A disorder in any of these axes, intense enough to interrupt the normal activity in more than one operating field over a sufficiently long period of time, is diagnosable as a mental disorder. There is an indication borrowed from internal medicine regarding the acute character (weeks), subacute character (months) and chronic character (years), which is attached to the diagnosis. A small part of the entire psychiatric population suffers from severe conditions, which involve intermittent episodes of severe disinhibition, aggressive behavior and self- or hetero-directed violence. In most cases, we talk about conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder), which do not make him a social predator, although they cause enormous suffering to the individual. This study includes 67 patients with mental illness. While conducting the study, we took into account that the first contact with the patient is essential for the results of the anamnesis, oral examination, risk assessment and provisional treatment plan. In the 67 cases there were performed mycological analyses. It is necessary that dentists have certain knowledge of psychology and psychopathology, in order to understand the mechanism of psychopathological reactions and avoid them.",

Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "abstract": "The neurologic dysfunction underlying epilepsy can predispose patients to psychiatric disorders, and the incidence of both depression and psychosis is increased in people with epilepsy. Depressive disorders are the most frequently recognized psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, but depression in children can be particularly difficult to recognize. Clinicians need to inquire about not only classic symptoms of depression such as anhedonia but also less obvious symptoms such as unprovoked irritability, unsubstantiated complaints of lack of love from family members, somatic complaints, and problems with concentration and poor school performance. The diagnosis of depressive disorders in children with epilepsy and mental retardation is even more difficult. Physicians need to be alert for the presence of iatrogenic depression, which may result from antiepileptic drugs or epilepsy surgery. People with epilepsy are also at increased risk for psychosis, which can be interictal, postictal, or (rarely) an expression of ictal activity. This psychosis can be related to seizure remission (ie, alternative psychosis) or iatrogenic (eg, related to antiepileptic drugs or following temporal lobectomy). Although both antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs have the potential to lower the seizure threshold and increase seizures, careful drug selection, dosing, and slow titration can minimize this risk, allowing treatment to proceed.

      "abstract": "Objective: We reviewed the existing literature on Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD) and enquired about symptoms, diagnosis and treatments proposed in order to assess how concepts, diagnostic criteria and treatment have evolved over the last 10 years. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Results: PPPD is a frequent entity that has been only recently well described. Diagnosis relies on anamnesis; posturography is helpful. High scores of depression, neuroticism and introversion may be a risk factor for PPPD. 25% of cases may be triggered by neurotologic events such as Vestibular migraine, which is more prevalent than Meniere's disease. There are alterations in activity and connectivity in the key central vestibular, visual and anxiety systems. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and especially Sertraline could be the medication of choice. Other SSRI or Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) may be chosen in case of comorbid psychiatric disorders or insufficient response to the first choice medication. Cognitive behavioural therapy, vestibular and balance rehabilitation therapy seem to be effective. Conclusion: PPPD seems to stem from a multi-sensory maladjustment. Symptoms of Vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease and PPPD are often overlapping, stressing the need for more precise diagnostic tools. Cognitive behavioural therapy and vestibular rehabilitation therapy have been recently proved to be effective therapeutic options for PPPD. However, there is little progress done concerning drug-treatments: SSRI and SNRI may help, but there is a need for larger controlled double-blind trials to confirm the effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Background: Awareness while under general anesthesia, and the later recall of what happened during surgery, can be experienced by patients as horrific events that leave lasting mental trauma behind.Patients may have both auditory and tactile perception, potentially accompanied by feelings of helplessness, inability to move, pain, and panic ranging to an acute fear of death.For some patients, the experience of awareness under anesthesia has no sequelae; for others, however, it can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, consisting of complex psychopathological phenomena such as anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, irritability, and depression possibly leading to suicidality.Methods: The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed.Results: In the absence of risk factors awareness phenomena occur in one to two per 1000 operations under general anesthesia (0.1% to 0.2%) and are thus classed as an occasionally occurring critical event.In children, the risk of such phenomena occurring is 8 to 10 times higher.These phenomena are due to an inadequate depth of anesthesia with incomplete unconsciousness.They can be promoted by a number of risk factors that are either patient-related (ASA class III or above, medication abuse), surgery-related (Caesarean section, emergency procedures, surgery at night), or anesthesia-related (anesthesia without benzodiazepines, use of muscle relaxants).Conclusion: Strategies for avoiding awareness phenomena under anesthesia include the training of staff to know about the problem and, specifically, the use of benzodiazepines, the avoidance of muscle relaxants if possible, and shielding the patient from excessive noise.EEG monitoring is effective but provides no guarantee against awareness.If awareness under anesthesia occurs despite these measures, the patient must be given expert, interdisciplinary treatment as soon after the event as possible in order to minimize its potential sequelae.",

      "abstract": "Biological, environmental, behavioral, and social factors can influence sleep and lead to sleep disorders or diseases. Sleep disorders are common, numerous, and heterogeneous in terms of their etiology, pathogenesis, and symptomatology. The management of sleep–wake circadian disorders (SWCDs) includes education on sleep hygiene, behavioral strategies, psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly), instrument-based treatments (i.e., positive airway pressure therapy, hypoglossal nerve stimulation), and pharmacotherapy. Depending on the disease, therapy varies and is executed sequentially or can be a combination of several forms of therapy. Drugs used for SWCDs include traditional sleep- or wake-promoting agents and chronotherapeutic agents. Recently, novel medications, which more precisely act on specific neurochemical systems (i.e., the orexin system) important for sleep and waking, are also increasingly being used. In this review, the pharmacotherapy of common sleep disorders (insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorder, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders) embedded in the overall therapeutic concept of each disorder is presented. There is also an outlook on possible future pharmacotherapies.",

Some symptoms are clustered into syndromes, and provisional operational criteria, such as AD-related psychosis or depression, are proposed to facilitate their study.4,5 These symptoms have serious negative consequences for patients, including compromising quality of life and increasing impairment in activities of daily living. They are also major sources of psychological stress, depression, and burden for the caregivers.6 Studies have shown that these symptoms are linked to elder abuse and are important determinants of the institutionalization of patients with AD.7,8 Neuropsychiatric symptoms reflect the underlying neurobiological changes of the diseased brain, and many can be alleviated by psychotropic medications.9,10 Certain stage-specific patterns of the neuropsychiatric symptoms can be observed during the course of AD,11 and some symptoms may have specific value in the prediction of the disease course. For example, several studies have found that depression is a harbinger of AD;12,13 others have shown that delusions or hallucinations predict clinical or functional decline.14,15Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes cognitive impairment in the elderly not of sufficient severity to meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. It is often a transitional state between normal aging and dementia. Subjects with MCI have memory impairment or other cognitive deficits that may be noticeable to their family. Objective cognitive tests show worse performance than their age-and education-comparable contemporaries. However, their daily function is generally preserved.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

      "abstract": "Hallucinations are sensory experiences that appear real but are created by your mind. They can affect all five of your senses. For example, you might hear a voice that no one else in the room can hear or see an image that isn’t real. These symptoms may be caused by mental illnesses, the side effects of medications, or physical illnesses like epilepsy or alcohol use disorder. You may need to visit a psychiatrist, a neurologist, or a general practitioner depending on the cause of your hallucinations. Treatment may include taking medication to treat a health condition. Your doctor may also recommend adopting different behaviours like drinking less alcohol and getting more sleep to improve your hallucinations",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

Inadequate sleep, either in duration or quality, and altered sleep-wake cycles are common reports in palliative care. The causes for insomnia in palliative care may be related to psychological factors (anxiety or depression), pain, treatment-related toxicity, or other comorbid medical conditions. Untreated insomnia can lead to daytime sleepiness, irritability, depressive or anxious mood, and accidents. Assessment, prevention, and management are addressed. The chapter includes discussion regarding sleep hygiene, the role of exercise, and the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Für die Diagnose der POCD stehen keine einheitlichen Testverfahren zur Verfügung. Die Inzidenz wird daher schwankend zwischen 10 und 70 % unmittelbar postoperativ angegeben, allerdings sind in den meisten Fällen nach 12 Monaten keine Einschränkungen mehr nachweisbar. Patienten mit vorbestehender kognitiver Leistungsminderung sind häufiger betroffen. Ein Zusammenhang mit der Entstehung einer Demenz ist aber bisher nicht nachgewiesen. Die pathophysiologischen Mechanismen sind ungeklärt. Anästhetika oder die Art der Narkose haben keinen entscheidenden Einfluss, ebenso ist die Art des operativen Eingriffs eher sekundär. Die kognitive Reserve des einzelnen Patienten scheint aber einen entscheidenden Stellenwert für das Entstehen einer POCD darzustellen. Therapiemöglichkeiten sind bisher nicht bekannt.

      "abstract": "Confusion and hallucinations in geriatric patients are frequent symptoms and typically associated with delirium, late-life psychosis or dementia syndromes. A far rarer but well-established differential in patients with rapid cognitive deterioration, acute psychosis, abnormal movements and seizures is autoimmune encephalitis. Exemplified by our case we highlight clinical and economic problems arising in management of geriatric patients with cognitive decline and psychotic symptoms.A 77-year-old female caucasian patient with an unremarkable medical history was hospitalized after a fall in association with diarrhea and hyponatremia. Upon adequate therapy, disorientation and troubled short-term memory persisted. Within a week the patient developed visual hallucinations. Basic blood and urine samples and imaging (cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) were unremarkable. With progressive cognitive decline, amnestic impairment, word finding difficulty and general apathy, psychiatric and neurologic expertise was introduced. Advanced diagnostics did not resolve a final diagnosis; an electroencephalogram showed unspecific generalized slowing. Extended clinical observation revealed visual hallucinations and faciobrachial dystonic seizures. A treatment with anticonvulsants was initiated. Cerebrospinal fluid ultimately tested positive for voltage-gated potassium channel LGl1 (leucine-rich-inactivated-1) antibodies confirming diagnosis of autoimmune anti-LGI1 encephalitis. Immediate immunotherapy (high-dose glucocorticoids and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin G) led to a rapid improvement of the patient's condition. After immunotherapy was tapered, the patient had one relapse and completely recovered with reintroduction of glucocorticoids and initiation of therapy with rituximab.Rapidly progressive dementia in geriatric patients demands a structured and multidisciplinary diagnostic approach. Accurate management and financially supportable care is a major issue in rare diseases such as anti-LGI1-encephalitis. Education and awareness about autoimmune encephalitis of all physicians treating a geriatric population is important in order to involve expertise and establish treatment within reasonable time.",

These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness. Further controlled studies would be required to clarify the aetiological significance of the drug in these conditions.",

Ils peuvent se manifester de plusieurs facons, allant d'un simple inconfort en vision de loin ou de pres a des symptomes plus marques tels qu'une fatigue oculaire ou des cephalees. On definit les troubles de l'accommodation soit par : -­ Une perte ou une paralysie de l'accommodation qui s'explique par une gene ou une incapacite a lire de pres sans correction. Il s'agit d'une atteinte du muscle ciliaire et/ou a une mydriase par stimulation du nerf sympathique ou par inhibition du systeme parasympathique. -­ Un spasme d'accommodation a l'origine d'une myopie transitoire. Cela s'explique par la contraction permanente du muscle ciliaire et s'associe, en cas d'origine medicamenteuse, a un myosis par stimulation excessive du systeme parasympathique. Les medicaments parasympathomimetiques induisent ainsi un myosis actif, et les medicaments parasympatholytiques une mydriase passive.

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

These stages represent diverse neurobiological mechanisms that are differentially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use and from positive to negative reinforcement. The progression from recreational to compulsive substance use is associated with downregulation of the brain reward systems and upregulation of the brain stress systems. Individual differences in the neurobiological systems that underlie the processing of reward, incentive salience, habits, stress, pain, and executive function may explain (i) the vulnerability to substance-use disorder; (ii) the diversity of emotional, motivational, and cognitive profiles of individuals with substance-use disorders; and (iii) heterogeneous responses to cognitive and pharmacological treatments. Characterization of the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie individual differences in addiction-like behaviors is the key to understanding the mechanisms of addiction and development of personalized pharmacotherapy.",

      "title": "ESP and Altered States of Consciousness: An Overview of Conceptual and Research Trends",
      "abstract": "Parapsychological phenomena has a long tradition of being associated with alterations of consciousness. This tradition extends from the performances of ancient oracles and other diviners to the mesmeric and mediumistic trance, and to more recent claims in the context of laboratory work that used hypnotic suggestion, dreams, meditation, and partial sensory deprivation. Moreover, there has been a long tradition of spontaneous ESP experiences related to dreams and other states of consciousness that have reinforced such associations. In this paper, I will present an overview of the topic of ESP and altered states of consciousness (ASCs). I will not focus on methodological details or specific findings, but, rather, on trends in concepts and research. Other publications cited throughout this paper provide more detailed information (see, e.g Bem & Honorton, 1994; Hardy, 1989; Honorton, 1977; Krippner, 1991; Krippner & George, 1986; Parker, 1975b; Stanford, 1987, 1992; Stanford & Stein, 1994). For practical reasons, I do not discuss mesmerism nor spiritualism in detail, and I do not address other areas such as the psychoanalytic dream ESP literature (e.g., Devereux, 1953). The discussion here will be limited to developments which occurred between the nineteenth century and the 1990s, with an emphasis on twentieth century developments and those since the 1960s. Although I am not suggesting that there are no differences between specific altered states, nor between the concept of dissociation and that of alteration of consciousness, I use the term ASCs in a general sense meaning any state of mind that differs markedly enough from that which we associate with our normal waking selves (Parker, 1975b, p. 8). Depending on definitions, such phenomena as alternating personalities may be considered a form of consciousness alteration, and body image changes during the ganzfeld experience may be seen as a dissociative process in which physical sensations have been separated from conscious awareness. My concern is not to get into these problems of definition, but to represent trends in the literature and general ideas of authors. I hope that what I present will be used by others to clarify our understanding of these concepts. THE NINETEENTH CENTURY Several movements contributed significantly to interest in the relationship between ESP and ASCs. These were mesmerism, spiritualism, and dynamic psychiatry. (For overviews of these topics, see Ellenberger, 1970; Gauld, 1992; and Podmore, 1902). By the middle of the nineteenth century, mesmerism had accumulated a considerable literature, as seen in the writings of Mesmer (Bloch, 1980) and many other workers in the field (e.g., Braid, 1843; Elliotson, 1843; Petetin, 1808).(1) Many observations also focused on clairvoyance and the like (Elliotson, 1845; Haddock, 1851). This period produced many other claims, such as transpositions of the senses, traveling clairvoyance, face-to-face or distant medical diagnosis, seeing the mesmeric fluid around the mesmerist or between the mesmerist and the mesmeree, induction of trance at a distance, and the so-called community of sensation reported between mesmerist and mesmeree (Dingwall, 1967-1968; Gauld, 1992). Some of these phenomena, especially the claim of mesmerized subjects to see the afterworld or to be in contact with deceased or other spirit individuals, provided a link with the later development of spiritualism. As Crabtree (1988) has argued: In Germany, France, England and the United States, the association between magnetic somnambulism and paranormal phenomena of the spiritualistic type was very strong. Many of the books and articles that appeared wove their way back and forth between the two areas, giving the impression that it was impossible to discuss one without dealing with the other. (p. xv) The development of spiritualism changed the focus from mesmerized individuals to those individuals who, in self-induced trances, claimed to communicate with the deceased, and thus reinforced the idea that ASCs were related to ESP (for a review, see Podmore, 1902). …",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Serotonin toxicity, often referred to as ‘serotonin syndrome,’ is a drug-induced condition due to excess serotonin released from brain synapses, resulting in symptoms that may be autonomic, neuromuscular, and/or cognitive in nature. Most cases involve more than 1 of the following drug regimens: monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), serotonin releasers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). This report is of a 70-year-old woman who presented with confusion and muscle spasms due to serotonin toxicity associated with paroxetine and quetiapine treatment. CASE REPORT:An elderly woman with dementia presented to the Emergency Department with fever, altered mental status, labile blood pressures, and inducible clonus. No known medication dosage increases had been made, nor had any new serotonergic agents been added to the patient’s drug regimen. She underwent a thorough workup in the Emergency Department and later during her hospitalization. A presumptive diagnosis of serotonin toxicity was made early on during her stay, with the etiology attributed to use of paroxetine and quetiapine. Clinical improvement was observed after benzodiazepine administration, discontinuation of offending agents, and a brief cyproheptadine course. The patient survived her hospital stay and was ultimately discharged to hospice care with a return to her baseline level of functioning. CONCLUSIONS:Diagnosing serotonin toxicity requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and can occur in the absence of increased dosage of existing, or initiation of new, serotonergic agents.",

El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria. Se recomienda una combinacion de 5 a 10 mgs de haloperidol mas 4 mgs de lorazepam por via intramuscular cada 30 minutos. El registro del grado de agitacion en una escala de 100 puntos, proporciona la retroalimentacion necesaria para proseguir, revalorar, o concluir el tratamiento, dependiendo de los resultados obtenidos. Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol. Si no se logra la sedacion en menos de seis horas, despues de una dosis total de 60 mgs de haloperidol y 8 mgs de lorazepam, administrados por via intramuscular, entonces se recomienda aplicar la combinacion por via endovenosa.",

Many features that are important in terms of driving adversely affected under the influence of alcohol and substance and therefore impaired driving behavior arises in drivers.The most effective way to fight for preventing this impaired driver behav- ior is the restrictions and regulations imposed on drivers in traffic related to alcohol and drug use. Nevertheless, in the literature, some drivers continue to impaired driving function with a risky traffic behavior, in which the driver personality (risk-taking, thrill-seeking, self-control), psychopathologi- cal (substance abuse, personality disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger and aggression), and many other neuropsychological features are considered to have a relationship with this situation.

      "title": "Leukodystrophy Overview – ARCHIVED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY",
      "abstract": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION IS ARCHIVED. IT IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

However, a few case reports have described neuropsychiatric symptoms following PPI use. In this report, we present a case of visual hallucinations secondary to PPI usage and propose possible mechanisms. In this case, a 65-year-old man with no psychiatric history developed acute visual hallucinations following initiation of omeprazole, in the absence of delusions, paranoia, and other psychotic symptoms. The visual hallucinations began after the patient started treatment with omeprazole and resolved almost immediately upon discontinuation of omeprazole. To treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, omeprazole was replaced with famotidine, and the visual hallucinations did not recur after the omeprazole had been discontinued. No other psychotic signs or symptoms were present in this patient throughout the duration of his hospitalization. Although the scientific literature provides limited information on psychosis related to PPI use, a growing number of case reports and studies in recent years have suggested that neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur after PPI use. It is our hope that this case report adds to the scientific and medical knowledge in this area.",

The EEG shows a generalized spike-wave activity. In status psychomotoricus, the clinical symptomatology varies from case to case. It can be characterized by anxiety, dreamy states or productive-psychotic states with agitation, automatisms and hallucinations. In the EEG a temporal or temporally-accentuated epileptic activity will be recorded. Transitional and mixed forms of petit mal status and status psychomotoricus can also be found. I.v. injections of benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam) are an appropriate therapy for any type of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Phenytoin is indicated in status psychomotoricus, but contra-indicated in the case of petit mal status.",

Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

The most common nerve affected is the mandibular nerve, which may be injured during either implant surgery or bone grafting procedures. However, no organized protocol directed specifically for general dentists, or for the vast majority of specialists, has been published. The protocol presented in this article is divided into 5 periods: during surgery (1) nerve injury is suspected or (2) known nerve transection, post-operative period (3) 1 week and (4) 12 weeks. The appropriate treatment (pharmacology, monitoring, etc.) for each period is suggested, including the referral to a nerve specialist when appropriate.",

In this paper, psychogenic movement disorders captured in the WWI film footage ''War Neuroses'' is reanalyzed. <strong>Methods:</strong> Two movement disorders specialists re-examined film images of 21 WWI patients with various and presumed psychogenic manifestations, pre- and post treatment. The film was recorded by Arthur Hurst, a general physician with an interest in neurology. <strong>Results:</strong> All 21 subjects were males, and all presented with symptoms relating to war trauma or a psychological stressor (e.g., being buried, shrapnel wounds, concussion, or trench fever). The most common presenting feature was a gait disorder, either pure or mixed with another movement disorder (15), followed by retrograde amnesia (2), abnormal postures (pure dystonia) (1), facial spasm (1), head tremor (1), ''hyperthyroidism-hyperadrenalism'' (1). Nineteen patients received treatment, and the treatment was identified in nine cases. In most cases, treatment was short and patients improved almost immediately. Occupational therapy was the most common treatment. Other effective methods were hypnosis (1), relaxation (1), passive movements (2), and probable ''persuasion and re-education'' (6). <strong>Discussion:</strong> The high success rate in treating psychogenic disorders in Hurst's film would be considered impressive by modern standards, and has raised doubt in recent years as to whether parts of the film were staged and/or acted.",

      "title": "Reactive psychoses revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided.Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination.Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "title": "[Diagnosis and therapy of behavior disorders in dementia].",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common brain disorder in the elderly. In most patients who develop dementia the core syndrome of cognitive dysfunction is superimposed over the course of the disease by behavioral disorders that manifest at least temporarily to varying degrees. These include depression, anxiety, agitation, restlessness, aggression, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, delusions and hallucinations. Classical psychiatric exploration can be complemented by the use of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) which allows structured diagnosis and comparative documentation of the clinical course. The majority of psychotropic drugs used in psychogeriatics have not been specifically developed for or tested in elderly, often multimorbid patients. Substances used in psychogeriatrics are subject to special requirements due to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes specific to very old persons. They must show clinical efficacy and a low rate of cardiovascular, peripheral and central anticholinergic effects, a low delirogenic potential and favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Most of the newer atypical neuroleptics (e.g. risperidone) and the newer antidepressants (e.g. from the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, or selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, SNRIs) tend to fulfill these criteria better than the high-potency neuroleptics of the butyrophene type (e.g. haloperidol) or the tricyclic antidepressants. For that reason, these newer products should usually be preferred over the conventional agents.",

      "title": "Psychedelics action and schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychedelics are compounds acting by serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A receptor activation and induce several behavioral responses. They are of special interest because of their positive effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder). However, several findings revealed that some psychedelic actions are similar to symptoms observed in schizophrenia (psychosis, sensorimotor gating impairments, attention, and working memory deficits) which might limit their clinical applications. Psychedelics activate some neurotransmitters, i.e., serotonergic, and glutamatergic, that are also impaired in schizophrenia. Therefore, the neurobiological background of psychedelics and schizophrenia is partially similar. Another important aspect to discuss is the perspective of using psychedelics in schizophrenia therapy. Postmortem studies showed a loss of synapses in schizophrenia, and the positive effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity (synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuritogenesis) might be essential in the context of schizophrenia therapy. However, because of psychedelics' psychotic action, the recommended doses of psychedelics in schizophrenia treatment are not established, and subpsychedelic dosing or microdosing are considered. Exploratory studies are needed to determine the tolerability of treatment and appropriate dosing regimen. Another therapeutic option is using non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogs that also induce neuroplastic outcomes but do not have psychotogenic effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to recognize the potential effectiveness of 5-HT 2A agonists in schizophrenia therapy.",

      "abstract": "Il est classique de dire que le deuil va entraîner des conséquences biopsychosociales. Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil. La prise en charge doit mettre le deuil au centre de la réflexion : – en traitant l’individu, en appréciant : ∘ la spécificité de son deuil : pré-deuil, deuil « blanc », deuil « non élaboré », deuil de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, de l’adulte, de la personne âgée voire très âgée, les circonstances de la mort du proche : mort d’un enfant, mort par suicide, par homicide, par accident survenant pendant un transport (voiture, train, bateau, etc.) après une catastrophe naturelle, si la mort est brutale et que la personne y a assisté ou si elle a failli elle-même mourir ; – en traitant le groupe : ∘ familial avec une approche transgénérationnelle, ∘ d’individus bénéficiant d’une prise en charge groupale : avec un même type d’endeuillés ou avec des endeuillés de causes différentes.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ?

Some anti epileptic drugs may aggravate an epileptic syndrome. In 10-15% of patients with epilepsy, better control of seizures can be achieved with combination therapy. These patients are at greater risk of suffering clinically serious interactions. Drug interactions occur at the pharmacokinetic level and at the pharmacodynamic level, involving synergistic or antagonistic effects. Finally many drugs can interfere with the antiepileptic drug metabolism. The inverse effect is also frequent.

      "abstract": "Article AbstractBackground: Hypomania or mania have rarely been reported to develop shortly after the discontinuation of an antidepressant drug. The true incidence of this discontinuation syndrome is unknown because it may be underreported as a consequence of underrecognition or misattribution. This article examines the possible etiology, nosology, mechanisms, and other aspects of the syndrome. Data Sources and Study Selection: A PubMed search was conducted in May 2003 and repeated in January 2004 using the search terms antidepressant and mania. Relevant articles containing adequate descriptions for presentation were retrieved, and their reference lists were hand-searched for further pertinent material. Hand-searches of the indexes of leading psychiatry journals were also performed for the years 1998-2003. Twenty-three articles were identified for review. Conclusions: Antidepressant-withdrawal hypomania or mania may occur rarely with almost any antidepressant drug after sudden withdrawal, tapered discontinuation, or even merely a decrease in dose. The syndrome may be self-limiting, may abate with the reinstitution of the antidepressant drug, or may require specific antimanic treatments; mood stabilizers do not necessarily protect against the syndrome. The true incidence of the syndrome is unknown. Narrow and broad diagnostic criteria are proposed for the syndrome, and a synthesis of literature is provided.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

Self-medication of mood disorders with legal or illicit substances is highly prevalent. Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment. Many depressive symptoms may resolve with treatment of the substance use disorder. Independent mood disorders can be treated with behavioral therapy and standard pharmacological therapy. Some mood disorder medications are also effective for substance use disorders. Some substances that have historically been used recreationally are being studied as possible treatments for mood disorders.",

Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

The effectiveness of these treatments has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials and is superior to electroconvulsive therapy and dynamic or cognitive psychotherapies for this disorder. Potent serotonin uptake inhibiting drugs, from the class of heterocyclic antidepressants, are the most effective antiobsessional medications currently available. Although these drugs usually do not induce complete remission, they can reduce obsessive compulsive symptoms by 30% to 42%. Behavior therapy combines exposure and response prevention, which the patient first learns with the therapist and then practices independently. With behavior therapy, patients confront the triggers for their anxiety and then delay, diminish, or discontinue their rituals. Reduction in symptoms with behavior therapy averages 50% or greater. Behavior therapy is usually not effective in patients who are substantially depressed, are delusional, fail to comply, or undermine therapy with covert rituals or avoidance techniques. The rare patient with very severe obsessive compulsive disorder who does not respond to behavior or drug therapy may be a candidate for psychosurgery. Modern psychosurgical procedures are quite safe and can improve symptoms in the majority of otherwise unresponsive patients.",

      "abstract": "The effects of LSD are characterized by a number of disturbances of perception and experience, which can be observed in the fields of visual, spatial and temporal perception and of affectivity. We also see disturbances of experience, which can otherwise be observed only in psychoses, for example reduction or change of cognitive functions, but also depersonalization and euphoria. In atypical courses of intoxication (\"horror-trips\") anxiety and excitement are predominant. Atypical courses of intoxication may be interrupted by \"talk down\" and additional application of tranquilizers. In a certain number of LSD-users in our clinic we saw psychoses. We classify them into flash-backs, exogenic (toxic) psychoses and so-called \"endoform psychoses\". The latter implies three possible constellations: accidental coincidence of LSD-use and psychosis; pre-existing psychosis with symptomatic use of LSD as an attempt of self-treatment; finally the onset of a psychosis may be triggered by the use of the halluzinogen. From the symptomatological cross-section they cannot reliably be distinguished from real schizophrenia. An independent nosological unit \"LSD-psychosis\" does not seem to exist.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, we examine some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative-hypnotic compounds, including orexin (hypocretin) receptor antagonists and melatonin receptor agonists (Figure 43–1 ). Sedative drugs moderate excitement, decrease activity, and induce calmness, whereas hypnotic drugs produce drowsiness and facilitate the onset and maintenance of a state that resembles normal sleep in its electroencephalographic characteristics. Although these agents are central nervous system (CNS) depressants, they usually produce therapeutic effects at dosages much lower than those that cause coma and generalized depression of the CNS. History of sedative-hypnotic development. Some sedative-hypnotic drugs retain other therapeutic uses as muscle relaxants (especially benzodiazepines), antiepileptics, or preanesthetic medications. Although benzodiazepines are used widely as antianxiety drugs, it is not known whether their effect on anxiety is truly distinct from their effect on sleepiness. Sedative-hypnotics are also important drugs for neuroscientists. These substances modulate basic behaviors such as arousal and response to stress. As our understanding of the molecular structure of the γ -aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A ) receptor has increased, the mechanisms of these drugs' cellular activity have become clearer. In 2000, it was learned that human narcolepsy with cataplexy was associated with deficiency of orexin (or hypocretin), a newly discovered neuropeptide (Nishino et al. 2000). Although replacement therapies for orexin-deficient narcolepsy using synthetic, small-molecule orexin receptor agonists are not yet available, a dual orexin receptor antagonist has been developed and was approved for the treatment of insomnia in 2014. Further understanding of the sedative-hypnotics' modes of action could thus help to elucidate the neurochemical and neurophysiological processes that control sleep and sleep-related physiology and behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a clinical paroxysmal disorder of recurring seizures, excluding alcohol or drug withdrawal seizures or such recurring exogenous events as repeated insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Epilepsy has a profound impact on each individual diagnosed with this disease. Seizures have been and are thought to arise as a result of abnormalities in (a) neural circuits, (b) excitation/inhibition balance, (c) potassium, and (d) genetic abnormalities. Therapy for epilepsy is either medical, entailing the use of a variety of antiepileptic drugs, or surgical. An urgent approach to seizure control is indicated when status epilepticus occurs. When all standard therapy fails, general anesthesia can be used to control status epilepticus. Surgery is an option in the treatment of epilepsy and requires extensive preoperative evaluation. The primary concerns for the neuroanesthesiologist anesthetizing the patient with epilepsy are the capacity of anesthetics to modulate or potentiate seizure activity and the interaction of anesthetic drugs with antiepileptic drugs. Proconvulsant and anticonvulsant properties have been reported for nearly every anesthetic. If seizure spikes are to be evoked during seizure surgery, then light anesthesia with a proconvulsant anesthetic is used. Conscious analgesia can be used for awake seizure surgery. However, if electrocorticography is not planned, then a general anticonvulsant anesthetic maintenance regimen is used. The latter technique also may be useful in patients whose anesthetic management is complicated by an incidental history of epilepsy.",

Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae.

Early identification of fall risk is likely to result in earlier implementation of intervention and to minimise development of secondary problems such as reduced confidence and activity levels. A comprehensive falls risk factor assessment should be performed for older people who present for medical attention after a fall, those who had more than one fall in the preceding year or those who have abnormalities of gait or balance. Falls are as a result of extrinsic risk factors, intrinsic risk factor or a combination of both. Syncope is defined as a transient, self limited loss of consciousness usually leading to a fall. Syncope and falls are often considered two separate entities with different aetiologies. Disorders affecting balance in the elderly are cerebral, cerebellar, spinal cord disorders; dementia; arrhythmias; postural hypotension; cerebrovascular disease; musculoskeletal/orthopaedic disorders; intervertebral disc disorders; psychological factors; visual impairment. Effective interventions include: (1) Health promotion and falls prevention. (2) Single interventions. (3) Medication review. (4) Exercise. (5) Home modifications. (6) To improve safety in the home. (7) To improve safety outside the home. Effective preventive strategies require better understanding of the causes of and risk factors for falling among elderly.",

Symptoms may be produced by dysfunction of the central nervous system, medication, and/or the psychosocial problems associated with Parkinson's disease. Treatment therefore should be based on the cause of the symptoms seen. In some cases, the reduction or change of antiparkinsonian drugs, or both, may be effective. Treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including motor fluctuations, may reduce the risk of panic attacks being evoked in the 'off' period.

      "abstract": "A drug that subdues exhilaration and produces a calming effect in the subject without necessarily inducing sleep is referred to as sedative. The main system for action of these drugs is the Central Nervous System (CNS). Sedatives are slow working drugs with a levelled dose response curve. They act by modifying nerve responses in CNS to the brain which slows down brain activity thus relaxing the body. Gamma-amino-Butyric acid (GABA) is neurotransmitter which is responsible for retarding the brain functioning and sedatives increase the activity of GABA to produce more effect on the brain activity. Mostly sedatives are used to treat sleep disorders, pain or as anaesthetics. Opioids are sedatives used to treat pain, but long-term usage of these drugs leads to dependency and addiction which may be a challenge to treat. People experience withdrawal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, anxiety, insomnia and/or irritability along with seizures and loss of consciousness in some extreme cases. BXCL501 is a formulation of Dexmedetomidine used to treat agitation and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The drug is designed in such a manner that it reduces agitation but does not produce excessive sedation. The RELEASE clinical trial of “bioxcel therapeutics” lead to the use of this drug to treat or retard opioid withdrawal symptoms and agitations. This article is aimed at reviewing and summarising existing data concerning the synthesis, chemical taxonomy, properties, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile, side effects, interactions, toxicology of dexmedetomidine.",

It is a new concept that has been the focus of recent basic and therapeutic work, and is defined as “SE that continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the onset of anesthesia, including those cases in which SE recurs on the reduction or withdrawl of anesthesia.” It is encountered typically, but not exclusively, in two quite distinctive clinical situations: (1) in patients with severe acute brain injury, and (2) in patients with no history of epilepsy in whom status epilepticus develops out of the blue with no overt cause. There are a variety of treatments used, almost entirely based on open observational studies or case reports. Therapy includes anesthesia, antiepileptic drug therapy, hypothermia and ICU therapy, other medical, immunological, and physical therapies. In this review, the range of possible therapies is outlined and an approach to therapy is discussed.",

Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident).

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by affective and cognitive symptoms that impair overall functioning and cause psychological discomfort. Due to the use of medical services, these entail high societal costs. Objective: Our goal was to provide a thorough overview of this topic while evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacological therapies in OCD and clinical recommendations. Methods: We looked for papers on the use of drugs to treat OCD in the pubmed database, with an emphasis on clinical guidelines, the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, off-label drugs, and pharmacogenomics. Results: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) work best when taken for a lengthy period of time. A SSRI combination with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or the similarly orientated exposure and response prevention (ERP) can produce better outcomes. Treatment options for refractory OCD include switching to a different SSRI or clomipramine or supplementing with an atypical antipsychotic. Further research is necessary because there is conflicting information about the use of antidepressants intravenously or in addition to antipsychotics. Treatment customization and pharmacogenomics may lessen treatment resistance. Conclusions: When compared to each treatment separately or to other treatments, SSRI/clomipramine combined with CBT/ERP produces the best results. For refractory OCD, new approaches are required. In the upcoming years, pharmacogenomics may play a more significant role.",

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional.

      "title": "Diagnostic guidelines for bipolar depression: a probabilistic approach",
      "abstract": "Objectives: There are currently no accepted diagnostic criteria for bipolar depression for either research or clinical purposes. This paper aimed to develop recommendations for diagnostic criteria for bipolar I depression. Methods: Studies on the clinical characteristics of bipolar and unipolar depression were reviewed. To identify relevant papers, literature searches using PubMed and Medline were undertaken. Results: There are no pathognomonic characteristics of bipolar I depression compared to unipolar depressive disorder. There are, however, replicated findings of clinical characteristics that are more common in both bipolar I depression and unipolar depressive disorder, respectively, or which are observed in unipolar‐depressed patients who ‘convert’ (i.e., who later develop hypo/manic symptoms) to bipolar disorder over time. The following features are more common in bipolar I depression (or in unipolar ‘converters’ to bipolar disorder): ‘atypical’ depressive features such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis; psychomotor retardation; psychotic features, and/or pathological guilt; and lability of mood. Furthermore, bipolar‐depressed patients are more likely to have an earlier age of onset of their first depressive episode, to have more prior episodes of depression, to have shorter depressive episodes, and to have a family history of bipolar disorder. The following features are more common in unipolar depressive disorder: initial insomnia/reduced sleep; appetite, and/or weight loss; normal or increased activity levels; somatic complaints; later age of onset of first depressive episode; prolonged episodes; and no family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Rather than proposing a categorical diagnostic distinction between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, we would recommend a ‘probabilistic’ (or likelihood) approach. While there is no ‘point of rarity’ between the two presentations, there is, rather, a differential likelihood of experiencing the above symptoms and signs of depression. A table outlining draft proposed operationalized criteria for such an approach is provided. The specific details of such a probabilistic approach need to be further explored. For example, to be useful, any diagnostic innovation should inform treatment choices.",

Excessive sleepiness is associated with impairments in cognitive and motor tasks and has a negative impact on social and occupational functioning. Further, sleepiness and fatigue strongly predict accidents. Conversely, problems with sleeplessness (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, and early morning wakefulness) are also common symptoms in patients with depression. Recognition and treatment of sleep disturbance are important aspects of managing depression. Pharmacologic intervention and behavior modification are viable treatment strategies.",

As a consequence there is a sharp inhibition of conditioned and, in part, of unconditioned reflexes. Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction. This confirms the presence of cortical inhibition in an arbitrarily induced condition of age or fatigue. If the subject regards himself as being of a younger age or in a more vigorous situation than usual, this will induce a certain increase in the reflexes.",

      "title": "Padma 28 bei Restless-Legs-Syndrom: Fallberichte wecken Hoffnungen auf Wirksamkeit",
      "abstract": "Beim sogenannten Restless-Legs-Syndrom (RLS) handelt es sich um eine neurologische, sensomotorische Störung, welche sich unter anderem durch Symptome wie Gefühlsstörungen und Bewegungsdrang in den Extremitäten äussert. Meist sind die Beine stärker betroffen als die Arme, und es kann neben den Empfindungsstörungen auch zu unwillkürlichen Bewegungen der betroffenen Körperpartien kommen. Folgende vier Symptome müssen für eine klinische Diagnose des RLS vorhanden sein: - Missempfindungen mit Bewegungsdrang;- motorische Unruhe;- verstärktes Auftreten der Beschwerden in Ruhephase und sofortige Verbesserung bei Bewegung;- gehäuftes Auftreten der Symptome gegen Abend bzw. in der Nacht.Man unterscheidet zwischen einer idiopathischen und einer symptomatischen Form des RLS. Die symptomatische Form tritt gehäuft bei verschiedenen Erkrankungen wie Eisenmangel, Diabetes mellitus, Polyneuro- pathie, rheumatoide Arthritis und chronisch venöse Insuffizienz sowie auch in der Schwangerschaft auf. Weiter können Medikamente wie Dopaminantagonisten und Antidepressiva ein RLS auslösen. Die idiopathische Form wird zu 30-92% familiär vererbt, wobei ein autosomal-dominanter Erbgang angenommen wird [1].Das RLS ist eine der häufigsten neurologischen Krankheiten. Seine Prävalenz beträgt in Westeuropa und in den USA etwa 7%. Die Ausprägung der Symptome erstreckt sich über einen weiten Bereich von «kaum bemerkbar» bis «schlafraubend». Da die Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität durch stärker ausgeprägte Symptome erheblich ist (Schlafmangel, Müdigkeit, Konzentrationsschwierigkeiten), suchen viele Betroffene Rat bei medizinischen Fachpersonen.Das therapeutische Spektrum zur Behandlung des RLS umfasst neben der Behandlung der zugrunde liegenden Krankheit das Absetzen möglicher «triggernder» Medikamente, den Verzicht auf Genussdrogen am Abend (Koffein, Nikotin, Alkohol), das Lösen kognitiver Aufgaben vor dem Schlafengehen sowie physiotherapeutische Übungen. Klassische pharmakotherapeutische Massnahmen bei RLS beinhalten Levodopa, Dopaminagonisten, Antiepileptika, Antiparkinsonika und Opiate - allerdings alle mit entsprechend hohem Nebenwirkungspotenzial. Viele Patienten sind trotz des hohen Leidensdrucks nicht gewillt, sich einer solchen Therapie zu unterziehen. Die Nachfrage und der Wunsch nach alternativen Behandlungsoptionen sind deshalb gross.Padma 28 ist ein pflanzliches Arzneimittel, das in der Schweiz nach den Prinzipien der Tibetischen Medizin hergestellt wird und aus 22 Komponenten besteht. Es wird in der Schweiz von der Zusatzversicherung erstattet, das identische Präparat Padmed Circosan von der Grundversicherung.Dieses tibetische Vielstoffgemisch wird bei Parästhesien wie Kribbeln, Ameisenlaufen, Schwere- und Spannungsgefühl in den Beinen und Armen, Einschlafen von Händen und Füssen und Wadenkrämpfen eingesetzt. Diese Symptome können sowohl durch arterielle Durchblutungsstörungen als auch durch eine gestörte venöse Mikrozirkulation im Gewebe verursacht werden. Die von der Swissmedic zugelassenen Indikationen sind: Durchblutungsstörungen wie Kribbeln, Einschlafen von Händen und Füssen, Schwere- und Spannungsgefühl von Beinen und Armen, Wadenkrämpfe.Es gibt Fallberichte, die darauf schliessen lassen, dass Padma 28 bei Erkrankungen wirksam ist, die ein symptomatisches RLS begünstigen oder auslösen können. Da die jeweiligen Erkrankungen in dieser Zeitschrift schon ausführlich vorgestellt wurden, sollen diese im Folgenden nur nochmals kurz erwähnt werden.In einem Fallbericht aus einer Schweizer Allgemeinpraxis [2] wurden 2 Fälle vorgestellt, bei denen Padma 28 bei Parästhesien Linderung schaffen konnte. In einem der Fälle litt ein 68-jähriger Diabetes-Patient (Typ 1) zusätzlich auch an PAVK (periphere arterielle Verschlusskrankheit) Fontaine-Stadium IIb. Er wurde mit Insulin und zusätzlich mit Azetylsalizylsäure 100 mg/Tag behandelt. Aufgrund von Gefühlsstörungen in den Füssen und Schmerzen in den Beinen erhielt der Patient zusätzlich 3 × 2 Tabletten (die galenische Form von Padma 28 und Padmed Circosan wurde inzwischen von Tabletten auf Kapseln gewechselt)/Tag Padma 28. Nach 6 Wochen waren die Beschwerden von mittelstarker auf schwache Intensität zurückgegangen. Nach weiteren 3,5 Monaten war der Patient beschwerdefrei. Deshalb wurde die Dosierung auf 3 × 1 Tablette/Tag reduziert. In den nächsten 8 Monaten reichte diese Erhaltungsdosis aus; die Beschwerden traten nie wieder auf. Die Dosierung wurde präventiv weitergeführt.In einem weiteren Fall litt ein 57-jähriger Diabetes-Patient (Typ 2) (Metformin 1000 mg/Tag sowie Pioglitazon 30 mg/Tag) unter mittelstarken Parästhesien in den Füssen und Dysästhesien in den Händen. Auch dieser Patient erhielt 3 × 2 Tabletten/Tag Padma 28. Dank einer deutlichen Besserung der Beschwerden wurde nach 6 Wochen die Dosis auf 2 × 1 Tablette/Tag reduziert. Nach weiteren 6 Wochen war der Patient beschwerdefrei. Die Erhaltungsdosis wurde weitergeführt.Auch dieser Fallbericht stammt aus einer Schweizer Allgemeinpraxis [3]. Hier handelte es sich um eine 71-jährige Patientin, die wegen mittelstarker Ödeme im rechten Fussknöchel sowie einem subjektiven Kältegefühl in den Füssen in die Behandlung ging. Sie wünschte zur Behandlung des Ödems ein natürliches Produkt und erhielt deshalb 3 × 2 Tabletten/Tag Padma 28. Das Kältegefühl in den Füssen verschwand innerhalb einiger Tage, und schon innerhalb von weniger als 2 Wochen verbesserte sich das Ödem von mittelstark auf schwach. In den nächsten 4 Monaten nahm die Patientin das Präparat nur noch unregelmässig ein. Prompt traten die Beschwerden wieder in mittelstarker Intensität auf. Eine erneute, konsequente Einnahme von 3 × 2 Tabletten brachte die Ödeme innerhalb von 2 Wochen zum Verschwinden. Die Einnahme wurde präventiv weitergeführt; die Ödeme traten nicht mehr auf.Dieser Fallbericht stammt aus einer Allgemeinpraxis in Näfels [4]. Hier handelte es sich um einen 68-jährigen Patienten mit einer diagnostizierten Polyneuropathie (PNP). Die damit verbundenen Beschwerden bestanden schon seit etwa 30 Jahren und äusserten sich in Form von Gefühllosigkeit der Füsse bis zur Mitte der Unterschenkel, Gehschmerzen in den Unterschenkeln, Kältegefühl in den Füssen sowie einer leichten Obstipation. Der Patient klagte auch über seit 20 Jahren bestehende Einschlafstörungen. Auch dieser Patient äusserte den Wunsch nach einer Alternative zur klassischen Medizin. Deshalb wurde ihm Padma 28 in einer Dosierung von 3 × 2 Kapseln/Tag verschrieben. Aufgrund einer deutlichen Verbesserung der Symptome wurde nach 17 Behandlungswochen auf eine Erhaltungsdosis von 2 × 2 Kapseln/Tag reduziert. Die anfänglich stark ausgeprägte Gefühllosigkeit der Füsse bis zur Mitte der Unterschenkel wurde vom Patienten nach 11 Behandlungswochen noch als mittelstark und nach 21 Wochen nur noch als schwach beschrieben. Das Kältegefühl in den Füssen nahm kontinuierlich ab und war nach 21 Wochen verschwunden. Auch die Gehschmerzen in den Unterschenkeln nahmen kontinuierlich ab und waren nach 21 Wochen nur noch schwach ausgeprägt. Auch die Obstipation war nach 21 Wochen nicht mehr vorhanden. Die Einschlafprobleme waren zu diesem Zeitpunkt nur noch schwach.Die 4 vorgestellten Fallberichte geben Hinweise auf eine Wirksamkeit des tibetischen Vielstoffgemischs Padma 28 bei Diabetes-bedingten Parästhesien, bei venösen Beinbeschwerden sowie bei Polyneuropathie. Die Einnahme von Padma 28 zeigte jeweils eine ausgeprägte Abnahme der Beschwerden. Deshalb würde es sich lohnen, weitere Abklärungen durchzuführen, um die Wirksamkeit bei diesen Indikationen zu bestätigen. Weiterhin könnte sich hieraus eine mögliche Wirksamkeit von Padma 28 beim RLS ergeben, da dieses häufig im Zusammenhang mit den in diesen Fallberichten beschriebenen Beschwerden auftritt. Wegen der sehr guten Verträglichkeit von Padma 28 und dem hohen Nebenwirkungspotenzial der klassischen Medikamente zur Behandlung des RLS könnte sich Padma 28 zur wirkungsvollen Alternative in der Behandlung des RLS anbieten.",

      "title": "“Sleep-wake state discrepancy”: toward a common understanding and standardized nomenclature",
      "abstract": "People with insomnia reporting poorer sleep compared to estimates obtained from objective assessments is common across both research and clinical settings. Typically, individuals report less sleep and more wakefulness across a given sleep opportunity compared to that captured via objective methods (e.g. polysomnography) [1–3]. Many different terms have been used to describe this phenomenon since the 1970s [4], including but not limited to the following: sleep misperception [5], sleep-state misperception [6], sleep-state discrepancy [7], subjective-objective sleep discrepancy [3], sleep misestimation [8], and paradoxical- [9] and pseudo-insomnia [4]. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not yet well understood [2] and require future research to inform developments in the diagnosis and treatment (or management) of the disorder. The aim of this letter is to facilitate such work by highlighting recent findings and proposing a new nomenclature to become standard practice for describing this phenomenon. Insomnia is regarded as a “subjective” disorder, for which individuals’ perceptions of sleep and daytime functioning form the basis of its assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. However, objective measurements of sleep may also hold an important role. Clinicians have anecdotally reported that discussing the discrepancy between perceived and objectively measured sleep can be therapeutic. Preliminary findings [10] support this anecdotal evidence, suggesting that personalized feedback about the discrepancy between self-report (sleep diary) and objectively measured (actigraphy) sleep reduced the discrepancy on subsequent nights in a group of 40 individuals with insomnia when compared to those who received no feedback [10]. However, there is limited knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon and the implications for the diagnosis and management of insomnia.",

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

      "abstract": "Human development is a process that continues throughout an individuals life. Any change of structure of function, not only of a progressive type, is a developmental change. Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

      "abstract": "Any change in the social or physical environment that threatens the needs or interests of a mammal, induces a state of tension ('stress') in the animal. Driven by this tension, the animal changes its behaviour. At the same time, alterations occur in bodily functions. All organs and regulatory systems (central and peripheral nervous systems, endocrine and immune systems) participate in these behaviour-physiological response and are affected in their activities. The character of the reactions (e.g. fight, flight, passivity) is mainly determined by the animals appraisal of the environmental change and of the possible impact of its response. Aim of the reactions is neutralising the threat and gaining control over the environment (adaptation). When this is achieved, the tension recedes. In case the response is unsuccessful, the state of tension persists ('chronic stress'). Prolonged exposure of brain and/or bodily functions to stress can result in pathological states.",

Udowodniono, że dysfunkcje seksualne występują u osób chorujących na SM często. Dysfunkcje te występują częściej niż w przypadku pacjentów cierpiących na inne przewlekłe choroby – 70% pacjentów ze stwardnieniem rozsianym dotkniętych jest problemami w sferze seksualnej. Patofizjologia tych zaburzeń jest wieloczynnikowa. Jednym z czynników są uszkodzenia w centralnym układzie nerwowym, innym współistniejące zaburzenia niezwiązane bezpośrednio z obszarami demielizacyjnymi, takie jak: zmęczenie, spastyczność, osłabienie siły mięśni czy skutki uboczne wdrożonej w procesie leczenia farmakoterapii. Należy podkreślić, że część dysfunkcji seksualnych u osób z SM ma podłoże psychologiczne i społeczne. Celem artykułu jest określenie medycznych i społecznych aspektów powstawania zaburzeń seksualnych u osób ze stwardnieniem rozsianym oraz zobrazowanie wpływu dysfunkcji seksualnych na funkcjonowanie jednostki w obrębie społeczeństwa.",

      "abstract": "Results of the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) are frequently abnormal in depression but not always. We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

      "abstract": "Common psychiatric problems in cancer patients include depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and delirium. Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration. He is the youngest of 3 sibs emanating from nonconsanguenious monogamous family with no genetic load of neuropsychiatric disorders. Unremarkable developmental trajectories. Distinguished scholastic achievement. No history of smoking or illicit drug use. No medical comorbidities. Had a history of MVA, 10 months ago, incurred severe TBI, admitt ed to ICU, discharged on prophylactic Valproate 1000 mg/d for posttraumatic seizures. He was faring well following this accident, as reported by parents, apart from occasional complaints of low-grade headaches and giddiness. Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment. He was seen by a private psychiatrist, a diagnosis of psychotic depression was entertained, and fluoxetine (Prozac",

      "abstract": "The following practical issues in psychopharmacotherapy of patients with mental retardation (MR) or other developmental disability (DD) are discussed, with some theoretical speculations: Persons with MR/DD have high rates of psychiatric disorders/symptoms, many of which are drug-responsive and not satisfactorily treated with other modalities alone. However, diagnosis is often complicated by concurrent multiple disorders (both psychiatric and medical/surgical), masking or distortion of symptoms, and communication impairments. Comorbidity and associated treatments should be considered in medication choice. Compared to psychiatric patients of normal IQ, patients with MR may be more sensitive to side effects and toxicity as well as responsive to lower doses, possibly related to less neuronal substrate, qualitative brain differences, or developmental stage. Unexpected or disappointing drug responses may also be related to such statistical quirks as \"end-of-curve\" phenomena. Ripples, ratcheting, and other ecobehavioral considerations influence treatment outcome and drug management. Target symptoms and expected drug benefits should be defined in consultation with caregivers as well as, when possible, the patient. Because drug responses of patients with MR are especially unpredictable, unreliable, sensitive to dose, and fraught with side effects, each medication trial might ideally be approached as a single-subject experiment on a compassionate protocol: quantify the baseline with ratings, behavior counts or other objective measures; start low and titrate slowly; monitor progress with repeated objective measures.",

      "title": "Reactive Psychoses Revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination. Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

Patients were incorrectly diagnosed as epilepsy, conversion (pseudo seizure), or hypochondriasis.In the present series, there were eight men and four women with age ranging from 13 to 72 years. All patients had been taking both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs for at least one year. Strong involuntary movement disorders, torticollis, scoliosis, body pain, difficulty in swallowing, and aphonia were observed Most patients were thin and anemic. They responded well to diazepam, anticholinergic drug, clonazepam lithium, and antidepressant while antipsychotic drugs were discontinued in most cases. Calcium salt and iron supplement appeared to be useful.Physicians should be aware of these abnormal movement disorders induced by AP drugs to detect early and provide prompt treatment.

ME describes a syndrome where there is general muscle pain associated with evidence of a disturbed nervous system [2]. ME, commonly referred to as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), or post-viral fatigue syndrome is a condition in which mental and physical fatigue predominate. It is characterized by gross abnormal muscle fatigue which occurs after relatively mild activity. Other symptoms regularly complained of include sleep disturbance, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, feeling depressed, bouts of low grade fever (not exceeding 38-6°C), increased sensitivity to light, back and neck pain, sore throat, irritable bowel and bladder [3]. The symptoms of ME typically become apparent following a viral infection [4], although other trigger factors have been noted. Vaccinations against cholera, tetanus, typhoid and influenza have been associated with the onset of ME [5]. It has also been observed that any psychological disturbances in ME occur secondary to, or share a common pathophysiology with an immunological dysfunction [6]. In many cases there appears to be no apparent triggering factor [7].",

It leads to various disorders influencing the quality of gait: at the lower limb varus equinus foot deformity, toe-claw and/or hip adduction with adductors spasticity. At the upper limb, flexion deformity of the wrist and the hand makes grasp and grip ineffective and spasticity of the Pectoralis Major muscle is considered as a main cause of sympathetic dystrophy. Neurolysis with alcohol injection in the nerve trunk or at the motor point destroys the gamma fibers and reduces spasticity, without impairing motor command. The effects on spasticity, motricity, and deformity of 33 chemical neurolysis with alcohol are analysed with a six months follow-up (27 hemiplegic patients, 28 to 62 years old, mean = 54.5). The authors have used 60% alcohol concentration. Sciatic nerve injection significantly reduces triceps spasticity (7/11), improves the range motion of the ankle, and allows the patient to take off the ankle device. Those fair results are still present at the fourth month after injection. Similar results are reported after injection of the obturator nerve for hip adduction deformity (2/3), median nerve injection for wrist and hand deformity (6/6). Pectoralis Major injection in the motor point is effective for 10 of the 13 cases, preventing sympathetic reflex dystrophy or contributing to its dramatic improvement.",

La cirugia funcional ha adquirido gran relevancia en el tratamiento de las complicaciones motoras de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) avanzada, y menos conocida es la influencia de la estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP) en los sintomas no motores (SNM). Objetivo. Revisar la bibliografia sobre ECP y SNM en la EP. Desarrollo. Los resultados de la cirugia funcional sobre los SNM de la EP son variables en los distintos estudios. Algunos sintomas mejoran -trastornos del sueno, dolor o disconfort, trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos- y empeoran o aparecen otros -fluencia verbal, apatia, aumento de peso-. En estudios aislados se encuentra mejoria en memoria de trabajo, secuenciacion visuomotora y razonamiento, algunos trastornos digestivos, genitourinarios, de termorregulacion y olfativos, y empeoran la memoria verbal (recuerdo diferido) y visuoespacial, la velocidad psicomotora y la funcion ejecutiva, mientras que otros sintomas -hipotension ortostatica- no muestran cambios. Existen otros factores, ademas de la estimulacion, que pueden modificar los SNM, como la vulnerabilidad preoperatoria individual, la disminucion de medicacion dopaminergica tras la cirugia, la propia EP y los cambios psicosociales. En pacientes con perfiles determinados pueden existir riesgos especificos -mayor riesgo de alteracion cognitiva en pacientes de mas de 69 anos o con alteracion cognitiva precirugia; mayor riesgo de depresion, mania o suicidio en pacientes con patologia psiquiatrica previa-.

      "title": "The inflammation hypothesis and mental illness",
      "abstract": "Contemporary neuroscience and psychiatry are currently experiencing a rapid evolution. The foundations of these relatively new sciences are still largely theoretical and speculative. There are many competing hypotheses regarding the etiology and pathogenesis of mental illness. Unlike most somatic pathology, there is not a single laboratory test or objective disease marker for any psychiatric disorders. One of the dominant etiological paradigms in psychiatry involves the functional levels of neurotransmitters. Even this assumption is mootable, untestable, and widely disputed.\r\nSeveral psychiatric disorders - Depression, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, Traumatic Brian Injury, Autism, Parkinson’s disease, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder are associated with a dysregulation of immune responses and measurably increased inflammatory markers.\r\nThere is an empirical correlation of an over-activated immune system with the development of psychiatric symptomatology. By experimentally inducing systemic inflammation, cognition and behavior are adversely affected. By experimentally suppressing inflammation, sensorium and mood can be dramatically improved.\r\nAnti-inflammatory agents such as NSAIDS (COX-2 inhibitors), low-dose Aspirin (COX-1 inhibitors), and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (Omega-3 Fatty Acids) have demonstrated effectiveness – sometimes surpassing first-line psychotropic medications – in reducing psychiatric symptomatology.\r\nIt has also been demonstrated that some antidepressant and antipsychotic medications exert measurable immune modulation and anti-inflammatory effects. This may in part explain some of their therapeutic actions further challenging the theoretical foundation of the neurotransmitter hypothesis.\r\nThe notion of neuroinflammation is opening the door to a groundbreaking scientific endeavor. There is even a debate among these trailblazing scientists about what to call this promising and emerging field; Immunopsychiatry or Psychoneuroimmunology.\r\nA conspicuous question is then raised as to whether inflammation causes mental impairment or does psychiatric pathology induce inflammation? Is inflammation the chicken or the egg? This is an exciting new frontier in psychiatry. It will offer promising novel targets for treatment and new avenues for therapeutic innovation.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The incubus phenomenon is a paroxysmal sleep-related disorder in which patients experience sleep paralysis and compound hallucinations. The symptoms of this phenomenon contain: sensed presence, fear, visual and auditory hallucinations, unusual body experiences such as out-of-body experience and feelings of floating/paralysis, experiencing a pressure on the thorax, difficulties breathing and a feeling of pain(1). This phenomenon appears to be universal, but has different cultural explanations(2). Objectives We present a case of possible incubus phenomenon to raise awareness about this specific condition. Methods A literature search in English was performed using PubMed with the following mesh term: ‘incubus phenomenon’. Results We present a 29-year old man, known with an intellectual disability (IQ=74), psychotic disorder and a cannabis use disorder. After neurological examination, he was diagnosed with narcolepsy and cataplexy. Over the past weeks there had been an increase of hallucinations that appear before, during or after sleep. The patient’s thoughts included sexual approaches by caregivers, difficulties in breathing and a moving sensation while laying down in bed and experiencing pressure on the thorax assuming a woman was sitting on his chest. Literature search shows a lifetime prevalence of 0.11 % in general population versus 0.41 % in psychiatric patients(2.) Conclusions Literature review shows only a few cases describing the incubus phenomenon. The prevalence is four times higher in patients with a psychiatric history(2) and should not be confused with psychotic disorder. Recognizing is important for proper treatment, as reoccurring attacks can be treated with anxiolytics, antidepressants, anticholinergics or anti-epileptics, and sleep hygiene methods(1.)

For this reason some physicians prefer the term of addiction to drug. Unlike the benign addiction, by conditioning, drugs addiction initiates very fast (after 1 or 2 intakes), had a big resistance at treatment and show the phenomena of sever disturbance in withdrawal. In this paper we refer mainly at this kind of dependency. Nervous disturbances that are produced during drugs and even alcohol intakes refer to psychical affective and cognitive processes.

The patient's behavior in these situations may be motivated by the psychological meanings, interpersonal communications, or social consequences of taking pills. The physician may be able to identify these psychosocial factors by learning about the patient's prior experiences with medications, by eliciting his views of physicians and medical care, and by understanding the consequences of becoming a patient.

Some symptoms of the disease, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, can be ameliorated with drug treatment, whereas other symptoms, such as social withdrawal and cognitive decline, remain uncontrolled. It is possible that these latter symptoms that are often termed ''negative symptoms'' are the result of anatomical and neurochemical abnormalities, whereas those symptoms of the disease such as auditory hallucinations that are termed ''positive symptoms'' may be a result of only neurochemical disorders. The drugs used to treat schizophrenia are designated neuroleptics. The term neuroleptic was chosen to emphasize the similarity of pharmacological profiles of drugs with entirely different chemical structures. Especially prominent features of the effects of neuroleptics include the following: a state of affective indifference; a decrease in locomotor activity; a decrease in excitation, agitation, and aggressiveness; and an antipsychotic action in patients with acute as well as chronic psychoses.",

Contraindications include uncontrolled seizures, dangerous anxiety, active cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, active psychosis, drug abuse, irresponsible criminal behavior, dangerously underweight, and uncontrolled headaches. Recommend use is 6 days per week 51 weeks per year to reduce tolerance. Some patients find additional benefit from donepezil, rivastigmine, and regulated caffeine use. Approach options: “aggressive,” involving treatment with stimulants primarily based on history; “moderate,” involving treatment with stimulants only in patients with attention performance impairments documented with neuropsychological evaluation; and “conservative,” not including stimulants unless there is a well-documented history of preinjury attention deficit disorder.",

Current and lifetime histories of depression in the adolescents were highly comorbid with several other mental disorders. The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder. Depression in both groups was more likely to occur after the other disorder rather than to precede it. Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression. Comorbidity in the adolescents was associated with greater frequency of suicidal behavior and treatment seeking. The findings suggest that early-onset depression is associated with a greater degree of comorbidity and may represent a more serious form of the disorder.",

Ecstasy has now reached the illegal drug market in Denmark via the US, Great Britain and Sweden. The drug is related to a certain youth culture from which it is estimated that many drug abusers have been recruited. The desired effects of ecstasy, namely enhanced openness, awareness and empathy, have previously been used in various therapeutic connections. In later years the drug has led to abuse which, in connection with certain cultural behaviour patterns (for example in discotheques), can cause dangerous psychiatric as well as somatic effects. The undesirable psychiatric effects range from fear through depression to actual psychoses, and the somatic effects vary from symptoms of increased sympathetic activity to malignant hyperthermia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and lethal hepatotoxicity. The last mentioned symptoms occur in connection with prolonged physical activities such as exhausting dancing sessions.

That it cannot be employed, as in the preanalytic period, as a means of interpretation and psychological exploration is clear from what is said by Anna Freud. After discussion in deep analysis during wakefulness, and in the light of the psychodynamic concepts of psychoanalysis, of the what interpretat to be given to the dynamic process of the symptom, we can exactly repeat this interpretation in a hypnotic trance. It is vulnerable, like hypnoid states (emotion, fear, anxiety, anger, fatigue, surmenage, transition from wakefulness to sleep) in which a psychic pathological process may easily start due to \"difference of level, blank in the consiousness\" and absent \"abreaction\". This vulnerability and increased tendency to accept has been encountered in hypnoid states as in artificially induced trances, and gives a much more rapid entrée to the patient's integration process. The interpretation of the dynamics of his symptom, once accepted, becomes an active force, and produces effects that would, in any event, have been produced if the integration process had occurred normally, without the acceleration provided by hypnotism, leading to resolution of the symptom. What is involved, therefore, is acceleration of the psychoanalytic process.",

The examination of the offender's mental state may help to recognise undiagnosed neuro-psychiatric conditions. The case of a man, suspected to have violently murdered his spouse is reported. During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness. The alcoholic state does not limit culpability, while epileptic disturbance of consciousness may exempt the offender.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "title": "Reconsidering the term ‘disinhibition’ in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors‐induced apathy syndrome",
      "abstract": "Apathy occurs in individuals treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).1, 2 This adverse effect of SSRI was first reported as ‘frontal lobe syndrome’ or simply ‘apathy’ by Hoehn-Saric et al. in 1990.3, 4 Barnhart et al.5 later described this phenomenon as ‘SSRI-induced apathy syndrome.’ Most of the subsequent studies on emotional or motivational problems induced by SSRI have investigated only apathy as a symptom, but Hoehn-Saric et al. described disinhibition in addition to apathy in their first case reports.3 Others have also reported the same phenomenon.6, 7 We report the case of a patient who walked around in a garden in the snow against her better judgment after her panic disorder was improved by an SSRI2 Our patient did not show symptoms sufficient for the diagnosis of hyperthymia or dissociative disorder. ‘Disinhibition’ is usually understood as ‘doing what is against one's sense of ethics,’ whereas disinhibition induced by SSRI is rather closer to ‘doing what one is unwilling to do or what one knows is unnecessary.’ Clinicians should be aware of disinhibition induced by SSRI, because disinhibition and/or apathy could be misdiagnosed as treatment-resistant depression,2 mixed status, or conversion to a manic phase. These phenomena can be distinguished from mixed or manic states based on the presence of agitation8 or a total mood change, or on sleep and daily activities. Reduced activation was reported after the administration of SSRI in both the ventral striatum and medial/orbitofrontal cortex related to the reward system and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex associated with aversive stimuli.1 Odd disinhibition behavior induced by SSRI may be explained by these mechanisms. We recommend that the term ‘disinhibition’ should be replaced with another term to precisely describe SSRI-induced adverse behavior. Such a term (e.g., ‘involuntary unwilling behavior induced by an SSRI’) that excludes behaviors that are in violation of one's sense of ethics would be more appropriate.

      "title": "Where do we go in occupational neuroepidemiology?",
      "abstract": "Early knowledge about the neurotoxic effects of occupational exposures appeared through clinical observations. The observed effects were more or less acute and concerned exposure to metals such as lead and mercury or solvents like carbon disulfide and trichloroethylene. With time, however, also more chronic and clinically less obvious effects of neurotoxic agents have been assessed through modern examination methods and systematic studies of larger groups. Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

      "abstract": "The construct of major depressive disorder makes no etiological assumptions about populations with diverse symptom clusters. “Depressed mood” and “loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities” are core features of a major depressive episode, though a strong case can be made to pay increasing attention to symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and neurocognitive and sexual dysfunction in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment outcome. Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

It does not (a) have any anticonvulsant activity, (b) interact with the benzodiazepines or alcohol, or (c) have a demonstrated abuse potential. 1 In many ways, it is ideally suited for the treatment of mild to moderate anxiety. However, since buspirone does not interact with the benzodiazepines, it does not protect against benzodiazepine withdrawal. Such withdrawal can present as either a minor or a major abstinence syndrome, with the former being more frequent and preceding the latter. The minor abstinence syndrome consists of anxiety, restlessness, anorexia, dysphoria, and insomnia. In the major abstinence syndrome, withdrawal phenomena include grand mal seizures, delirium, and psychosis. 2,3 Withdrawal phenomena are documented for benzodiazepines with a long (eg, diazepam) or short (eg, lorazepam) half-life.

      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between suicidality and substance abuse has long been recognized, although studies have only fairly recently begun to identify factors that may help clarify how alcohol or other drug abuse increases the susceptibility to suicidal behavior in vulnerable populations. In particular, alcohol and other psychoactive substance misuse has been linked with mood destabilization and the induction of manic or depressive episodes in affectively ill individuals, while also demarcating groups with heightened tendencies toward impulsivity, aggression, and sensitivity to interpersonal loss. Serotonergic mechanisms have been implicated in each of these clinical settings, along with possible dysregulation of other neurotransmitter systems. Psychosocial aspects of alcohol or drug abuse relevant to suicide may involve a heightened sensitivity to interpersonal loss, poor coping skills in response to adverse life events, and affective dysregulation induced by circadian and psychosocial stresses. Consequently, self-destructive behaviors with relatively little premeditation may arise during periods of increased stress, intoxication, depression, or other psychopathology. Early detection of substance abuse followed by appropriate pharmacologic and/or psychotherapeutic interventions may greatly help to minimize the formation of complex comorbid psychiatric conditions and reduce the potential for suicidal acts among high-risk populations.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified).

ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "title": "Human Pharmacology of MDMA",
      "abstract": "MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) is a widely misused psychostimulant drug abused among large segments of the young population. Pharmacologically it displays effects related to amphetamine-type drugs and a set of distinctive effects (closeness to others, facilitation to interpersonal relationship, and empathy) that have been named by some authors “entactogen” properties. MDMA is a potent releaser and/or reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). These actions result from the interaction of MDMA with the membrane transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake and vesicular storage systems. The most frequent effects after MDMA/ecstasy administration are euphoria, well-being, happiness, stimulation, increased energy, extroversion, feeling close to others, increased empathy, increased sociability, enhanced mood, mild perceptual disturbances, changed perception of colors and sounds, somatic symptoms related to its cardiovascular and autonomic effects (blood pressure and heart rate increase, mydriasis), and moderate derealization but not hallucinations. Acute toxic effects are related to its pharmacologic actions. The serotonin syndrome (increased muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, and hyperthermia), among others, is characteristic of acute toxicity episodes. MDMA metabolism is rather complex and includes 2 main metabolic pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The fact that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 partially regulates the O-demethylenation pathway prompted some expectations that subjects displaying the poor metabolizer phenotype may be at higher risk of acute toxicity episodes. In this metabolic pathway a mechanism-based inhibition of the enzyme operates because the formation of an enzyme–metabolite complex that renders all subjects, independently of genotype, phenotypically poor metabolizers after the administration of 2 consecutive doses. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics on acute toxicity is limited. One of the interesting features of MDMA metabolism is its potential involvement in the development of mid- to long-term neurotoxic effects as a result of progressive neurodegeneration of the serotonergic neurotransmission system.",

First, agitation can interfere with the patient's care and second, there is evidence demonstrating that the prognosis of agitated (and delirious) patients is worse than that of non-agitated (non-delirious) patients. These conditions are often under-diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Consequently, a systematic evaluation of this problem in ICU patients should be conducted.

      "title": "The “Good Enough” Mood Stabilizer: A Review of the Clinical Evidence",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing family of medications is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. These medications fall into two broad categories according to likely mechanisms of action. Within the categories, specific drugs may vary in their efficacy for different phases of the disorder. The first category, including lithium, anticonvulsants, and some novel treatments, appears to have mechanisms related to intracellular second messengers. These medications have more pronounced antimanic than antidepressant effects, except for lamotrigine, which has antidepressant effects without precipitating mania. The second group of mood stabilizers is the atypical antipsychotics, which act through dopamine and other monoamines. Olanzapine and in all likelihood other drugs in the class possess marked, acute antimanic properties and possible antidepressant properties, but require further study before they can be used as routine options in long-term care. It is clear that the advent of multiple mood stabilizer candidates has not yet led to a single ideal therapy for bipolar disorder, but rather to options that can be flexibly tailored to the lifetime needs of individual patients, in sequences or combinations, and perhaps in conjunction with other classes of psychotropics.",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses. Detailed neurological evaluation needs to be undertaken in such cases. Timely recognition of PBA is essential for an effective treatment.

      "abstract": "Neural disorders refer to conditions of the nervous system due to infection or degeneration of the neurons leading to either neurodegenerative disorder or neuropsychiatric disorder. Some such disorders of the nervous system include Parkinsons’s disease, depression, amnesia, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, cerebrovascular impairment, epilepsy, seizure disorders, etc. In conventional medical system, some medicines belonging to the class of psychodelic drugs, sedatives, neurotransmitters, neuro-stimulants, etc. are in extensive use. Unfortunately, most of these drugs either delay the progression of the neural disorder or leave the patient with prominent adverse side effects. Several potent bioactive compounds with neuroprotective potential have been reported from medicinal plants and some of them have been found to be highly effective. Belonging from natural sources, mostly, the plant derived compounds exhibit minimum or no cytotoxicity at a prescribed standardised dose against a particular health ailment. Many such phytocompounds from plant sources with potent neuroprotective activities have been in use in Ayurvedacharya, Unani, and Chinese medicine for ages. The compounds if isolated chemically, modified to make more potent neuroprotective derivatives and utilised to make highly effective neuroprotective pharmaceutical formulations with minimum side effects, may open new revolutionary doorways in neuropharmacology. In this review, it has been briefly discussed about the neuroprotective compounds isolated from certain indigenous plants of West Bengal, India, and their mechanism of action.",

      "abstract": "About 20% of adults experience excessive daytime sleepiness or severe fatigue. Causes include somatic conditions, psychiatric disorders, and medication or drug use. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If sleepiness persists despite optimal treatment of the underlying condition, exclusion of other causes, and behavioral interventions, wakefulness-promoting agents may be considered. However, no established pharmacological strategy exists for symptomatic treatment. Modafinil and stimulants like methylphenidate may offer some benefit based on experiences with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia. Studies in specific patient groups (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, cancer-related fatigue) show variable results. The use of wakefulness-promoting agents is discouraged for addressing unexplained fatigue, as seen in the context of chronic fatigue syndrome.",

      "abstract": "After an experimental application of electroshock a prior stressful event was disregarded—Stripped of its associative connections—in the manner consistent with the defensive operation known as isolation. Neutral events that occurred both before and after the stressful event were clearly remembered after the electroshock. Clinical studies to be reported elsewhere (I) indicate that the arousal or enhancing of active defensive operations appears to be the most decisive effect of convulsive electroshock treatment. It is probably for that reason that ECT is helpful in those conditions in which defensive operations are at a low ebb, ineffective or exhausted, such as in depression and other severely regressive psychotic states, but that it is ineffective—in fact disturbing—in those conditions in which defensive operations are already too disturbingly alerted, constituting an obstacle to treatment and recovery, such as in anxiety states.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

      "abstract": "1) Reserpine is a remarkable and useful drug. It has a definite place in psychiatry for the alleviation of selected symptoms. It is not in any sense a psychic “specific”. 2) The physiologic effects of this drug are relatively constant. The principal ones are a fall in blood pressure, a relative bradycardia, and in adequate dosage, a slowing of the patient's spontaneous activity; feelings of weakness, tiredness and of being held down. 3) There are other effects, which are predominantly psychological and it is felt that they have nothing to do with the physiological effects per se. They are the result of the way in which the physiological action fits into the patient's way of handling and expressing his conflict (i.e. defenses). When a patient does badly it is due to the way in which the physiological effects psychologically threaten the patient. A patient does well or badly depending on this, and we have seen enhanced anxiety as well as psychoses produced by both reserpine and chlorpromazine (8). 4) Because of the above, psychotherapeutic efforts are of the greatest importance, and when used, usually overshadow the effects of the drug. We feel that no patient is treated in a vacuum. Milieu and relationship is what counts most. The other factors, though important, are adjuvants. 5) A level of 10 to 40 mg./day will control most motor over-activity. Anxiety and most panics can be handled at between 2 and 10 mg./day. The average daily dose was 7 mg./day. The average length of treatment was 26 days. 6) Side effects are frequent, but are rapidly reversible. There were no serious or irreversible toxic effects. The drug is remarkably safe. 7) Reserpine is of about the same usefulness as chlorpromazine in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is quicker acting. Reserpine is safer. When the G.I. tract is irritated or the site of symptoms, chlorpromazine is preferable. Cardiac or cardiovascular symptomatology might indicate a preference for reserpine, especially when bradycardia is desirable. Neither is a “specific” curative agent. Both are useful for the symptomatic relief of selected symptoms. Both have their contra indications. Neither is an effective substitute for intimate human contact with the patient. Both should be used along with psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder with qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal social interaction and patterns of communication. Patients with autism, or an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are sometimes difficult to manage from an anesthetic perspective because they may become scared, or at least very inquisitive of what is, and what will be happening to them. In the pre-operative holding they may become agitated, self-destructive, or resistant because it is a change in their normal routine; sometimes leading them to refuse to cooperate during induction. If such behaviors are observed, or expected based on the preoperative evaluation and/or the conversation with the parent or caregiver, a premedication should be considered. Depending on the severity of the displayed or expected behavior, the premedication options at our institution often range from none, midazolam, or a combination of benzodiazepines and ketamine. However, there are cases where ketamine cannot be used (e.g., prior adverse event, allergy), thus alternative options are needed. We present a case report of a 22 yearold patient with severe autism who responded to a premedication combination of oral clonidine and midazolam, given due to a previous adverse reaction to ketamine.",

      "title": "When Duzitol Does Not Do It All",
      "abstract": "The range of effects that are part of a clinically adequate state of general anesthesia are hypnosis (loss of appropriate response to verbal command), amnesia (lack of recall of intraoperative events), analgesia or pain relief along with blunting of the adrenergic response to noxious stimuli, and suppression of movement in response to noxious stimuli. These effects are produced by distinct pharmacologic actions even when they are produced by one drug.1 In their 1992 editorial, Shafer and Stanski provided the pharmacokinetic profile of a fictitious IV-administered anesthetic, Duzitol (a combination amnestic, hypnotic, analgesic, and muscle relaxant).2 Unfortunately, such an IV anesthetic has yet to be introduced into clinical practice. The IV-administered anesthetic agents that are available are drugs that have an affinity for specific receptors and, unless given in very high doses, produce very specific effects. Therefore, to produce a clinically adequate state of general anesthesia with the drugs in the contemporary anesthetic armamentarium, drugs from at least 2 different classes must be used in combination. When drugs are used in combination, their effect can be infra-additive (i.e., antagonistic), additive, or supra-additive (i.e., synergistic). Antagonistic interactions generally involve deliberate reversal of the effects on one drug by another (e.g., flumazenil reversal of the effects of a benzodiazepine).3 Additive interactions are typically observed when drugs exert their effect through interaction with the same receptors or receptor subtypes (e.g., minimum alveolar concentration [MAC] additivity of inhalation anesthetics), whereas synergistic interactions are observed when drugs produce their effects by different or slightly different mechanisms.3,4 One method to graphically present drug interactions is by using an isobologram.5 The 2 axes of the isobologram ideally represent the effect-site concentrations of the 2 drugs of interest (Fig. 1). The line on the graph represents the drug concentration pairs that elicit the same response. Infra-additive interactions are represented by a line that curves away from the graph origin (zero–zero concentration point); adding a second drug at a low concentration requires a higher concentration of the first drug to elicit the same response. If the drug interaction is additive, the x- and y-axis intercepts are connected by a negative-sloping straight line. Finally, with a synergistic relationship, the interaction line is curved toward the graph origin, which is equivalent to a left shift of the first drug's concentration–response curve. Synergy, then, is the addition of a low concentration of a second drug to a greatly reduced concentration of the first drug to attain the same response. In their analysis of the literature on anesthetic drug interactions, Hendrickx et al. concluded that opioids interact synergistically with not only volatile anesthetics but also IV-administered hypnotics.4 Unfortunately, drug interactions can be a double-edged sword; synergy is often observed for both the desirable aspects of anesthesia or sedation and undesirable side effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular depression; little is known or has been studied about these latter interactions.3,4Figure 1: This graph is an isobolographic cartoon of the various categories of drug interactions. Drug interactions can be antagonistic (infra-additive), additive, or synergistic (supra-additive).4 , 5 Antagonistic and synergistic interactions can have various amounts of bowing away from or toward the line of additivity, respectively. The curves can also be symmetric (as shown for the antagonistic interaction) or can be skewed toward one or the other axes (as shown for the synergistic interaction). The concentrations depicted on the graph axes are arbitrary values and not representative of any particular drugs.Volatile anesthetics can produce a clinically adequate state of general anesthesia with a single drug. When the volatile anesthetic is classified as an immobilizer, the MAC of that drug can be determined as the minimum brain-equilibrated alveolar concentration that prevents half of those tested from moving in response to a noxious stimulus (i.e., the median concentration). Although opioids can significantly reduce the MAC of a volatile anesthetic, there is no dose of an opiate alone that will prevent movement; there is always a low concentration of the volatile anesthetic required to achieve MAC (synergy by definition).4 In the same way, high concentrations of a sedative/hypnotic can be used to provide anesthesia as long as ventilation of the subject is assured. However, the recovery from such an anesthetic can be quite prolonged. High concentrations of any drug may also increase the incidence of unwanted side effects. In an effort to minimize side effects and hasten anesthetic recovery, a balanced anesthetic is preferred. A balanced anesthetic takes advantage of the primary effect of each drug by matching each component of the anesthetic to the effect of a single drug. To this end, the sedative/hypnotic assures lack of recall, muscle relaxants prevent movement, and the opioids blunt the adrenergic response and reflex movement to noxious stimuli while providing pain relief on emergence. Moderate to deep sedation as a part of monitored anesthesia care (the other MAC) has different goals and almost never includes a volatile anesthetic. The patient is expected to maintain adequate spontaneous ventilation and oxygenation; assisted ventilation or the insertion of an airway device becomes a general anesthetic by definition. It is particularly important for the patient to maintain spontaneous ventilation or respond to prompts to breathe when the patient is undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and the anesthesia caregiver must “share” the airway. Typically during sedation, the nociceptive input is at least partially blocked by local infiltration or topical application of a local anesthetic. When the noxious stimuli are not completely blocked, an analgesic or higher doses of sedative/hypnotics are required. By making use of the interaction of sedatives and analgesics, the dose of each can be lowered; hence, a more rapid recovery can be realized. If the 2 drugs being used have a synergistic effect, large dose reductions of each can be accomplished. However, synergy of adverse effects, including respiratory depression, can also occur. In this issue of Anesthesia & Analgesia, LaPierre et al. have looked at the combined effect of a sedative/hypnotic and an opioid in blunting the responses to esophageal instrumentation, which is likened to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.6 The aim of their study was to “explore selected effects of combinations of remifentanil–propofol effect-site concentrations that lead to a loss of response to esophageal instrumentation (blunt-end bougie insertion; positive outcome), along with a loss of responsiveness, and/or the onset of intolerable ventilatory depression (negative outcomes).” A secondary aim was to create response surface models (3-dimensional [D] isobolographic interactions) for each of the 3 observed effects. The authors hypothesized that they could determine selected effect-site concentrations of the combination of remifentanil and propofol that would permit esophageal instrumentation in a high percentage of these volunteers while avoiding loss of responsiveness or intolerable ventilatory depression. They also hypothesized that the interaction of propofol and remifentanil would be synergistic. When administering an anesthetic, we strive to attain our goal in more than half or, preferably, >99% of our patients. Indeed, in the article by LaPierre et al. the authors include isobolograms for the 5% and 95% responses in addition to that for 50% (their Fig. 2, A and C, and Fig. 3).6 But what if you are interested in other response percentages? The Utah anesthesia research group frequently and effectively uses response surfaces to illustrate their interactive data. A response surface is a 3-D rendition of the more common (2-D) isobologram, which illustrates the response of a group of subjects to various concentration combinations of 2 drugs.7 A response surface is a 3-axis plot of the isobolographic response with the third (vertical) axis representing the percentage of responders (or nonresponders) as a continuous function (LaPierre et al.'s Fig. 2, B and D). The surface is particularly useful in illustrating the transition zone separating responders from nonresponders. Individual isobolograms can be illustrated on the surface as a subset of the continuous relationship.Figure 2: This is a graph of the effect-site concentration history of propofol resulting from a rapid infusion of 0.8 mg · kg−1 given over 1 minute immediately followed by a constant rate infusion of 83 μg · kg−1 · min−1 until 120 minutes. The effect-site concentration is within 10% of the 2.0 μg · mL−1 target for the first 60 minutes, at which time a new lower-rate infusion should be initiated.Figure 3: This is a graph of the effect-site concentration history of remifentanil resulting from a rapid infusion of 0.15 mg · kg−1 given over 1 minute immediately followed by a constant rate infusion of 0.03 μg · kg−1 · min−1 until 120 minutes. The effect-site concentration rises to a value of 0.9 ng · mL−1 at 75 minutes. A larger initial infusion would, obviously, produce this concentration sooner with the risk of higher initial concentrations.Comparing the results of LaPierre et al.6 to those of Lallo et al.8 reveals a very interesting similarity. In the Lallo et al. study the authors compared the predicted effect-site concentrations of propofol to those of remifentanil when each drug was administered alone, as the only “sedative” for nasotracheal intubation. They found that the propofol group lacked recall and would breathe spontaneously, but were more likely to display an uncooperative response to noxious stimulation. The remifentanil group could typically recall events, were cooperative, and would appropriately respond to reminders to breathe. Similar results can be gleaned from Figure 1A in the study by LaPierre et al.6 If the preferential endpoint is loss of response to esophageal instrumentation and no intolerable ventilatory depression, there are 2 groups of concentration pairs that could be acceptable. One group, along the propofol axis, is the combination of effect-site concentrations of propofol of 1.5 to 2.7 μg · mL−1 and remifentanil up to 0.8 ng · mL−1. The other group, along the remifentanil axis, has effect-site concentrations of remifentanil of 3 to 4 ng · mL−1 and propofol up to 0.6 μg · mL−1. The authors state that there appears to be a region of low remifentanil (0 to 1.5 ng · mL−1) and high propofol (4 to 6 μg · mL−1) concentrations in which there is a high probability (>80% to 95%) of loss of response to esophageal instrumentation and a moderate probability (40% to 70%) of intolerable ventilatory depression. There is no “sweet spot” (LaPierre et al.'s Fig. 3) for which there is greater than a 95% probability of loss of response to esophageal instrumentation and less than a 5% probability of intolerable ventilatory depression.6 However, the authors did find that 2 to 3 μg · mL−1 of propofol and 0.8 ng · mL−1 of remifentanil blocked the response to esophageal instrumentation and avoided intolerable ventilatory depression in a majority of volunteers. Clinical application of the predicted effective concentrations derived in these studies is particularly problematic for anesthesia practitioners in the United States who do not, as yet, have access to target-controlled infusions other than in a research setting. We are more accustomed to thinking in terms of infusion rates than in terms of plasma or effect-site concentrations. Therefore, to provide a more familiar reference, we have used the Schnider (propofol)9,10 and Minto (remifentanil)11 models to simulate a bolus-infusion regimen that will attain effect-site concentrations near the optimum concentration pairs as determined by LaPierre et al.6 For propofol, 0.8 mg · kg−1 (56 mg/70 kg) infused over 1 minute followed by a 83 μg · kg−1 · min−1 infusion will attain and maintain an effect-site concentration within 10% of 2 μg · mL−1 for the first 60 minutes of the infusion (Fig. 2). For remifentanil, 0.15 μg · kg−1 infused over 1 minute (10 μg/70 kg) followed by a 0.03 μg · kg−1 · min−1 infusion will attain and maintain an effect-site concentration of about 0.9 ng · mL−1 (Fig. 3). A larger-bolus dose would obviously obtain this concentration sooner with the risk of higher initial concentrations. These simulations were performed using SAAM II software and the aforementioned model parameters (SAAM Institute, Seattle, WA). We can conclude that the adverse synergy of adding remifentanil to propofol, resulting in the negative endpoints of loss of responsiveness, intolerable respiratory depression, or both, outweighed the positive synergy gained by adding remifentanil. It would seem that the use of either propofol alone (the patient will breath spontaneously despite loss of response to verbal stimuli) or remifentanil alone (the patient is able to respond to prompts to breathe), as demonstrated by Lallo et al.,8 may be the preferred method of sedation. The message must be heard loud and clear by all proceduralists. If they are performing a procedure on a mild to moderately sedated patient, or even with deep sedation (with the patient maintaining a patent airway and spontaneous ventilation), a significant percentage of those patients will respond, in an uncooperative manner, to a noxious stimulus. If opiate is added to alleviate this unwelcome response, the patient will possibly stop breathing and require ventilatory support, precluding continuation of an upper endoscopy or airway intervention.

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Benzodiazepines and Z‐drugs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

This study describes another interesting psychiatric symptom, which seems to be characteristic of DLB, in many patients who visited the author's psychogeriatrics department for neurocognitive disorders or psychogeriatric diseases. Methods The clinical courses of seven representative cases of DLB, each of which included episodes of this interesting psychiatric symptom, are described to clarify the commonalities they shared. Results After examining the characteristic symptoms of these cases, a novel term was proposed for a new concept in psychiatric phenomenology, the “Yume‐Utsutsu” (dreamy or half‐asleep) phenomenon. “Yume‐Utsutsu” is a Japanese word that means a mental state in which dreams are indistinguishable from reality. This phenomenon is different from visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, rapid eye sleep movement behavior disorder, delirium, and epilepsy‐related automatism. Conclusions The “Yume‐Utsutsu” (dreamy or half‐asleep) phenomenon proposed as a novel psychiatric concept in this article is useful for diagnosing and clarifying the psychopathology of DLB.",

Other sensory stimuli did not elicit an attack. Clinical evidence of diffuse brain damage from birth was present in all of them. The attacks developed before 2 years of age and were as frequent as 50 or more each day. Electroencephalographic recording during seizures revealed a similar pattern in all patients. Tactile stimulation evoked long-latency (60 to 125 msec), brief bursts of widespread, bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical EEG discharges. They occurred before, synchronous with, or after the myoclonus. A defective descending inhibitory system may lead to development of both the EEG discharges and the myoclonus in response to a peripheral sensory stimulus.",

      "title": "Mutism as a Complication of Total Intravenous Anesthesia by Propofol",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: We read with interest the recent case report by Kati et al. (1). The authors describe a 56-year-old woman who developed somnolence and mutism for 11 days postoperatively, after total intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl, propofol, and vecuronium for a femur fracture fixation. The authors concluded that this neurologic complication may be attributed to an unknown effect of propofol. We think another possible explanation for the symptoms described in the case may have been a presentation of central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS). The signs and symptoms of CAS are similar to those described with atropine overdose and consist of somnolence, confusion, amnesia, agitation, hallucinations, ataxia, delirium, stupor, or coma in addition to tachycardia, dry mouth, dry skin, visual disturbances, and dysarthria (2). CAS occurs when drugs occupy central cholinergic sites leading to insufficient release of acetylcholine (2). CAS has been linked to many drugs including atropine sulfate, hyoscine, promethazine, benzodiazepines, opioids, halothane, and ketamine (3). CAS has also been described after propofol anesthesia (4) and even after nitrous oxide withdrawal (5). In animal studies, it has been shown that fentanyl has strong affinity for muscarinic receptors, whereas morphine and alfentanil do not exhibit any affinity for muscarinic receptors (6). Since the patient in the presented case received propofol, fentanyl, and atropine during anesthesia, we feel that CAS is a distinct possibility. CAS symptoms may last from hours to days (7). The diagnosis of CAS is made by exclusion, after ruling out other causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia and by a positive therapeutic response to physostigmine, a centrally active anticholinesterase agent. The incidence of CAS during the postoperative period has been reported to be up to 9.4% after general anesthesia and 3.3% after regional anesthesia with sedation (2). In a prospective study of 962 patients by Link et al. (8), 18 patients developed the syndrome, all of whom responded promptly to physostigmine administration. Katsanoulas et al. (9), reported two cases in which a delay in diagnosis of CAS resulted in unanticipated intensive care admission and acute lung injury. We suggest that the diagnosis of CAS should be considered in all patients, including the one in the case report by Kati et al. (1), who demonstrate abnormal postanesthetic awakening. Additionally, physostigmine should be readily available (10) and administered perioperatively in situations where the possibility of this diagnosis is considered.

And consequently, altered behavior or cognition level, which clinically can be manifested as negative postoperative behavioral change, postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, may occur following general anesthesia.

      "title": "Third Generation Antipsychotic Drugs: Partial Agonism or Receptor Functional Selectivity?",
      "abstract": "Functional selectivity is the term that describes drugs that cause markedly different signaling through a single receptor (e.g., full agonist at one pathway and antagonist at a second). It has been widely recognized recently that this phenomenon impacts the understanding of mechanism of action of some drugs, and has relevance to drug discovery. One of the clinical areas where this mechanism has particular importance is in the treatment of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs have been grouped according to both pattern of clinical action and mechanism of action. The original antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been called typical or first generation. They cause both antipsychotic actions and many side effects (extrapyramidal and endocrine) that are ascribed to their high affinity dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism. Drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and others were then developed that avoided the neurological side effects (atypical or second generation antipsychotics). These compounds are divided mechanistically into those that are high affinity D(2) and 5-HT(2A) antagonists, and those that also bind with modest affinity to D(2), 5-HT(2A), and many other neuroreceptors. There is one approved third generation drug, aripiprazole, whose actions have been ascribed alternately to either D(2) partial agonism or D(2) functional selectivity. Although partial agonism has been the more widely accepted mechanism, the available data are inconsistent with this mechanism. Conversely, the D(2) functional selectivity hypothesis can accommodate all current data for aripiprazole, and also impacts on discovery compounds that are not pure D(2) antagonists.",

In the treatment of neuropathic pain, the first-line drugs are antiepileptic drugs (gabapentin and pregabalin, or carbamazepine) and antidepressants (amitriptyline and duloxetine). In the case of insufficient efficacy of the above drugs, the addition of acetaminophen or opioid (for example tramadol) may be considered. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain [1, 2].",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction in a patient being treated with antidepressant medications may be due to the underlying depression, a coexisting medical illness, disruption of interpersonal relationships, or it may be a side effect of the medication. Almost all antidepressants are associated with sexual side effects that go above and beyond any symptoms that can be explained by the disease process itself. The incidence of such sexual side effects can be as high as 92% for some antidepressants. Some of the newer antidepressants currently on the market seem to have a lower incidence of sexual dysfunction as a side effect. In view of the fairly common occurrence of these unwanted effects, and their potential contribution to noncompliance, careful selection of antidepressant medications is necessary. A variety of treatment options is available, including decreasing the dosage of medication to the lowest-effective level, adjunctive medications (such as cyproheptadine, bethanechol, yohimbine, and amantadine, as well as other antidepressants) to counteract the adverse sexual effects, or switching to another antidepressant. The treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction requires a creative approach on the part of the treating psychiatrist, and must be individualized to the patient.",

In unplanned complex suicides the mode of performance is changed after the first method chosen failed or was working too slow or proved to be too painful. In planned complex suicides typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g. ingestion of medicines, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, fall from a height) are combined. But also unusual combinations have been described such as the simultaneous firing of two guns, self-immolation in combination with other suicide methods or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides self-inflicted injuries by sharp force, especially cuts of the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases the suicide switches from cuts to stabs (mostly to the heart region). Other methods often used after the first phase of suicide are hanging and jump from a height. In the literature the use of up to 5 suicidal methods applied one after the other have been described.",

After administration of 12 pills during 2 days, he started hearing music and songs not heard by others. One day later, when the number of ingested pills increased to 18, he decided to discontinue amiodarone and consulted a cardiologist; no signs of physical, ECG or laboratory deterioration were observed. MHs disappeared next day and returned only as a single episode when he tried to restart amiodarone at a dose of 1 pill daily 2 weeks later. Finally, following complete removal of the medication, he experienced no MHs whatsoever.

The book covers a wide range of topics by leading researchers, including: • Superior performance after brain lesions or sensory loss • Return to normal function after a second brain lesion in neurological conditions • Paradoxical phenomena associated with human development • Examples where having one disease appears to prevent the occurrence of another disease • Situations where drugs with adverse effects on brain functioning may have beneficial effects in certain situations A better understanding of these interactions will lead to a better understanding of brain function and to the introduction of new therapeutic strategies. The book will be of interest to those working at the interface of brain and behaviour, including neuropsychologists, neurologists, psychiatrists and neuroscientists.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is a distressing and debilitating condition with a familial tendency; it may be associated with situational (agoraphobic) avoidance. The diagnosis of panic disorder requires recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and at least one of the following characteristics: persistent concern about having an additional attack (anticipatory anxiety); worry about the implications of an attack or its consequences (e.g., a catastrophic medical or mental consequence) and making a significant change in behavior as a consequence of the attacks. A variety of pharmacologic interventions is available, as are non-pharmacologic cognitive or cognitive-behavioral therapies that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of panic disorder. Early detection and thoughtful selection of appropriate first-line interventions can help these patients, who often have been impaired for years, regain their confidence and ability to function in society.",

The nature of the hallucination assists localization, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning. In particular, the presence of persistent visual hallucinations of persons with Parkinson's disease predicts dementia, rapid deterioration, permanent nursing home placement, and death. Hallucinations in persons with Alzheimer's disease are often associated with serious behavioral problems and predict a rapid cognitive decline. Theories of the etiology of hallucinations include (1) stimulation, e.g., neurochemical, electrical, seizure, and ephaptic, and (2) inhibition, e.g., destruction of normally inhibitory functions, resulting in disinhibition as in the Charles Bonnet and phantom limb syndromes. Functional neuroimaging procedures suggest anatomical associations for hallucinations. While hallucinations may be a symptom of medical, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders, they may also occur in a wide range of human experiences.",

Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

An impressive aspect of this phenomenon is that, during the meditation, the intense emotional affect that would ordinarily accompany this ideation, e.g., when obtained by free association, seems to be markedly reduced or almost absent. During meditation, thoughts and ideas may appear that are ordinarily repressed, such as intense hostile-aggressive drives, murderous impulses, and, occasionally, libidinal ideation. Evaluation of electroencephalogram records in patients and subjects using the relaxation techniques reveals remarkable periods of intrahemispheric alpha and theta synchrony at times, even for inexperienced subjects. In a Transcendental Meditation meditator who has been meditating for more than 4 years, there occurs synchronous alpha activity upon closing the eyes, even before starting to meditate on the temporal, central, and occipital cortical areas.",

The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms.

      "title": "Neuronal Mechanisms Mediating the Integration of Respiratory Responses to Hypoxia.",
      "abstract": "The activation of peripheral chemoreceptors by hypoxia or electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve elicited a hypoxic respiratory response consisting of both stimulatory and subsequent or simultaneous inhibitory components (hypoxic respiratory stimulation and depression). Both components have different time domains of responses (time-dependent response), providing an integrated respiratory response to hypoxia. This review has focused on the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological correlations responsible for these responses and their neuropharmacological mechanisms. Hypoxic respiratory depression is characterized by the initial activation of respiration followed by a progressive and gradual decline in ventilation during prolonged and/or severe hypoxic exposure (biphasic response). The responsible mechanisms for the depression are located within the central nervous system and may be dependent upon activity from peripheral chemoreceptor. Two underlying mechanisms contributing to the depression have been advocated. (1) Change in synaptic transmission: Within the neuronal network controlling the hypoxic respiratory response, hypoxia might induce the enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission (modulation), disfacilitation of excitatory neruotransmission or both. (2) Change in the membrane property of respiratory neurons: Hypoxia might suppress the membrane excitability of respiratory neurons composing the hypoxic respiratory response via modulating ion channels, leading to hyperpolarization or depolarization blocking of the neurons. However, the quantitative aspects of Pao2 (degree and duration of hypoxic exposure) to induce these changes and the susceptibility of both mechanisms to the Pao2 level have not yet been clearly elucidated.",

A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics.

Visceral hypersensitivity associated with altered reflex activity seems to be a common pathophysiological mechanism in functional gastrointestinal disorders. Investigation of visceral sensitivity in humans is based on distension tests using barostat, or tensostat more recently. Tensostat may allow better standardization of distending stimuli, regardless of the capacity or compliance of the organ being tested. Other techniques include transmucosal electrical nerve stimulation, and chemical or thermal stimulation. Measurement of the responses to gut stimuli is based on the evaluation of conscious perception or objective responses, such as reflex activity or central processes. Recently, the assessment of the central responses has become available due to a variety of new brain imaging techniques. Several factors are thought to influence the results of visceral sensitivity studies: age, gender, physiological factors (postprandial testing) as well as psychological factors (stress, hypnosis, hypervigilance phenomenon). Technical conditions for performing tests like distension protocols may considerably affect the perception of sensory thresholds. Various mediators and pharmacological agents, in particular those acting on serotonin receptors, affect the sensory function of the gastrointestinal tract, and some of them have therapeutic potential in the treatment of visceral hypersensitivity.",

We argue that these traditional definitions fail to draw a clear line between altered and normal states of consciousness (NSC). We outline a new definition of ASC and argue that the proper way to understand the concept of ASC is to regard it as a representational notion: the alteration that has happened is not an alteration of consciousness (or subjective experience) per se, but an alteration in the informational or representational relationships between consciousness and the world. An altered state of consciousness is defined as a state in which the neurocognitive background mechanisms of consciousness have an increased tendency to produce misrepresentations such as hallucinations, delusions, and memory distortions. Paradigm examples of such generally misrepresentational, temporary, and reversible states are dreaming, psychotic episodes, psychedelic drug experiences, some epileptic seizures, and hypnosis in highly hypnotizable subjects. The representational definition of ASC should be applied in the theoretical and empirical studies of ASCs to unify and clarify the conceptual basis of ASC research.",

      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

Symptoms of grief include physical and psychological changes including body aches, anxiety, and emotional pain.

Furthermore, a variety of factors related to characteristics of the griever, the nature of the loss, and available support may influence grief processes and health outcomes. When grief becomes particularly distressing or prolonged, individuals can experience complicated grief, which is tied to more negative grief outcomes. Individuals with stronger support networks may experience improved health effects during bereavement.",

      "abstract": "Accessible summary • Individuals with cognitive impairment may display a range of challenging behaviours such as agitation, aggression or inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB). • ISB incorporates any verbal or physical action of a sexual nature displayed within an inappropriate social context. • Although ISB is less common than other forms of challenging behaviour, it may still have a range of deleterious effects on the victims health. • Nurses are at risk of being exposed to ISB and this article will provide a useful insight to the nursing profession of this phenomenon. Abstract Persons with progressive cognitive impairment such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease may display an array of challenging behaviours. For instance, levels of agitation and aggression have been reported as high as 33% in home-dwelling individuals and 80% in those residing in institutions. One form of challenging behaviour that may be displayed by this group is inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB), but it is often overshadowed by other behaviours such as aggression. Inappropriate sexual behaviour involves any verbal of physical action of a sexual nature which is displayed in an inappropriate social context. Examples of ISB include: exposure of genitals in public/ward environments, ‘groping’ of nurses and masturbation in public areas. It has been estimated that the prevalence of ISB ranges from 2% to 17% of individuals with progressive cognitive impairment. Although it is less frequent than other challenging behaviours, it still may have significant deleterious effects on the victim's health. This paper is a review of the available literature on the nature, effects and management of ISB in persons with progressive cognitive impairment. Possible avenues for future research are also explored.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a cognitive (appraisal and coping), interactive (person x situation interaction) and multidimensional (three response systems) perspective of anxiety, stress and emotions is presented. According to it, anxiety is conceptualized as a negative or unpleasant emotion characterized by subjective distress, high physiological activation, unadapted motor responses; at the same time, anxiety is linked to individual differences in certain situational areas (specific traits). Anxiety reactions appear due to subject perceives that a certain situation seems threating (situation's appraisal), with no apparent solution due to a lack of resources (coping abilities). For somebody, certain consummatory behaviors such as eating, alcohol consumption, smoking, or drug abuse could relieve distress symptoms or reduce physiological activation producing by anxiety. However, such consumption behaviors could become more and more necessary in order to alleviate anxiety symptoms or avoiding the withdrawal, which is a clinical syndrome including intense anxiety manifestations. The possibility to stop the consumption is interpreted as a threatening situation which provokes more anxiety; the only coping response available is to maintain consumption. Regarding addiction treatments, there are significant interactions between type of treatment x type of patient. Anxiety is on of the variables evaluated in order to design more effective treatments matched with the characteristics of the patient.",

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

      "abstract": "Se trata de una observacion clinica durante un periodo de dos anos de un joven de 21 anos que se presentaba muchas veces en urgencias por una fuerte angustia con importantes trastornos del comportamiento caracterizados por agitaciones psicomotrices, automutilaciones repetidas, amenazas o intentos de homicidio hacia el padre, impulsos frecuentes y a veces conductas antisociales (fugas, estados de peligrosidad). En sus trastornos subyacian muchas veces ideas de persecucion y de referencia. Habia tambien frecuentes intentos de suicidio vinculados con breves periodos depresivos en los que verbalizaba un gran sufrimiento afectivo, que el explicaba esencialmente por dificultades relacionales familiares y por acontecimientos traumaticos (maltrato parental, accidentes). Dos anos despues, el cuadro clinico se agravo con la aparicion de sintomas esquizofrenicos constituidos por un delirio paranoide, alucinaciones con automatismo mental, retraccion social, desorganizacion afectiva y comportamental que se sustituyeron totalmente en sus pasos al acto autoagresivos. Luego se han vuelto mas complejos con la observacion psicoterapica que abre la problematica sexual e identitaria del paciente.La observacion consistio en una escucha atenta durante las entrevistas psicoterapicas regulares que han permitido recorrer la historia evolutiva de esta patologia, al mismo tiempo que su estabilizacion. Nuestro objetivo era despejar una perspectiva clinica y evolutiva que tomara en cuenta la progresion de los sintomas en funcion del tiempo hasta la constitucion de una psicosis propiamente dicha. Limitado por la exploracion neurobiologica (balances, EEG, IRM cerebral) sin resultado aparente, el analisis semiologico de los sintomas del paciente, de sus escritos y de sus simbolos nos ha permitido investigar diferentes fases precoces de la enfermedad, asi como el analisis psicopatologico de sus sintomas.Resultados: Esta experiencia personal nos ha permitido determinar el primer sintoma, conocer el periodo inicial de los trastornos y sus relaciones con los factores de vulnerabilidad (trauma parental y genetico), describir su evolucion segun la edad y reconstituir los sintomas de transicion psicotica. El fin de este articulo es subrayar el papel preventivo de la atencion precoz de los trastornos prepsicoticos. Sin embargo, sigue en pie el interrogante sobre el impacto de la angustia en el desarrollo neuropsiquico del paciente y sobre el origen genetico de la enfermedad. Conclusion: Insistimos en el enfoque preventivo que consiste en detectar los sujetos con riesgos de transicion psicotica y pensar en realizar una psicoterapia adaptada.",

We introduce the ideas of psychotomimetic compensation and psychotomimetic sensitization to explain this paradox. Psychotomimetic compensation refers to a stress or drug induced compensation against stress (see Fig 1) that is facilitated by engagement of neurotransmitter/modulator systems (endocannabinoid, serotonergic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic) that mediate the effects of common psychotomimetic drugs (see Fig 3). Psychotomimetic sensitization occurs after repeated exposure to stress and/or drugs (Fig 3) and is evidenced by the gradual intensification and increase of psychotic-like experiences over time. Theoretical and practical implications of this model are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Treatment nonadherence is a significant public health problem that spans medical and psychiatric populations, adding billions of dollars to healthcare costs [1]. Patients with chronic and severe mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as those with substance use disorders (SUDs) tend to exhibit high rates of nonadherence (e.g., 50% or greater) to their medication and psychosocial treatments [2-7]. Not surprisingly, then, nonadherence rates tend to be highest in SMI patients who also abuse drugs or alcohol compared with noncomorbid patients [8]. Nonadherence in co-occurring SMI and SUDs produces a host of negative consequences, including increased rates of relapse, hospitalization, suicide, and functional impairment [5,9-11]. Abrupt withdrawal from psychotropic medications for SMI can lead to a quick return of symptoms that is not just attributable to the original illness, but also due to potential rebound effects associated with withdrawal from medications [12,13]. Furthermore, premature treatment drop out averages 50% within the first few weeks of SUD treatment [4-6], which prevents early intervention that can alter illness trajectories and provide needed course corrections prior the development of clinical crises. Nonadherence also contributes to the so-called “efficacy-effectiveness gap” [14]. We spend large amounts of money and resources developing efficacious mental health treatments, but these interventions will have little public health impact unless patients view them as acceptable and adhere to them.",

In these cases hypnosis either in formal psychotherapy or embedded into the everyday communication with the physician can effectively complement other already known medical and psychological techniques. Although numerous studies have reported the beneficial physical and mental changes induced by hypnosis, for a long time there were not enough research to affect evidence-based medicine. New studies meeting the most rigorous methodological standards, new reviews and the characteristics of hypnosis shown by neuroimaging techniques support the acceptance of this method. Hypnosis is used and studied with adult and child tumor patients alike mostly in the areas of anxiety, pain, nausea, vomiting, quality of life, mood amelioration, immune system and hot flushes. Most of the assays describe hypnosis as an empirically validated treatment technique that in most cases surpass attention diversion, coping trainings, cognitive behavior and relaxation techniques and other regular treatments.

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

Clinically significant aberrant test performance may be noted after chemical exposure as well as with other diseases of the CNS. In addition, neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression are often manifested as cognitive difficulties that are similar in pattern to the cognitive dysfunction caused by toxic chemicals.

      "title": "0998 Duloxetine as a Possible Effective Treatment of Klein-Levin Syndrome Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Kleine Levin Syndrome (KLS), or recurrent hypersomnia, is a rare sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe hyper-somnolence lasting several days to several weeks. Because the etiology is unknown, treatment is mostly supportive. Some pharmacologic agents have been attempted to treat symptoms during episodes with limited success. Report of case(s) Patient is a 17 year-old with a history attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and generalized anxiety disorder who presented to the clinic due to recurrent episodes of severe hypersomnolence associated with derealization and cognitive dysfunction during all episodes, anxiety of being alone, and other symptoms in some episodes such as altered taste affecting appetite, and binge eating. The patient was diagnosed with KLS and tracked episodes which lasted 11-12 days (average) with recurrence every 10-17 days. Labs, 72 hour EEG, MRI and MRA were largely unremarkable. The family declined trial of Lithium. Pharmacogenetic testing showed significant gene-drug interaction with duloxetine requiring higher drug dosage for effects. After psychiatry started duloxetine, the patient experienced a 7 month period without episodes. Then episodes recurred for unclear reason while on duloxetine but with slightly less duration (6-12 days) and shorter time between episodes. Duloxetine was discontinued due to lack of mood effects. Clarithromycin was trialed next for use during episodes without changes. Episodes were tracked for several months with some predictability. Duloxetine was restarted a second time after several months, and the patient showed mild improvement in event duration down to 8-11 days for a few months. Time between episodes also shortened to 8-10 days. Anxiety was only slightly reduced between and during the episodes, though they still continued to struggle with derealization and ability to focus during episodes that effected school and work functioning. Interestingly, they also started to have more insomnia between episodes while on duloxetine. Conclusion KLS is a rare disorder with limited data on effective treatments. To date, this is the first report of a prolonged brief KLS remission with duloxetine. Norepinephrine and serotonin modulation may limit episode duration. More research is needed to determine whether duloxetine can modulate the effects of KLS. Support (if any) None",

      "title": "Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms may not be helpful to enhance understanding of behavioural addictions",
      "abstract": "The importance attached to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in the conceptualization of addiction reflects the prominence of theories that posit neuroadaptation to the presence of a drug [1], and suggest that drug use persists because of negative reinforcement, i.e. as an effort to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms [2]. Given that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms do not always occur in addiction, they have not been included in the recent general definitions of addiction [3–5]. However, these phenomena are often incorporated into the conceptualization of behavioural addictions. For example, one model [6] postulates that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms are mandatory for any behaviour to be considered addictive. In behavioural addictions, tolerance is usually defined in a way that superficially resembles its counterpart in substance addictions, i.e. dose escalation to achieve the same initial effect. Thus, tolerance is portrayed as an increase in various aspects of the activity (frequency, intensity, duration, time spent, money spent) to achieve the desired effect, satisfaction or excitement. Occasionally, it is described as a need for the latest or more powerful equipment (e.g. mobile phones, computers, software) to produce the desired effect or excitement [7,8]. The diagnostic criteria for internet gaming disorder [9] do not state the purpose of an increase in activity engagement, implying that any such increase denotes tolerance. Nevertheless, increased activity engagement and a need for better equipment in behavioural addictions do not necessarily reflect tolerance [10,11], which underscores the importance of assessing the contextual aspects of these phenomena. Withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions have usually been described as emotional states (irritability, restlessness, anger, moodiness, sadness, guilt, anxiety, feeling tense) that occur when activity engagement is thwarted. In internet gaming disorder, withdrawal symptoms can be easily mistaken for reactions to an externally imposed gaming deprivation or for craving for gaming [12]. There have been no reports of severe physical withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions [13], and a few studies reporting physical withdrawal symptoms in pathological gambling [14,15] had significant methodological shortcomings. Withdrawal states occurring upon abrupt drug cessation comprise both physical and emotional symptoms, with the latter hypothesized to contribute more to the motivation to continue using drugs because of the short-lasting effects of the former [2]. In pathological gambling, however, emotional withdrawal symptoms, as well as tolerance, were not found to play an important role in maintaining this behavioural addiction [16]. ‘Borrowing’ tolerance and withdrawal from substance addictions might have been driven by a need to ‘legitimize’ behavioural addictions. This was unnecessary, because these phenomena and theories suggesting that they are important for addiction have not been able to account fully for either type of addiction [5]. The alternative is to conceptualize behavioural addictions via specific factors that explain more clearly attachment to the particular activity [17] and maintenance of addictive behaviour. In pathological gambling, these factors were identified as the negative feelings associated with gambling losses, shortage of money and the need to be secretive about gambling [16]. The task is to ascertain factors that provide an adequate account for each behavioural addiction. None.",

It is extremely incapacitating, and frequently results in impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced work performance. Currently there is no cure for narcolepsy, so treatment focuses on control of symptoms. (2) Although the sympathomimetic stimulants, such as amphetamines or methylphenidate, are effective in improving excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy, they have the potential for dependence, have sometimes disabling sympathomimetic side-effects and are associated with tolerance. (3) To date, there is clear evidence of the efficacy of modafinil, armodafinil and sodium oxybate in patients with narcolepsy. Modafinil and armodafinil improve excessive daytime sleepiness symptoms and have little abuse potential, but have no effect on cataplexy, so other drugs, such as antidepressants, are required to control cataplexy attacks.

      "title": "Staging in bipolar disorder: from theoretical framework to clinical utility",
      "abstract": "Illness staging is widely utilized in several medical disciplines to help predict course or prognosis, and optimize treatment. Staging models in psychiatry in general, and bipolar disorder in particular, depend on the premise that psychopathology moves along a predictable path: an at-risk or latency stage, a prodrome progressing to a first clinical threshold episode, and one or more recurrences with the potential to revert or progress to late or end-stage manifestations. The utility and validity of a staging model for bipolar disorder depend on its linking to clinical outcome, treatment response and neurobiological measures. These include progressive biochemical, neuroimaging and cognitive changes, and potentially stage-specific differences in response to pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Mechanistically, staging models imply the presence of an active disease process that, if not remediated, can lead to neuroprogression, a more malignant disease course and functional deterioration. Biological elements thought to be operative in bipolar disorder include a genetic diathesis, physical and psychic trauma, epigenetic changes, altered neurogenesis and apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Many available agents, such as lithium, have effects on these targets. Staging models also suggest the utility of stage-specific treatment approaches that may not only target symptom reduction, but also impede illness neuroprogression. These treatment approaches range from prevention for at-risk individuals, to early intervention strategies for prodromal and newly diagnosed individuals, complex combination therapy for rapidly recurrent illness, and palliative-type approaches for those at chronic, late stages of illness. There is hope that prompt initiation of potentially disease modifying therapies may preclude or attenuate the cognitive and structural changes seen in the later stages of bipolar disorder. The aims of this paper are to: a) explore the current level of evidence supporting the descriptive staging of the syndromal pattern of bipolar disorder; b) describe preliminary attempts at validation; c) make recommendations for the direction of further studies; and d) provide a distillation of the potential clinical implications of staging in bipolar disorder within a broader transdiagnostic framework.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mortality and neurological and mental outcome were studied in infants 28 days to 1 year of age with afebrile seizures not due to an acute postnatal injury. Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history.

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During maternal separation, some primate and nonprimate species show a biphasic (active/passive) response. The second stage is characterized by reduced activity, a hunched body posture, and other behaviors. Traditionally, the second stage has been referred to as “despair” and is considered an animal model for human depression. Recent research in psychoneuroimmunology suggests an alternative hypothesis—that behaviors occurring during the second passive phase represent stress‐induced “sickness behaviors.” This perspective more readily accounts for findings in widely divergent species, does not require assumptions regarding the ability to express complex emotional states, is empirically testable, and aligns the separation model with recent hypotheses regarding the nature and ontogeny of depressive illness. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

Are anxiety and depression entirely separate disorders which may co-exist in the same patient? Does anxiety give rise to the depression? Does depression give rise to the anxiety? Are anxiety and depression manifestations of a single underlying disorders, dysphoria? Therapeutic responsivity to specific drugs suggest: relief of anxiety may reveal an underlying depression; anxiety syndromes which fail to respond to anxiolytics may respond to antidepressants; short-term relief of depression may occur at times with anxiolytics. Proposed mechanisms of action of depression and anxiety also involve overlap of the elements and systems involved. The basic sensations of pain, anticipation, depression and euphoria alone or in combination are sufficient to account for the dysphoric feelings and emotions when these sensations are associated with specific mental content. These may be related in turn to biogenic amines, beta-endorphins, diazepam receptors and possibly cocaine receptors.",

      "abstract": "The new DSM-5 has a number of changes to addictions and substance-related disorders. Internet Gaming for instance is a “Condition for Further Study”. This means that it is not an “official” disorder in the DSM, but one on which the American Psychiatric Association request additional research. The DSM diagnostic criteria for addictions to the X-subject generally include: – repetitive use of X, that leads to significant issues with functioning; – preoccupation or obsession with X; – craving/withdrawal symptoms when not dealing with X; – the person has tried to stop or curb X, but has failed to do so; – the person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies; – a person has had continued overuse of X even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person's life; – the person uses X to relieve anxiety related to other issues; – the person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of X. I suggest that some sport fans may: – meet the above mentioned criteria; – be subject to over-identification with “their team performances”, superstitious conditioning and loss of self-consciousness that may lead to a full blown addictive syndrome, along with comorbidity with pathological gambling. This seems particularly true in Italy, for example, as far as the phenomenon of ultra football supporters is concerned. I argue that further research might be needed to explore the psycho-social consequences of obsessive sport addiction and how this may impact on a person's overall functioning.",

Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease.

      "title": "Putative changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission following nicotine induced behavioural sensitisation",
      "abstract": "Behavioural sensitisation is a progressive enhancement of stereotypic or locomotor behaviour following repeated intermittent administration of a psychostimulant or stress. It is a phenomenon thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, addiction, depressive disorders, dyskinesia, and psychosis) although its own mechanism remains contentious. In this thesis a multidisciplinary approach was used to investigate the role of dopamine in behavioural sensitisation. Different in vivo and ex vivo techniques were used to assess and elucidate putative changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission of behaviourally sensitised animals. If so, this improved understanding of behavioural sensitisation could provide a better understanding of the pathophysiologies of neuropsychiatric disorders and provide more insight into why existing pharmacotherapies for these disorders are able to confer only modest benefit. Moreover, this improved understanding can lead to development of new medication and more effective therapies to treat neuropsychiatric disorders and therapies that address the specific problems associated with them.\r\nPreviously, an oversimplified view of neurotransmitter release was used for the development of current available drugs, i.e. stabilising either the attenuated or increased release of neurotransmitters without considering the involvement of synaptic plasticity. Therapies being used with modest effectiveness regulate dopamine transmission levels, suggesting a putative role for dopamine. The present study used chronic intermittent nicotine administration in rodents to induce behavioural sensitisation which was monitored behaviourally by measuring locomotor activity. Further studies were performed ex vivo assessing receptor binding, intracellular cAMP accumulation and electrically stimulated dopamine release. Prior to the pharmacological assessments, a novel LC-MS/MS method to measure (cyclic-) nucleotides was developed and a fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV) technique was established to measure real-time neurotransmitter release. Specific pharmacological tools were used to identify the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in behavioural sensitisation. Finally, the ex vivo findings using tissue from sensitised and non-sensitised animals were compared to those findings obtained in vivo.",

      "abstract": "When it has been decided, as a result of examination and investigation, that a considerable part of the total clinical picture is due to anxiety or other emotionally determined factors, the medical and nursing professions have at their means several alternatives and combinations of treatment to use. As the terms of reference of this book are psychosomatic disease, it is not proposed to go into detail regarding moderate or major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. The very fact that a patient is in hospital is frequently therapeutic in itself as it means that society, relatives and friends have acknowledged the person's right to receive care and help, and that he is 'worthy' for this to take place. Naturally such a formulation is never spelt out but is implicit in the total situation of hospital admission or even out-patient care. In the majority of conditions where a specific event needs to be altered or cured, for example pneumonia, appendicitis, childbirth, there will be in most cases no need for any further considerations towards the patient's mental state other than perhaps a mild sedative at night. When, however, it has been decided that stress or unresolved anxiety is playing a part in the maintenance of the symptoms, then notwithstanding a specific measure such as gastrectomy or administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, those caring for the patient may wish to use other measures, which can be divided into specific and non-specific.",

Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "abstract": "The frequency of some episodic psychic symptoms (dysmnesic, perceptual, and experiential) was determined in a 2,500-subject general population sample. Correlations with some risk factors eventually associated with nervous system dysfunctions (seizure history, head injury, car accident, hospitalization, febrile illness, and birth injury) were calculated. Subjects with one or several risk factors were more likely to report episodic psychic phenomena in daily life. Significant correlations of episodic psychic phenomena with sleep disorders, headache, allergies, and a history of learning disabilities were observed. We propose that some subclinical dysfunctions can be associated with the appearance of episodic psychic phenomena in otherwise normal subjects.",

      "abstract": "The clinical presentation and neurobiology of depression in youth and its appropriate treatment, as well as strategies for improving therapeutic benefit and preventing adverse outcomes, including suicide, are reviewed.Functionally impairing depression occurs in 2-10% of children and adolescents. A diagnosis of depression should be considered when a physically healthy child exhibits depressed mood or anhedonia, multiple somatic complaints, or behavioral changes, such as bullying, aggression, and social withdrawal. Risk factors for depression include childhood trauma, genetic susceptibility, and environmental stressors. Antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy are the most effective treatments for adolescents with depression. Youth are at risk for the same adverse effects as adults but have an increased risk of behavioral activation, or switch, to mania and suicidal thoughts and behaviors early in treatment. Compared with other antidepressants, fluoxetine has the most evidence for safety and efficacy, particularly in adolescents 12 years or older. There is very little evidence for the effectiveness of any antidepressant in children 11 years and younger. Youth receiving antidepressants should be monitored closely for new-onset or worsening suicidality, particularly during the first two weeks after starting medication, and for three months of therapy. Behavioral activation, aggression, worsening depression, anxiety, insomnia, or impulsivity can herald a switch to mania or suicidality.Depression in youth is common and treatable and responds best to multimodal treatment combining patient and family education, cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressant medication. The potential benefits of antidepressants outweigh the risks for adolescents. Family and psychotherapeutic interventions are most effective for prepubertal children.",

In evaluating emotion, mood, and affect, a clinician needs to take into account the full clinical context. When making an assessment of this aspect of mental status, observations of the patient's behavior should be integrated with what the patient reports about his/her feeling state. Although episodes of extreme fear, terror, dread, and/or the sense that “something horrible is going to happen” may be experienced with post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, or paranoid psychoses, these emotions also may be caused by seizures and other medical conditions. A catastrophic reaction is a sudden breakthrough of intense, overwhelming emotional distress that may occur if the patient is pressed beyond his/her ability to cope. “Thought form” refers to the structure of thought and is distinct from thought content.",

      "abstract": "Medication nonadherence is common among patients with schizophrenia and due to a variety of factors including lack of insight, psychopathology, substance use disorder, issues associated with treatment, stigma, fragmentation of care, cultural influences, and socioeconomic status. Among this population, nonadherence is problematic because it can lead to decompensation or exacerbation of symptoms, relapse, rehospitalization or greater use of emergency psychiatric services, functional decline, and increased risk of death. Psychoeducational approaches alone are ineffective, but in combination with behavioral interventions, appear to be effective. Involving the patient's support system, in addition to other interventions, can improve treatment adherence. Many medication-related factors, such as effectiveness and tolerability of antipsychotics, regimen complexity, and past medication trials impact appropriate medication use. Therefore, optimizing the patient's pharmacotherapeutic regimens can improve adherence. Additional factors favorably influencing adherence include involving the patient in their treatment, fostering a therapeutic alliance, implementing/using reminder systems, and addressing substance use disorder. Medication nonadherence arises from multiple reasons that vary between patients. Thus, the most effective strategies to improve adherence are multifactorial and may involve both psychoeducational and behavioral techniques, as well as previously listed approaches. Strategies should be targeted toward the patient and their support system, whenever possible, to further improve the chances of appropriate medication use. Recognizing that all patients with schizophrenia are at risk for medication nonadherence is important. No one technique has been shown to be most effective; therefore, the risk for nonadherence should continually be assessed and multiple strategies should be targeted to the patient (and caregiver) and repeatedly implemented throughout the course of the patient's illness.",

It was established that taking into account special working conditions, the personnel of the State Criminal-Executive Service of Ukraine&nbsp;&nbsp;is under the permanent influence of various stress factors, experiences negative emotions and is often in destructive psychological states, which can lead to the development of manifestations of addictive behavior. It was determined that the formation of the addictive behavior covers two stages – experiencing of an acute change in the mental state at the emotional level and the formation of a certain sequence of appeals to the means of addiction, which is common for different forms of such behavior. It has been found that among the representatives of bodies and institutions of execution of punishments the most common are socially acceptable or neutral or comparatively dangerous types of addictive behavior, in particular computer or Internet addiction, workaholism, etc. Among the more socially dangerous forms of addictive behavior, chemical addictions (the use of alcohol and other psychoactive substances – cannabinoids, opiates, psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, etc.), hallucinogens of natural and synthetic origin, as well as the abuse of hypnotic-sedative drugs) and non-chemical addictions (addictions), which at this time, according to researchers, there are currently more than two hundred forms (pathological tendency to gambling; ludomania – sweepstakes, lotteries, slot machines, casinos, less often – card games) are common. On the basis of the conducted research, the need to develop a set of organizational measures in order to prevent the manifestations of addictive behavior of the personnel of the State Criminal-Executive Service of Ukraine, their timely detection and correct diagnosis, as well as instruments of influence for the purpose of correction is emphasized.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that cognitive and behavioral interventions have enduring effects that reduce risk for subsequent symptom return following treatment termination. These enduring effects have been most clearly demonstrated with respect to depression and the anxiety disorders. It remains unclear whether these effects are a consequence of the amelioration of the causal processes that generate risk or the introduction of compensatory strategies that offset them and whether these effects reflect the mobilization of cognitive or other mechanisms. No such enduring effects have been observed for the psychoactive medications, which appear to be largely palliative in nature. Other psychosocial interventions remain largely untested, although claims that they produce lasting change have long been made. Whether such enduring effects extend to other disorders remains to be seen, but the capacity to reduce risk following treatment termination is one of the major benefits provided by the cognitive and behavioral interventions with respect to the treatment of depression and the anxiety disorders.",

      "title": "Epilepsy after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

Neurotoxic substances act by altering the ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to generate and/or transmit excitation to the peripheric nervous system by affecting the ability to synthesize neurotransmitters and the normal functioning of its own fundamental structural components (neurons, nerves, glial cells and synapses). The most important diagnostic coordinates in intoxications are represented by the sudden onset of clinical signs, their compatibility and in particular, the source of exposure or access to toxicants/toxins. The therapeutic management in neurotoxicoses refers to the stabilization of the animal, toxicological decontamination, antidote, stimulation of toxic excretion, to which is added the symptomatic treatment. In general, neurotoxicoses are associated with either CNS depression, coma or paralysis, or CNS stimulation or seizures, but unfortunately not even a small portion of the potentially neurotoxic compounds that exist can be adequately addressed in a single presentation.",

Many measures used to prevent or reduce jet lag are inappropriate or ineffective and some may even be dangerous, such as use of melatonin. One of the most reliable preventive techniques consists of reinforcing social synchronizers by maintaining exposure to sunlight and social activity. Only two drugs currently available on the market can be recommended, i.e. non-benzodiazepinic hypnotics which induce high quality sleep to allow quick recovery and a new time-release caffeine agent which has been shown to prolong psychomotor performance.",

      "title": "A legal study of children with emotional disturbance and mental health needs and implications for practice.",
      "abstract": "I. OVERVIEWAccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 5.1% of children aged 4-17 years have parents who identified that their child has an emotional or behavioral difficulty.1 Additionally, almost 2.9 million children have been prescribed medication for such difficulties.2 These emotional or behavioral difficulties may include a variety of mental disorders captured under various umbrella terms such as emotional disturbance (ED), behavioral disorders, or mental illness.3 As National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities indicates, [b]eneath these umbrella terms, there is actually a wide range of specific conditions that differ from one another in their characteristics and treatment.4 These conditions include (but are not limited to): anxiety disorders; bipolar disorder (sometimes called manic-depression); conduct disorders; eating disorders; obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD); psychotic disorders;5 disruptive behavior; pervasive development; and elimination, affective, schizophrenic, and tic disorders.6 Equally varied is etiology of an ED with origins in adverse childhood experiences, such as child abuse, neglect, growing up in extremely dysfunctional homes, and genetic predisposition.7Mental health problems and symptoms can range from very mild to extremely severe, including instances when hospitalization is necessary to treat most serious cases.8 A child may be suffering from mental illness if they show following general symptons: changes in school performance, drug abuse, inability to cope, changes in sleeping, defying authority, frequent outbursts of anger, and hyperactivity.9 Serious symptoms can include: hearing voices, hallucinating, and aggressive behavior.10Statistics have also highlighted that mental illness in children often remains undiscovered for far too long11 with an estimated one-third of mental illnesses in children being undetected.12 However, mental illnesses can be diagnosed or recognized during childhood as half of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin[] by age 14 and three-quarters by age 24.13Diagnosis is particularly critical because it is a widely held and fundamental principle that early identification14 and detection is key to meeting needs of individuals with disabilities; mental illness is no exception. In a State Legislation Report, National Alliance on Mental Illness states that:[T]he shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn, provided a major impetus for lawmakers to propose legislation which would impact children and adults living with mental illness. Mental illness came to forefront of nation's attention when medical records revealed that shooter's mother was increasingly concerned about his deteriorating mental health and had been dissatisfied with lack of school services dating back to middle school.15The Alliance posits that nature of these tragedies underscores the lack of access to mental health services and barriers that many families and individuals face in light of nation's fragmented and grossly inadequate mental health system.16 In reaction to Newtown tragedy, mental health organizations advocated for policies supporting early identification and intervention; training for school personnel, families, and public; mental health services in schools; and increased access to care.17 Action at state level has seen legislators taking a proactive role in identification process by increasing mental health screening, identifying emerging mental illness in children and adolescents, ensuring adequate access to care, focusing on early intervention, providing school-based services, and providing staff training to prevent future tragedies.18There are varied reasons why early detection of mental illnesses in children has been traditionally problematic.19 According to Yael Zakai Cannon, there are many challenges that families and children with mental health needs experience in an attempt to secure appropriate behavioral and educational services. …",

      "title": "AGMATINE AMELIORATES SOCIAL ISOLATION INDUCED OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR IN MICE",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is defined as recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses (obsession) and/or repetitive purposeful behaviors (compulsions). 13% of children and adults are suffering from this condition. There are evidences that increased OCD symptom severity has been linked with diminished quality of life [3] and also increased functional impairment. Social isolation is defined as a state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others, has a minimal number of social contacts and they are deficient in fulfilling and quality relationships.Social isolation (SI) causes a variety of behavioral changes like hyper-locomotion, anxiety, impulsivity, aggression. These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia, depression. In addition, Social isolation and OCD are associated with similar neurochemical changes like hypofunction of serotonin, dopamine and glutamate hyperfunction.These changes might be one of the causes for exacerbation of OCB in social isolation. Agmatine [4(amino butyl) guanidine] is an endogenous amine, widely present in mammalian brain and proposed as a novel neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.It is a metabolite of L-arginine via arginine decarboxylase and hydrolyzed to putrescine and urea by agmatinase. Recently, Agmatine is evidenced for anti-compulsive like effect . It has also been reported for its effectiveness in schizophrenia , addictive behavior , stress,anxiety [11] and depression . Besides this, Agmatine is evidenced for modulating levels of serotonin [13] as well as dopamine and glutamate levels .Incidentally, these neurotransmitters levels are altered in social isolation and OCD. [14] Hence, in the present study, the effect of agmatine was investigated in social isolation induced OCD in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Animals Adult male albino Swiss mice (22–25 g) were group housed (n=6) under a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled conditions of temperature (23 ± 2C) and humidity (55 ± 10%). Mice were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7 days before carrying out the experiments. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) (SCOP/IAEC/2013/14/151). Drugs Agmatine sulfate was purchased from SigmaAldrich Ltd., USA. Drug solutions were prepared fresh and doses are expressed in terms of their free bases. Isolation condition Mice were housed singly in cages (21 x 38 x 14 cm) under a controlled 12-hour/12-hour light-dark cycle, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions), repetitive ritualistic behaviors (compulsions) and excessive anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is classified as an anxiety disorder under DSM-IV-TR guidelines. In OCD, the levels of serotonin and nitric oxide decreased; whereas levels of dopamine and glutamate increased in brain. Environmental conditions such as isolation from social surroundings lead to anxiety and increased level of aggression. The present study was designed to examine the effect of agmatine in social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior on marble burying behavior and locomotor activity. Agmatine (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in different groups of mice; activity was observed 30 min after dosing. Acute treatment of agmatine (40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced marble burying behavior. Moreover, hyperlocomotion was observed in socially isolated animals and agmatine was found to attenuate the same without affecting basal locomotions. In conclusion, agmatine effectively decreases social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior in mice.",

They often induce a distress in the family, an individual sadness possibly leaving at time to maltreatment. In the normal infant or the medically fragile infant due to prematurity or an acute episode, complaints from the patient or family sources force the medical team to find an explanation or a treatment, which are not always adequate. In other conditions such as asthma, obesity, anorexia nervosa, autism, cerebral palsy, hyperactivity, the sleeping disorders may be so unnoticed or remain insufficiently investigated. Globally, in this domain, the clinical description is often imprecise and sleep studies underused. A more accurate assessment should lead to a better educative approach and more appropriate therapy.",

As noted in Chapter 1, dysfunction of the human mind results in symptoms in three primary spheres: thinking (cognition), emotion (meaning), and motivation (ability to set and achieve goals). These disorders can also produce a variety of physical (or “neurovegetative”) symptoms that include changes in appetite, sleep, sexual function, and energy level, among others. Some people develop symptoms suggestive of other medical or neurological disorders, such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, and memory disturbances. Additionally, patients with serious medical and neurological disorders can develop psychiatric disorders (e.g., people with diabetes are prone to develop depression), with adverse effects likely affecting the outcome of both conditions.",

      "abstract": "Neurofeedback is a kind of biofeedback, which teaches self-control of brain functions to subjects by measuring brain waves and providing a feedback signal. Neurofeedback usually provides the audio and or video feedback. Positive or negative feedback is produced for desirable or undesirable brain activities, respectively. In this review, we provided clinical and technical information about the following issues: (1) Various neurofeedback treatment protocols i.e. alpha, beta, alpha/theta, delta, gamma, and theta; (2) Different EEG electrode placements i.e. standard recording channels in the frontal, temporal, central, and occipital lobes; (3) Electrode montages (unipolar, bipolar); (4) Types of neurofeedback i.e. frequency, power, slow cortical potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and so on; (5) Clinical applications of neurofeedback i.e. treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, drug addiction, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, dyslexia and dyscalculia, autistic spectrum disorders and so on as well as other applications such as pain management, and the improvement of musical and athletic performance; and (6) Neurofeedback softwares. To date, many studies have been conducted on the neurofeedback therapy and its effectiveness on the treatment of many diseases. Neurofeedback, like other treatments, has its own pros and cons. Although it is a non-invasive procedure, its validity has been questioned in terms of conclusive scientific evidence. For example, it is expensive, time-consuming and its benefits are not long-lasting. Also, it might take months to show the desired improvements. Nevertheless, neurofeedback is known as a complementary and alternative treatment of many brain dysfunctions. However, current research does not support conclusive results about its efficacy.",

Although many methods have been used to measure the presence and severity of cognitive symptoms, little progress has been made in defining and contrasting possible determinants of cognitive dysfunction. We propose a theoretical framework that describes impairments of higher mental functions in terms of both \"extrinsic\" noncognitive processes and \"intrinsic\" cognitive processes. The latter include effort (capacity) demanding processes; automatic processes; episodic (recent biographical) memory; and processes involved in accessing previously acquired knowledge. Noncognitive processes include sensitivity to reinforcement, activation, sensorimotor function, and mood. Each of these processes can be expressed at the time of information acquisition or retrieval from memory. Findings from clinical studies of patients suffering amnestic disorders, progressive dementias, and mood disorders illustrate the utility of such a model for understanding some of the determinants of cognitive dysfunction, for developing diagnostic tools, and for considering therapeutic strategies that may be useful in treating cognitive dysfunctions.",

Effective treatment techniques such as patients education and counseling, sleep hygiene, stimulus control and relaxation techniques should be known to every therapist, especially general practitioners who treat the majority of patients haring difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Several other effective behavioural techniques, e.g. sleep restriction, or cognitive therapy, and psychotherapy should be used only by skilled and trained experts. Insomniacs with chronic and severe complaints should be treated by therapists with experience in sleep medicine. Multimodal treatment strategies are provided for by sleep disorder centres and combine effective treatment elements in structured therapeutic concepts.

These behavioral symptoms can be a major cause of stress, anxiety and concern for caregivers. While psychotropic drugs are frequently used to control these symptoms, they have the potential for significant side effects, which include sedation, disinhibition, depression, falls, incontinence, parkinsonism and akathisias. On examination of the consequences of adverse events, somnolence, as well as postural instability and postural hypotension, have been noted. All patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other progressive dementias will advance through stages of moderate-to-severe AD unless effective treatments suspend transition from mild deterioration to dementia, or competitive mortality truncates survival. Treatment trials suggest that these patients respond to both disease-modifying (such as inhibitors of cholinesterase and butirrylcholinesterase) and symptomatic (such as neuroleptics) agents. Relatively few studies have been conducted in this patient population, and more information regarding the type of behavioral disturbances exhibited, how best to measure them in this disabled population and their optimum treatment are urgently needed.",

During the clinical conversation, the patient is very withdrawn, isolated and does not want to talk. Appreciating her silence, the use of art therapy was seen as appropriate. Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient. Art therapy was used to assess her emotional, cognitive and rational state. Its use increased the efficiency of assessment and promoted the definition of treatment objectives.

Deficiency of postsynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin and a surplus of presynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA and glutamate (mainly a postsynaptic excitatory and partly a presynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter), can be found in the involved brain regions. However, neuropeptide alterations (galanin, neuropeptide Y, substance P) also play an important role in its pathogenesis. A neural network is described, including the alterations of neuroactive substances at specific subreceptors. Currently, major depression is treated with monoamine reuptake inhibitors. An additional therapeutic option could be the administration of antagonists of presynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitters or the administration of agonists/antagonists of neuropeptides.",

      "title": "Mechanism of Action of Atypical Antipsychotic Drugs in Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the early 1990s. Unlike typical antipsychotics, which are effective only against positive symptoms of schizophrenia, atypical antipsychotics are effective against negative and cognitive symptoms as well. Furthermore, they are effective not only in psychotic but also in affective disorders, on their own or as adjuncts to antidepressant drugs. This review presents the neural mechanisms of currently existing atypical antipsychotics and putative antipsychotics currently being investigated in preclinical and clinical studies and how these relate to their effectiveness in mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Typical antipsychotics act almost exclusively on the dopamine system. Atypical drugs, however, modulate serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine, and/or histamine neurotransmission as well. This multimodal mechanism of action putatively underlies the beneficial effect of atypical antipsychotics in mood and anxiety disorders. Interestingly, novel experimental drugs having dual antipsychotic and antidepressant therapeutic potential, such as histamine, adenosine, and trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR) ligand, are also characterized by a multimodal stimulatory effect on central 5-HT, norepinephrine, and/or histamine transmission. The multimodal stimulatory effect on central monoamine neurotransmission may be thus primarily responsible for the combined antidepressant and antipsychotic therapeutic potential of certain central nervous system (CNS) drugs.",

As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs.

      "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for a host of psychiatric, developmental, medical, and neurocognitive conditions, often resulting in debilitating and long-term consequences. However, there is no available neuropsychological resource reviewing the literature on the associated neurocognitive deficits in children and adolescents. This review comprehensively examines the 23 prior studies that evaluated the intellectual, language, visual-spatial, memory, motor, and/or attention/executive functions in children and adolescents following an experience of childhood abuse and/or neglect. Neurocognitive impairments were frequently reported. Impairments in executive functions were the most frequent and severe reported impairments, although intelligence, language, visual-spatial skills, and memory are also at serious risk for compromised development following maltreatment. However, specific factors such as abuse/neglect duration, severity, type, and timing during development were all associated with neurocognition. This indicates that these factors are of greater importance than just the presence of abuse/neglect in identifying risk for neurocognitive compromise. Such neurocognitive deficits appear to be a consequence to the known neurobiological and brain development abnormalities of this population, suggesting traumatic stress can be a potential cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings have critical implications for the clinical practice and research involving children following childhood maltreatment and other types of traumatic stress.",

Most clinically important antiseizure medication (ASM) interactions with other drugs result from induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing hepatic enzymes or significant protein binding properties. Other mechanisms, such as pharmacodynamic interactions between drugs, also may plat a role. Because many ASMs are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of hepatic enzymes and do exhibit significant protein binding, drug interactions are common in patients with epilepsy. Patients who have renal or hepatic disorders are especially vulnerable to drug interactions.",

The presence of third parties or the use of tape recorders are not satisfactory for the prevention of delusion formation. Rather, the physician using hypnosis should focus upon: (a) preliminary psychological evaluation and selection of patients free from disposition to delusion formation; (b) awareness of his own emotional responses to the patient. Attention to these factors will minimize the chance of delusion formation after the use of hypnosis.",

      "title": "Critical Review of Alcohol, Alcoholism and the Withdrawal Symptoms I. Mechanisms of Addiction and Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Alcoholic beverages are socially accepted around the world, consumed mostly to socialize, celebrate, and relax. The pleasant effects of alcohol are attributed to (i) an increase in GABAergic (inhibitory signals), OPergic and 5HTergic (euphoric effects) neuronal activities and (ii) a decrease in DAergic ('want' signal or craving), Gluergic (excitatory signals), NEergic (stress signals) neuronal, and the HPA axis (stress hormones) activities. If alcohol drinking continues, the receptors are sensitized, resulting in development of tolerance when alcohol drinking must be increased to achieve desired effects. In genetically/Environmentally predisposed subjects, chronic alcohol drinking results in the development of addiction, characterized by a condition when alcohol caseation results in rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms including, but not limited to, alcohol craving and moderate to severe discomfort. Because pharmacotherapy alone or in combination with behavioral approaches is only modestly effective in treating alcoholism symptoms, there is an urgent need to development effective and safe therapies. At present, a lack of clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying addiction hinders possible development of new treatment strategies. Therefore, the aim of this article is to discuss the mechanisms underlying (i) the euphoric, relaxing and adverse effects of alcohol drinking and (ii) addiction and the withdrawal symptoms.",

      "title": "A Review of the Biological Mechanisms of Dexmedetomidine for Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Postoperative neurocognitive disorders are common neurological complications following surgery that are generally characterized by varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Postoperative neurocognitive disorders can exhibit as short-term postoperative delirium and/or long-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In addition, postoperative neurocognitive disorders may result in poor outcomes in patients, and are a leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Recently, there has been a heightened interest in mechanisms and clinical treatments for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. Though some influencing factors and mechanisms of postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been revealed, they remain troublesome problems in clinical departments. Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used anesthetic adjuvant that may help improve postoperative cognitive impairment, especially the conditions of a postoperative acute event (postoperative delirium, within 1 week after operation) and delayed neurocognitive recovery (postoperative cognitive dysfunction, up to 30 days). In the recent literature, dexmedetomidine has been shown to exert positive effects on cognitive impairment in clinical and animal studies, especially for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. However, not all clinical findings support this efficacy. Though some mechanisms of dexmedetomidine on postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been proposed, such as signaling pathways associated with inflammation and apoptosis, this evidence is fragmentary and disputed in the literature. Therefore, this article aims to review the potential biological mechanisms underlying dexmedetomidine's effects on postoperative neurocognitive disorders, providing a reference for future studies.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive medication is frequently used in methadone maintenance treatment programs (MMP) to treat comorbid mental disorders (depression, anxiety, schizophrenia) in opiate-addicts. Thus, several pharmacological interactions are possible. This problem becomes more relevant with the introduction of new CNS-drugs like SSRI, atypical antipsychotics or new anticonvulsants. The most common interactions seen in practice are pharmacodynamic in nature, most often due to the cumulative effects of different drugs on the central nervous system (e.g. neuroleptics or benzodiazepine interactions). However important pharmacokinetic interactions may occur particularly between methadone and antidepressant drugs: Desipramine plasma levels are increased by methadone; further fluvoxamine (and fluoxetine to a less extent) may cause an important increase in serum methadone concentrations. The inhibition of different clusters of the cytochrome P450 system are involved in these interactions. Several lines of evidence suggest that benzodiazepines and methadone may have synergistic interactions and that opiate sedation or respiratory depression could be increased. This is a serious problem, given the widespread use of benzodiazepines among MMPpatients. Experimental but not clinical data support methadone and lithium interactions. Finally, classic anticonvulsant drugs, such asphenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, produce dramatic decreases in methadone levels, which may precipitate a withdrawal syndrome; valproic acid and the new anticonvulsant drugs do not have these effects. Accordingly, caution is advised in the clinical use of methadone when other CNS-drugs are administered.",

Refractory delirium, dyspnoea or pain are the most common indications. If deep palliative sedation is used, the estimated life expectancy should be a few days to at most one week. Midazolam is used most often for continuous sedation, usually by subcutaneous infusion; if the response is insufficient, a combination of midazolam with levomepromazine or phenobarbital or monotreatment with propofol may be used. If continuous infusion is not desired or feasible, intermittent administration of midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam or chlorpromazine may be considered.

While the symptom has been regarded as the symbolic representation of the event, its appearance and persistence have been variously attributed to the intensity of the trauma, the circumstances surrounding its occurrence, to the need for the symptoms to substitute for a repressed drive, wish, or fear and to the factor of secondary gain. Our interest in the subject of conversion hysteria originated during a study of the behavioral effects of acute brain injuries, when it was noted that subjects who developed hysterical anesthesias and paralyses recalled their accidents and described their injuries in language of violence. In contrast, patients without hysterical symptoms were either amnestic for or confabulatory about accident and injury, or used language which did not emphasize the physically traumatic aspects of the",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

Insomnia is a common sleep disorder, particularly among older adults, and is often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric conditions. Psychological factors play a critical role in onset and maintenance of chronic insomnia, such that cognitions and behaviors that occur in response to difficulty sleeping inadvertently condition arousal when attempting to sleep. In most cases, assessment of insomnia in clinical settings occurs via interview and self-monitoring using daily sleep diaries. The most well-established interventions for insomnia include cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic medications. CBT-I focuses on altering behaviors and cognitions that maintain insomnia using stimulus control and sleep restriction, among other strategies. CBT-I is considered the initial treatment of choice due to its strong efficacy and lower risk of adverse events as compared with pharmacotherapy.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc. In questo senso la diagnosi e la terapia (farmacologica o psicoterapica) sono di stretta competenza psichiatrica ed utili per la comprensione della criminalita ma non sufficienti perche non costituiscono gli unici fattori causali.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent or acute insomnia is common and may sometimes require short term treatment with approved hypnotic agents. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder, however, indicates that poor night-time sleep is chronic and is accompanied by significant impairment of daytime functioning. Although insomnia disorder often co-exists with psychiatric and medical conditions, it is viewed as an independent entity with potentially serious sequelae, requiring its own treatment, usually in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), with or without pharmacotherapy.",

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated. The authors report no financial or other relationship relevant to the subject of this article.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem. Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits such as dementia. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM. In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycaemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglyacemia have deleterious effect on the brain. Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycaemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits. Hypoglycaemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic hyperglycaemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function such as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function. The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia-related cognitive dysfunction include, macro- and microvascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycaemia on the brain, advanced glycation end-products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Hyperglycaemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus. Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM. The knowledge that diagnosis at an early age, frequency of hypoglycaemia, poor glycaemic control and presence of risk factors negatively affect cognitive functions in DM will have important implications for treatment and research purposes.",

      "abstract": "We present diagnostic criteria for mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS) for inclusion into the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders. The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

      "abstract": "Dissociative disorders involve a division of an organism-environment or ecological system into subsystems. Each subsystem or dissociative agent brings forth his or her own, however rudimentary, experience and idea of self, world, and self as a part of this world. The disorders manifest in dissociative symptoms. Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "title": "NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS IN OLDER PEOPLE: A DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGE AND A TREATABLE CONDITION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Lacking the typical phenotypic features of seizures and the adverse systemic consequences of prolonged convulsions, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) was incorrectly assumed not to cause neuronal injury.1 Unfortunately, NCSE is associated with morbidity and mortality due to neuronal damage from abnormal electrical activity and its association with the acute neurological disorders that may precipitate it.2,3 This becomes more apparent in the geriatric population, in which impaired baseline mental status hampers diagnosis even further, and the brain parenchyma is more sensitive to prolonged abnormal electrical activity. To determine the prevalence, clinical features, and course of NCSE in the elderly population, an observational prospective study was conducted of all consecutive patients with acute unexplained change in mental,cognitive, or behavioral status or confusion that was the cause of hospitalization or had occurred during hospitalization in the Department of Geriatrics, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, over a 24-month period. Typical electroencephalogram (EEG) changes were required to establish the diagnosis of NCSE.4 Clinical improvement was defined as resumption of the previous (baseline) mental status and disappearance of epileptic activity on EEG. Within a 2-year period seven of 307 hospitalized patients, aged 73 and older, were diagnosed with NCSE (Table 1). Of the seven patients (4 women and 3 men, aged 73–90, mean age 82.7), only one had a previous history of epilepsy; three had renal insufficiency. All patients presented with acute altered mental state: confusion, stupor or coma, without concomitant clinical convulsive activity. In three patients, the presenting symptom was refusal to eat. Time until diagnosis ranged from 1 to 5 days (mean 3 days). All seven patients had generalized NCSE on EEG that disappeared with intravenous diazepam injection (5–8 mg) in the five patients to whom it was given and in all patients on follow-up. None of the patients had focal status epilepticus on EEG. Patients were treated with an intravenous loading dose of phenytoin (800–1,000 mg) or valproic acid (20 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance dose. In six patients, clinical improvement was achieved within 1 to 4 days (mean 2.2 days). None of the medications that the patients were taking are known to cause seizures. In the patients with renal failure, the clinical and encephalographic improvement was chronologically related to the antiepileptic treatment and not to renal function improvement. One patient died of sepsis 19 days after the diagnosis of NCSE. All other six patients were discharged from the hospital after they regained their previous mental and neurological status. We describe seven elderly patients with generalized NCSE. Although the diagnosis was delayed in all, they improved after diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Several features characterize the present series: old age (6 of 7 patients aged ≥80), high incidence (2.3%) of NCSE,5,6 only one patient with a previous history of epilepsy (unlike in other series in which up to 50% of patients were known to suffer from a convulsive disorder),2,3,7 and a benign outcome. Impairment of baseline cognitive abilities and confusion was the presenting symptom in five of seven patients. The fact that NCSE in most of the patients occurred under medical conditions that can cause acute mental status change highlights the diagnostic difficulty and the important role of EEG (sometimes at least as important as imaging) in the evaluation of abrupt mental or behavioral changes in the elderly population. Although the outcome of NCSE is variable, mortality has been reported to reach 50% in critically ill patients,6,8 and in the geriatric age group, NCSE might cause permanent neurological damage.9 Whether the good outcome in our series can be attributed, in part, to the fact that, in all these patients, epileptic activity was generalized and not focal, remains speculative. In addition, because a systemic, metabolic, or infectious condition (renal insufficiency, sepsis, or hypothermia) could have triggered the NCSE in five of seven, the reversibility of these causes may account, in part, for the relatively benign outcome. Although intravenous treatment of seizures is considered to be associated with morbidity and mortality in older people because of hypotensive, cardiac depressant and sedative effects of antiepileptic drugs,10 our experience suggests that, with the appropriate indications and when taking the proper precautions, such therapy is well tolerated in elderly patients with NCSE.",

      "title": "Finding Genes for Parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "abstract": "The article lays out a theoretical analysis of the problem with diagnosing apathy in today's research. Apathy is a state characterized by a simultaneous decrease in the behavioral, cognitive and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior due to loss of motivation [15]. Behavioral changes lie in a declining everyday problem-solving effectiveness at home or work. Cognitive changes result in reduced cognitive functioning and a lack of plans and life strategies. Emotional changes manifest in a decrease in affective response to events that previously elicited either a positive or negative emotional response. Diagnostic criteria, or the 'gold standard' for apathy, identify behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social symptoms of apathy that cause clinically significant disorders in personal, social, professional, or other important areas of life. The differential diagnosis of apathy involves its clinical distinction from syndromes such as delirium, dementia, depression, abulia, akinesia, and demoralization. The review can be useful for psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and all practitioners who interact with people at risk of developing apathetic states.",

Les comorbidités les plus fréquemment retrouvées sont les pathologies anxieuses, les addictions, et certains troubles ou traits de personnalité (borderline, neuroticisme) [1]. La présence de telles comorbidités compromet le pronostic de la maladie dépressive, avec une diminution des taux de rémission et de réponse aux traitements, un allongement du délai d’action, un tableau clinique plus sévère, une altération du fonctionnement et une chronicisation. Les comorbidités psychiatriques sont considérées comme un des facteurs participant à la résistance thérapeutique pour 20 à 30 % des épisodes [2]. Cette absence de réponse pourrait être plus particulièrement associée à certains sous-types et phénotypes cliniques de dépression poussant alors à la recherche de biomarqueurs spécifiques (électrophysiologiques, anatomiques et fonctionnels, métaboliques, et génétiques) de chacune de ces formes cliniques afin d’améliorer la compréhension même de la pathologie et son pronostic [3]. Par ailleurs, les recommandations ne définissent pas de stratégies précises en cas de dépressions avec comorbidités psychiatriques, les études randomisées, contrôlées classiquement menées ayant généralement tendance à exclure ces patients, et notamment ceux présentant une addiction associée. Il est néanmoins possible que le traitement de la dépression puisse améliorer le trouble comorbide, comme en témoigne la place aujourd’hui occupée par les antidépresseurs dans la pharmacothérapie des troubles anxieux [4]. Ces données soulèvent des questions cliniques, thérapeutiques et de recherche importantes, centrées sur une meilleure identification des facteurs de risque de la résistance en abordant le problème central de la comorbidité psychiatrique qu’il est essentiel de repérer dans le cadre d’une prise en charge globale du patient déprimé.",

      "title": "REVIEW: Behavioural assessment of drug reinforcement and addictive features in rodents: an overview",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Some psychoactive drugs are abused because of their ability to act as reinforcers. As a consequence behavioural patterns (such as drug‐seeking/drug‐taking behaviours) are promoted that ensure further drug consumption. After prolonged drug self‐administration, some individuals lose control over their behaviour so that these drug‐seeking/taking behaviours become compulsive, pervading almost all life activities and precipitating the loss of social compatibility. Thus, the syndrome of addictive behaviour is qualitatively different from controlled drug consumption. Drug‐induced reinforcement can be assessed directly in laboratory animals by either operant or non‐operant self‐administration methods, by classical conditioning‐based paradigms such as conditioned place preference or sign tracking, by facilitation of intracranial electric self‐stimulation, or, alternatively by drug‐induced memory enhancement. In contrast, addiction cannot be modelled in animals, at least as a whole, within the constraints of the laboratory. However, various procedures have been proposed as possible rodent analogues of addiction’s major elements including compulsive drug seeking, relapse, loss of control/impulsivity, and continued drug consumption despite negative consequences. This review provides an extensive overview and a critical evaluation of the methods currently used for studying drug‐induced reinforcement as well as specific features of addictive behaviour. In addition, comic strips that illustrate behavioural methods used in the drug abuse field are provided given for free download under http://www.zi‐mannheim/psychopharmacology.de",

This review outlines each of these treatment strategies, reviews the rationale and evidence base currently existing for the use of multimodal rather than unimodal treatments (i.e., medication or behavioral intervention alone), and discusses potential moderators of multimodal treatment efficacy, as well as future directions for research, that may better inform clinical practice.",

Die motorische und sensible Elektroneurographie zeigen eine Minderung der Amplituden von Muskel- und Nervensummenaktionspotentialen (MSAP/NSAP). Veränderungen im EMG finden sich in der Frühphase der Erkrankung nicht. Mit einer aufwändigen elektrophysiologischen Technik wurden Veränderungen der Nerven- und Muskelfaser-Erregbarkeit beschrieben, die als Zeichen einer Fehlfunktion von Na-Kanälen interpretiert wurden. Eine neue, auf jedem EMG-Gerät durchführbare 0,2–0,5 Hz Serienreizung der motorischen Nerven oder direkt des Muskels führt bei CIPNM zu einer starken Fazilitierung der MSAP und eignet sich als diagnostisches Kriterium. Die hochgradige Variabilität der Fazilitierung spricht für eine fluktuierende, dysfunktionelle Neuromyopathie. Sensible Nerven zeigten nur selten eine geringe Fazilitierung. Als pathogene Faktoren wurden fokale Ischämie mit Hypoxie und toxische Entzündungs-Botenstoffe vermutet, die ein Energiedefizit erzeugen und neben anderem Na-Kanäle funktionell beeinträchtigen könnten.",

      "abstract": "Bizarre repetitive behaviour may be quite common, with estimates in people and dogs of a prevalence of up to 8%. Whereas these are often considered important indicators of mental health problems in people, in companion animals, many owners view these behaviours as quirky or even amusing features of their pet. However, the absence of self-report also means that the array of repetitive behaviour conditions in companion animals is also much more diverse than in humans and there is a danger of drawing simple analogies between human and non-human animals based on very superficial phenotypic features. For example, the following differentials might be considered for a dog who chases its tail:\r\n •Seizure possibly a primary partial seizure or secondary to a lesion in the brain such as damage to the vestibular system \r\n•Inner ear infection \r\n•Play \r\n•Pain in the tail or lower back due to damage to the nerves (neuralgia), bones or soft tissues \r\n•Pain around the region of the tail including skin inflammation and infections, impacted or infected anal sacs or trauma \r\n•A learned response aimed at attracting owner attention. \r\n•Acute conflict\r\n•Compulsive Disorder \r\n•Stereotypy \r\n\r\nThese explanations are not independent and a dog who starts chasing his tail for one reason may subsequently learn to do it at other times in order to gain attention, or the frequent repetition of the behaviour may potentially result in neurological sensitization and the expression of the behaviour becoming emancipated from its original triggering stimuli. From the simple (and by no means definitive) list of differentials for tail chasing given above it should be obvious that underlying cognition can vary enormously with a given presenting stereotypic behaviour. This presentation considers the value but also limitations of using companion animals as models of human conditions and especially the value of using real world rather than laboratory models.",

Tiene pautado tratamiento con clorazepato dipotásico 50mg/12 horas y alprazolam 2mg/8 horas, aunque refiere un abuso de benzodiazepinas a dosis superiores. Al tercer día del ingreso, comienza a presentar un cuadro de inquietud psicomotora, alteraciones sensoperceptivas en forma de alucinaciones auditivas y visuales con gran repercusión afectiva y conductual, así como autorreferencialidad, suspicacia e irritabilidad. Muestra un discurso presivo y acelerado, no obstante, no se valoran otros síntomas compatibles con sintomatología afectiva mayor. Se mantiene consciente y orientado en las diferentes esferas y no existen fluctuaciones en la clínica, lo que lleva a descartar un síndrome confusional agudo. RESULTADOS Y CONCLUSIONES: Se orienta el caso como un episodio psicótico en el contexto de abstinencia a tóxicos y se añade olanzapina 10mg/24 horas al tratamiento, produciéndose una remisión del cuadro hasta su estado basal progresivamente. El DSM-5 incluye la posibilidad de que la abstinencia a sustancias específicas pueda inducir un episodio psicótico, dentro de la sección de Trastornos psicóticos inducidos por sustancias/medicamentos, así como que la intoxicación por cannabis u otras sustancias puede inducir alteraciones de la percepción, sin embargo, no está recogido que estas puedan ser producidas por la abstinencia a los mismos.",

En este grupo de pacientes, el metabolismo y los efectos secundarios de los medicamentos antiepilepticos es diferente cuando se compara con pacientes mas jovenes. Cuando se prescribe un anticonvulsivante es importante tener en cuenta que muchos de los adultos mayores tienen otras comorbilidades y estan tomando otros medicamentos. Estos principios aplican tambien en el manejo de estado epileptico. Nuevo anticonvulsivantes de uso intravenoso como acido valproico, Levetiracetam y Lacosamida, pueden ser una opcion en el manejo del estado epileptico cuando las medicaciones convencionales estan contraindicadas o no pueden empleadas por sus efectos secundarios.

      "title": "Assistenza al paziente affetto da demenza: approccio infermieristico al wandering",
      "abstract": "PROBLEMA: le demenze costituiscono sempre di piu un problema rilevante di sanita pubblica rappresentando una delle maggiori cause di disabilita nella popolazione generale ed hanno un considerevole impatto socio-sanitario. L’Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanita, gia da qualche anno ha introdotto le demenze tra le sue priorita. Tra le diverse forme di alterazioni comportamentali, causate dalle demenze (irrequietezza, aggressivita fisica e verbale, manierismi e movimenti ripetitivi, alterazioni ciclo sono veglia, pedinare, spiare) una di particolare interesse e rappresentata dal wandering (vagabondaggio). Attualmente, nel contesto clinico, gli episodi di wandering vengono trattati prevalentemente mediante la contenzione chimica (somministrazione di terapia farmacologica) oppure nei casi di reale pericolo si procede alla contenzione fisica. Viene quindi spontaneo chiedersi: esistono modalita assistenziali alternative per trattare in modo specifico il problema, prendendosi cura della persona e migliorare la sua qualita di vita?\r\nSCOPO: Individuare secondo le evidenze scientifiche le terapie non farmacologiche (art therapy, stimolazione cognitiva, Rot o Reality Therapy, musicoterapia e Doll Therapy) piu efficaci nel trattamento, o miglioramento, del disturbo del wandering nell’assistito demente, rispetto alla contenzione fisica e farmacologica.\r\nCAMPIONE: sono stati presi in considerazione gli articoli di ricerca che hanno coinvolto gli assistiti di eta maggiore ai 65 anni, diagnosticati con una qualsiasi forma di demenza e che manifestano il sintomo comportamentale del wandering. Assistiti che vengono trattati con terapie farmacologiche, con la contenzione fisica e terapie non farmacologiche in un contesto ospedaliero o nelle case di cura.\r\nMETODI E STRUMENTI: i criteri di selezione utilizzati non hanno previsto restrizioni in merito al disegno di studio. Si e proceduto ricercando tutti gli studi free full text che comparassero i metodi di contenzione fisica e chimica negli episodi di wandering con tutta una serie di trattamenti non farmacologici, o che riguardassero in maniera separata i diversi tipi di trattamenti farmacologici e non farmacologici, per gestire detto fenomeno. La ricerca e stata condotta consultando le seguenti banche dati: MedLine, EBN Guideline, GoogleScholar, PubMed,Cinahl, Scopus. Non e stato utilizzato alcun limite attinente alla lingua.\r\nRISULTATI: sono stati reperiti 13 studi, in seguito all’applicazione dei criteri di inclusione, 9 sono stati gli studi inclusi nel lavoro di revisione:1 studio randomizzato doppio cieco, 2 revisioni della letteratura, 2 case report, 2 studi pilota,1 studio osservazionale e 1 studio qualitativo. La provenienza degli studi inclusi e piuttosto eterogenea: 1 proveniente dal South Dakota, 1 studio dalla Gran Bretagna, 1 dall’Italia, 1 dalla Germania, 1 da Praga (Repubblica Ceca), 2 dal Seoul (Corea del Sud),1 dall’Australia e 1 dal Singapore.\r\nDISCUSSIONE: i lavori inseriti in questa revisione della letteratura, seppure nella loro debolezza metodologica, portano ad evidenziare un’importante uso della contenzione farmacologica e fisica negli assistiti con demenza che presentano il sintomo comportamentale del wandering. Sia la contenzione farmacologica che quella fisica, rappresentano, attualmente la metodica di prima scelta per poter gestire al meglio l’agitazione/iperattivita motoria e il wandering negli assistiti anziani con demenza in un contesto ospedaliero o nelle case di riposo. In letteratura vi e una carenza degli studi che trattano, in maniera specifica l’importanza, l’uso e l’efficacia/inefficacia dei trattamenti non farmacologici.\r\nCONCLUSIONI: la letteratura, mostra chiaramente il fatto che non tutti i sintomi comportamentali della demenza possono essere trattati mediante l’uso dei farmaci, prevalentemente antipsicotici e benzodiazepine, e che la contenzione fisica ha effetti altamente inabilitanti ed e controindicata nel trattamento del “vagabondaggio”. Quindi, in assenza di risposte terapeutiche risolutive diventa molto importante prendersi cura della persona malata per migliorarne la qualita di vita. Un miglioramento della qualita di vita o comunque un miglioramento del wandering si e potuto nottare nell’uso della bambola terapeutica, durante gli interventi di musicoterapia e di interventi nei quali il soggetto era impegnato. Dagli studi, risulta evidente che i trattamenti non farmacologici, rispetto alla contenzione chimica e fisica, non producono effetti collaterali.",

      "abstract": "Manic episodes induced by antidepressant withdrawal are rarely reported. Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic, piperazinoazepine compound and is a noradrenergic, adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic-antagonist antidepressant that is used for the treatment of major depression and other psychiatric illnesses. There are several reported cases of manic/hypomanic episodes induced by mirtazapine withdrawal based on suspected clinical symptoms that were not confirmed by autopsy and toxicology. We present the first reported case of mirtazapine withdrawal-induced mania/hypomania associated with sudden death and confirmed by autopsy and toxicology. Our patient was a 26-year-old male who had been diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder, borderline intellectual functioning, polysubstance abuse, mild mental retardation, and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. He took only mirtazapine in the final and terminal weeks of his life and stopped taking mirtazapine 4 days before his death. He exhibited a sudden manic/hypomanic episode and died during a physical altercation during this episode. A full autopsy with comprehensive toxicologic analysis of his body fluids and tissues was performed. Autopsy revealed that he died from blunt force trauma of the head, neck, and trunk with extremely low and markedly subtherapeutic levels of mirtazapine and desmethylmirtazapine in the blood (mirtazapine: 0.005 mg/L; desmethylmirtazapine 0.011 mg/L). Advanced selective radioligand and neurochemical assays for density and affinity-binding parameters of dopamine transporter and heat shock protein 70 did not reveal any evidence of excited delirium or autonomic hyperactivity state. We recommend that toxicologic analysis of blood for antidepressants should become routine parts of autopsy protocols for the investigation of sudden death following terminal manic/hypomanic episodes for further elucidation of mania/hypomania induced by antidepressant withdrawal.",

The role of both of these substances, serotonin and noradrenaline, in the function of these mechanisms is still, however, a matter of discussion. In the last ten years it has been shown that many antidepressive drugs are not only effective in the treatment of depression but also in the treatment of many other psychiatric disorders.

      "abstract": "A stressor above a threshold magnitude, or multiple stressors applied simultaneously, cause an organism to alter its behaviour and physiology, with the aim of maintaining homeostasis. The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive; predominantly hyperactive-impulsive; and combined type. For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made: onset of symptoms has to occur before the age of seven, symptoms should have been present longer than 6 months and they must be causing significant impairment. The prevalence of ADHD is at least 5%. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence. At the age of 25, half will still have symptoms which continue to cause significant impairment. ADHD is associated with an increased rate of other disorders: mood disorders; anxiety; other behavioural disorders; autism spectrum disorders; tic disorders; specific learning difficulties; developmental co-ordination disorder and sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "Atividade epileptiforme (AE) no eletrencefalograma (EEG) é achado comum entre as crises epilépticas e, menos freqüentemente, em outras condições clínicas. AE \"subclínica\" pode estar acompanhada de distúrbio cognitivo transitório (DCT). Foram estudados 30 pacientes (27 com epilepsia) com AE generalizada ou difusa, freqüente, em EEG inicial. Em EEG subseqüente, foi avaliado o desempenho em testes de classificação visual de animais e objetos, discriminação de cores, memória verbal e auditiva, reconhecimento de padrões e estimação de tempo. Foi comparado, estatisticamente, o número de respostas corretas ou incorretas durante a AE e fora dela. DCT foi caracterizado em 43,3% dos casos. Em 23,3% a AE foi rara, não permitindo avaliação de DCT. Assim, pôde ser caracterizado comprometimento transitório de atividades cognitivas durante AE até então considerada \"subclínica\". Há necessidade de pesquisar a importância desse fator em pacientes com comprometimento cognitivo e de caracterizar as situações de eventuais benefícios na medicação dirigida à AE.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin has been implicated in mediating diverse physiologic and psychologic processes. The anatomy and complex pharmacology of brain-serotonin systems enables this neurotransmitter to broadly affect normal and abnormal behaviors. It appears that serotonin plays a role in multiple psychopathologies, including anxiety, depression, mood disorders, aggressive acting out, alcohol-related syndromes, and disinhibitory disorders characterized by impulsivity. It would not be surprising, therefore, if drugs that alter the dynamics of serotonergic neurotransmission prove to be effective in multiple clinical settings. Such agents may treat broad symptom clusters common to multiple nosologic categories. The new generation of serotonergic anxiolytics, including buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone, and SM-3997, which interact potently with 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A receptors, may prove to be such symptom cluster drugs. There is a scientific rationale for exploring the clinical utility of these agents in anxiety, depression, mood disorders, aggressive syndromes, and alcohol-related disorders.",

Ces symptomes negatifs ne repondent pas ou peu aux neuroleptiques classiques ; surtout ils sont susceptibles d'etre la consequence, non pas uniquement du processus schizophrenique en tant que tel (symptomes negatifs primaires), mais egalement de facteurs comme la depression, l'anxiete, l'akinesie induite par les neuroleptiques, la suspicion, etc. (symptomes negatifs secondaires) et peuvent, s'ils ne sont ainsi differencies, bouleverser l'interpretation des resultats de certaines etudes. C'est pour contourner ce probleme que carpenter et son equipe ont propose le concept de syndrome deficitaire de la schizophrenie qui specifie la presence, chez un patient schizophrene, de symptomes negatifs prononces, durables et primaires. Un instrument d'evaluation nomme schedule for the deficit syndrome (sds) a ete concu pour faire le diagnostic de ce syndrome ; nous en avons realise la version francaise validee. Les resultats des etudes conduites a partir de l'utilisation de cet instrument, differenciant les groupes deficitaire et non deficitaire parmi des patients schizophrenes, fournissent une base solide pour postuler que cette forme deficitaire de la schizophrenie constitue une maladie distincte avec une etiologie, des symptomes, une evolution et des correlations neurobiologiques differents de ceux trouves chez les patients presentant la forme non deficitaire. Nous avons, en particulier, etudie 2 parametres biochimiques dans le compartiment plasmatique (acide homovanillique ; hva et 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol ; mhpg) pour approcher les caracteristiques des systemes de neurotransmission dopaminergique et noradrenergique de chacune de ces formes de schizophrenie.",

      "title": "Sensitization to Drugs",
      "abstract": "The word “sensitization” is used to refer to a number of different but related effects. For example, in immunology, sensitization refers to the hypersensitivity to an antigen (often an allergen) that can develop upon repeated exposure to the antigen. In the study of learning, sensitization refers to a form of nonassociative learning whereby exposure to a stimulus (an unconditional stimulus, US) increases subsequent responsiveness to the same or other stimuli, even though they were not explicitly paired. Similarly, in pharmacology, the word sensitization has come to refer to an increase in a drug effect upon successive exposures to a drug or hypersensitivity to a drug in animals that were exposed to the drug in the past (Fig. 1). For example, one unconditional effect of drugs such as amphetamine or cocaine is to produce psychomotor activation, often measured as an increase in forward locomotion. Under some circumstances, the repeated administration of psychostimulant drugs results in a progressive increase in this drug effect, whereby successive injections of the same dose produce greater and greater psychomotor activation. Furthermore, exposure to one drug (e.g., amphetamine) can also render animals hypersensitive to the locomotor-activating effects of other drugs (e.g., cocaine or morphine). When exposure to one drug (or another stimulus, such as stress) renders an animal hypersensitive to another drug or stimulus, this is called “cross-sensitization” (Kalivas and Barnes 1988; Robinson and Becker 1986; Stewart and Badiani 1993).",

One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is sensory perception disorder, namely hallucinations which are typical of mental disorders in individuals characterized by changes in sensory perception, by feeling false sensations in the form of sounds (hearing), sight, taste, touch, or smell. Mental disorders are syndromes or patterns of behavior that are clinically significant that are associated with distress or suffering and pose obstacles to one or more functions of human life. One that includes mental disorders is schizophrenia. Hallucinations are false perceptual distortions that occur in maladaptive neurobiological responses, sufferers actually experience sensory distortions as real things and respond accordingly. Factors that can influence the recurrence of schizophrenic patients with hallucinations include high family emotional expressions, lack of family knowledge, availability of health services, family income and medication adherence in schizophrenic patients. psychiatric nursing care to Tn.

Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble.

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe principal routes of cocaine administration are oral, intranasal, intravenous, and inhalation.The slang terms for these routes are, respectively, \"chewing,\" \"snorting,\" \"mainlining,\" \"injecting,\" and \"smoking\" (including freebase and crack cocaine).Cocaine use ranges from occasional use to repeated or compulsive use, with a variety of patterns between these extremes.There is no safe way to use cocaine.Any route of administration can lead to absorption of toxic amounts of cocaine, allowing to acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular emergencies that could result in sudden death.Repeated cocaine use by any route of administration can produce addiction and other adverse health consequences.Those who snort or sniff cocaine through their noses suffer damage to their nasal and sinus passages.These include nasal crusting, nosebleeds, nasal congestion, irritation, facial pain caused by sinusitis and hoarseness.Cocaine addiction changes the responsiveness of the brain to various neurotransmitters or chemicals.The development of drug addiction involves persistent cellular and molecular changes in the Central Nervious System.The brain dopamine, GABA and glutamate systems play key roles in mediating drug-induced neuroadaptation.We show some physiological changes that can occur in some key pathways in which glutamate, dopamine and GABA receptors are involved.These chemical changes cause different effects in users, including: anxiety, confusion, dizziness, psychosis, headaches and nausea.Cocaine use and addiction affects the sympathetic nervous system (which controls automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat, etc.).This system secretes adrenaline which raises ones heart rate, narrows blood vessels and significantly increases blood pressure.Chest pain, heart attacks and strokes are common side effects of cocaine use.The most widely studied neurobiological characteristic of cocaine addiction is the role played by dopamine transmission.It is clear that enhanced dopamine transmission in neurons projecting from the ventral mesencephalon to the limbic forebrain, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), is the pharmacological target for cocaine-induced reinforcement and locomotor stimulation (O'Brien., 2001) However, persistence of the behavioral characteristics of cocaine addiction, such as paranoia (sensitization) and the propensity to relapse years after the acute rewarding effects of the drug have disappeared, indicates that there must also be neuronal substrates undergoing Addictions -From Pathophysiology to Treatment 104 long-term neuroplastic changes.Although studies have endeavored to identify enduring changes in dopamine transmission that might underlie behavioral sensitization and the reinstatement of drug-seeking (relapse), the results have not been entirely consistent with an obligatory role for dopamine.Addiction can be viewed as a form of drug-induced neural plasticity.One of the bestestablished molecular mechanisms of addiction is up-regulation of the cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse.This up-regulation and the resulting activation of the transcription factor CREB appear to mediate aspects of tolerance and dependence.In contrast, induction of another transcription factor, termed 1FosB, exerts the opposite effect and may contribute to sensitized responses to drug exposure.Knowledge of these mechanisms could lead to more effective treatments for addictive disorders.Cocaine Dopamine Tansporter (DAT) Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) Serotonine Transporter (SERT)",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem.Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits as dementia.Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM.In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglycemia have deleterious effect on the brain.Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits.Hypoglycemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus.Chronic hyperglycemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function.The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia related cognitive dysfunction include, macro-and micro-vascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycemia on the brain, advanced glycation end products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.Hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus.Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM.The knowledge that diagnosis at early age, frequency of hypoglycemia, poor glycemic control and presence of risk factors which negatively affect cognitive functions in DM, will have important implications for treatment and for research purposes.",

Ceux qui s'étaient entaillés le poignet étaient plus jeunes et leurs actes étaient d'une létalité plus faible. Ils sont peu susceptibles d'avoir déjà posé des gestes suicidaires. Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales. Plusieurs d'entre eux se plaignent de symptômes d'inappétence (anoxérie ou excès d'appétit ou encore des combinaisons de l'une et de l'autre), d'usage de la drogue ou d'abus de l'alcool; ils sont portés aux troubles sexuels, à l'angoisse, à la promiscuité. Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation. La réaction typique est la suivante: une fois la blessure infligée, et après une période de dépersonnalisation suivit de détente et de repersonnalisation provoquée par le saignement, le patient n'éprouve aucune douleur.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

There is also no single, uniformly well-tolerated drug that is reliably helpful. Current understanding of the etiology of neuropathic pain reveals seven potential targets for therapeutic intervention. These are: 1) ectopic activity in damaged peripheral nerves; 2) increased excitability in spinal dorsal horn neurons; 3) restoration or augmentation of GABAergic inhibition in the dorsal horn; 4) supraspinal and affective mechanisms; 5) alterations in the sympathetic nervous system; 6) spinal peptidergic mechanisms; and 7) spinal excitatory amino acid receptors. Current therapeutic approaches, using drugs such as gabapentin, anticonvulsants, ketamine or methadone, and potential new approaches are discussed in the context of these seven drug targets.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory.

The diagnostic classification system initially developed by the Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy (1989) reflects both the manner in which the seizure begins (partial versus generalized) and the effects of the abnormal discharge (see Table 8.1).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Common symptoms in life-limiting illness include pain, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, constipation, and dyspnoea. These may be due to disease or disease progression, treatment side effects, an intercurrent acute problem, or comorbidity. Patients with life-limiting illnesses often have multiple comorbidities and might be on many medications. Effective treatment always depends on making as precise a diagnosis as possible (e.g. pharmacological management of nausea and vomiting is guided by the presumed mechanism). Symptoms can also herald an emergency (e.g. sepsis, delirium, spinal cord compression), when the patient’s frailty, likely prognosis, and own values and wishes need to be taken into account in planning management. Individualized assessment and decision-making are vital.",

Some behaviors, for some people, can have similar effects on the same DA reward circuitry resulting in very similar addictive behavior patterns and consequences. Although the term \"addictive\" has been used loosely with many behaviors, it may be an appropriate term to describe compulsive shopping. Increased accessibility, hyperstimulating marketing techniques, a loss of the protective delay between impulse and purchase, and overvaluing of the shopping process and objects purchased may all contribute to the potentially addictive nature of shopping.",

Management is often difficult, with highly variable response to treatment. This classically includes oral benzodiazepines or steroids. New insights into pathophysiological mechanisms involved in sustaining epileptic activity or deficits in seizure termination may lead to improved management programs. Relevant synaptic processes implicate functional alterations of GABA, GABA and NMDA receptor complexes. Early results with NMDA blockers (e.g. ketamine) in animal models and pediatric patients are encouraging. Metabolic approaches have included ketogenic diets. Dynamic approaches of electroencephalographic signals may open the way to neuromodulation through electrical resetting techniques applied at critical phases.

Termination of home care and subsequent hospitalisation is caused largely by behavior disturbances and not cognitive deficits. Clinical efficacy of neuroleptic treatment seems to be modest and is limited by unwanted side effects. Carbamazepine shows psychotropic effects and seems to improve limbic pathology including aggression and poor impulse control in various psychiatric disorders. Treatment with carbamazepine was evaluated in an open study design in 29 gerontopsychiatric inpatients. Carbamazepine was efficient in treating agitated behavior disturbances in dementia and other disorders. Adverse effects of the drug showed up only in a small percentage of the patients and were reversible after discontinuation of the drug. The results suggest that carbamazepine may be effective in treating agitated behavior in gerontopsychiatric patients with different disorders. It may represent a sensible alternative or complementation to other therapeutic interventions.",

      "abstract": "For some time it has been known that total and partial sleep deprivation (in the second half of the night) produces an immediate antidepressive effect and a short-term effect of approximately 1-week duration. A 25-day trial is discussed here. 18 endogenous depressives who proved to be refractory to tricyclic antidepressive therapy were treated with periodic sleep deprivation (5 sleep deprivation treatments in the second half of the night at 5-day intervals) under continued drug therapy. The combined treatment led to a better result than would have been expected from drug therapy alone. Some of the sleep deprivation treatments effected an accelerated remission without the efficacy of treatment subsiding. In individual cases recovery occurred after one or a few partial sleep deprivation sessions. Whether in other respects sleep deprivation shortens the course of depressive phases is still unproven.",

      "abstract": "A atividade sexual satisfatória é um dos pilares da qualidade de vida, envolvendo das preliminares ao intercurso sexual, mecanismos neurológicos, vasculares, endocrinológicos, musculoesqueléticos, psicossociais, culturais, além do parceiro sexual e fatores individuais (autoestima, imagem corporal e habilidade pessoal). A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

      "abstract": "Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.",

      "title": "Psychiatric causes of behavioural change in adults less than 65 years old",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mr. Leow, aged 64 years, presents to the polyclinic with a memo from his nursing home stating 3 months of behavioural change. He was observed to have been cleaning his environment excessively, inexplicably even climbing onto the roof in the middle of the night to clean. His restlessness and the ruckus made by him disturb the other residents of the nursing home, and his nurses are finding it difficult to supervise him.WHAT IS ALTERED BEHAVIOUR? Altered mental state is a broad presenting complaint used to describe abnormal consciousness, cognition or behaviour.[1] In the older population, delirium, specifically a fluctuation in orientation and attention in an ill elderly person, is a main consideration. In the slightly younger adult population of less than 65 years of age, altered mentation can vary greatly in presentation, severity and underlying cause. Acute behavioural change is a subset of altered mental state and does not involve diminished consciousness or awareness.[1] There is no fixed definition. Instead, behavioural changes are usually reported deviations from the patient's baseline and behaviour generally accepted as appropriate according to cultural norms. These can be in the form of psychomotor agitation, changes in personality, bizarre actions, heightened or decreased energy and others.[2] Most represent either an organic or psychiatric condition, but all warrant expedient and thorough medical evaluation. There are wide-ranging organic and psychiatric aetiologies causing behavioural changes in adults (Appendix). For the purpose of this article, we will focus on common psychiatric conditions causing altered behaviour. HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? Patients with severe and acute changes in behaviour and mental states present more commonly to the emergency department or psychiatric services than primary care clinics.[2] Primary care physicians may encounter patients with subacute presentations or behaviour that is less disruptive to daily life. There is no data documenting the prevalence of behavioural changes presenting to the primary care clinic. There is, however, high prevalence but underrecognition of mental disorders presenting to primary care,[345] resulting in delayed diagnoses and a significant duration of possible untreated psychiatric disorder.[6] This is juxtaposed to the fact that primary care clinics remain the preferred setting patients with mental disorders first seek help from,[357] making it all the more necessary for family physicians to differentiate psychiatric conditions from organic causes. WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? History and examination As much as possible, corroborative history should be obtained.[8] Physicians often pick up valuable clues from patients' or, in this case, caregivers' observed accounts of the presenting complaint. In an otherwise broad and ill-defined presentation, contextual clues from the caregiver's accounts help to narrow differentials. A reliable third party's observations will also facilitate objective comparison between the patient's baseline and the current pathological behaviour.[9] Helpful questions include the following: What was the behavioural change observed? Was the onset sudden or gradual? Are there intermittent or fluctuating symptoms? Was there a precipitating event? What perpetuates the behaviour and what alleviates it? What has the progress been since? What was the patient's baseline mental state, behaviour, personality, cognition and function like? Severity can be assessed by the degree of disruption to the individual's function, in terms of activities of daily living, occupation and interpersonal relationships. Risk of self-harm and/or harm to others needs to be assessed to decide the need for emergent hospital or psychiatric facility admission. See Box 1 for the suggested criteria for referral to the emergency department.Box 1: Criteria for referral to emergency department.For all patients, a set of vital signs should be recorded and neurological and mental state examinations performed. Where there is suspicion, examination of appropriate systems based on pertinent history should be carried out, for instance, examination for bruising, cataracts, abdominal striae and supraclavicular fat pads for Cushing's syndrome in patients with history of exogenous steroid ingestion (see Appendix for the list of organic causes). Although not diagnostic by individual components and many organic conditions may result in similar mental status presentations, the mental state examination (MSE) offers invaluable clues to diagnosis[210] and completes the evaluation. See Figure 1 for the suggested algorithm for evaluation in a clinic. Primary care physicians ought to be familiar with the components of the MSE. For instance, a blunted affect, evidence of self-neglect, hallucinations or paranoia support diagnosis of psychosis, whether primary or secondary to organic causes.[11] Inattention may be present in substance abuse, mood disorders or schizophrenia. Observations of speech and behaviour are helpful – disorganised speech or paucity of speech occurs in psychotic conditions or depression, word-finding difficulty in dementia and pressured speech in mania or thyrotoxicosis.[10]Figure 1: Suggested algorithm for evaluation in clinic. ANA=anti-nuclear antibody, ED=emergency department, ESR=erythrocyte sedimentation rate, FBC=full blood count, HIV=human immunodeficiency virus, LFT=liver function test, TFT=thyroid function test, UFEME=urine full examination and microscopic examinationApproach Due to time constraints in the clinic setting, a concise and clear approach to evaluating the patient with behavioural changes is necessary. Clinicians may follow the algorithm below to decide on disposition. Patients who are clinically stable with manageable behaviour and who do not urgently require inpatient investigations can continue to be evaluated in the clinic. Basic blood tests ought to be performed before attempting to attribute the behavioural disturbance to psychiatric origins.[5912] Where there is clinical suspicion, tests for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, or antinuclear antibody and erythrocyte sedimentation rate for systemic lupus erythematosus can be performed.[8] WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? One should bear in mind that oftentimes, longitudinal follow-up and observation of the patient's progress over time is necessary for the diagnosis to be reached. Revisitation of the patient's presentation and further corroborative history may be needed to revise diagnoses as patient's symptomology evolves. When diagnoses are not clear-cut or when the initial treatment is ineffective, specialist consult should be sought. Psychiatric differentials See Table 1 for various psychiatric differentials and their featuresTable 1: Psychiatric differential diagnoses to changes in behaviour in adults less than 65 years old.Late-onset schizophrenia Although generally diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood, there is a significant proportion of patients, estimated to be 23.5% from one study,[3] whose symptoms of psychosis only present later in life, after 40 years of age. Patients with late-onset (defined as onset after 40 years of age) or very late-onset (defined as onset after 65 years of age) schizophrenia differ from their younger counterparts in that they have more positive than negative symptoms. Among positive symptoms, the prevalence of complex visual, tactile and olfactory hallucinations, paranoid, persecutory and partition delusions is higher than that of thought disorders and disorganisation.[11] These patients also tend to be female and have better premorbid function and prognosis.[1112] In primary care, there are often a myriad of non-specific prodromal symptoms that result in frequent primary care attendances many years before the diagnosis of psychosis is made, suggesting that there is room for earlier identification of at-risk individuals. These range from a variety of somatic complaints, mood-related symptoms and changes in behaviour, such as impaired personal grooming, social withdrawal and odd behaviour, to the more obvious changes in perception.[6] Psychotic symptoms are commonly associated with depression, anxiety, substance abuse[8] and other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, autoimmune conditions and chronic lung disease.[6] Very late-onset psychosis is further associated with sensory deficits such as vision or conductive hearing loss.[311] These comorbidities ought to be explored and treated where possible. Undiagnosed bipolar disorder Bipolar disorders are frequently missed or misdiagnosed as depression in primary care.[413] Depressive episodes are frequently the first presentation of bipolar disorder, with episodes of extroversion and increased energy unrecognised as manifestations of mania or hypomania. Certain behavioural changes can be subtle, such as frequent changes in jobs, legal trouble in the past or recurrent depression not responding to antidepressants.[13] With increasing prevalence of depression being managed in primary care[4] and the use of antidepressants as monotherapy being contraindicated in mania, every patient suspected to have depression should be screened for bipolar disorder. Frontotemporal dementia Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is another condition underrecognised in primary care, often resulting in significant delays in diagnosis. There are three variants of FTD: behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), semantic dementia and progressive non-affluent aphasia. Although distinct, all three conditions overlap in inappropriate behaviour, emotional blunting, loss of insight and relatively preserved memory and visuospatial ability. Behavioural changes in bvFTD occur insidiously over months with decline in social conduct, apathy, disinhibition and poor impulse control manifesting as unwanted sexual advances, hoarding, roaming and hyperorality.[14] As with other major neurocognitive disorders, there must be a deterioration in baseline function, whether interpersonal, occupational or daily function, for FTD to be diagnosed. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease, anti-cholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated in the treatment of bvFTD due to preserved cholinergic function[1415] and may, in fact, worsen the behaviour. N-methyl-d-aspartic acid antagonists show limited efficacy. Instead, treatment is usually targeted at relief of symptoms and management of behaviour. Take-Home Messages Patients with psychiatric conditions frequently present to primary care, either for prodromal symptoms long before their symptoms manifest or when their behavioural change becomes noticeable by caregivers. A high index of suspicion and thorough evaluation are needed to avoid missing the diagnosis. Corroborative history from a caregiver or family member is crucial in establishing the nature of the complaint, as it provides a reliable picture of the patient's baseline behaviour. Organic conditions, including drug causes, ought to be evaluated first in changes in behaviour before psychiatric diagnoses can be made. These may require extensive organic work-up, for which a referral to the emergency department for admission is indicated. Late-onset schizophrenia is an important diagnosis to consider, especially if there are complex hallucinations, delusions preceded by prodromal symptoms. Concomitant mood disorders, substance abuse, sensory loss and chronic medical conditions ought to be evaluated and treated in patients with possible psychosis. All patients presenting with depression ought to be also evaluated for bipolar disorder to prevent misdiagnosis and wrong treatment. FTD should be considered when there is a decline in cognitive function with apathy, poor impulse control or deterioration in interpersonal relationship. Closing Vignette Due to disruptive behaviour, Mr. Leow was eventually admitted to an acute hospital for work-up. He underwent toxicology studies, further blood tests, a lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. All tests were negative, except for uniform atrophy of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Further cognitive testing showed frontal lobe dysfunction and moderate cognitive impairment. With an impairment in judgement, impulsivity, lack of insight and an absence of hypomania features, Mr. Leow was eventually diagnosed with FTD. He was discharged after all investigations were complete, initiated on a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor and given outpatient specialist follow-up on his behaviour.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Similar to the adult patient, a child or adolescent may actively feign or produce artificial symptoms (synonymous: Munchausen syndrome). The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

A 26 year old-male,from Cabo Verde,is interviewed in the Emergency Department in June 2011 presenting disturbance of general behaviour.He is being aggressive and presents flight of ideas.The diagnosis: \"Hypomanic state\" treated with lorazepam 6 mg/day and Olanzapine 5 mg/day. August 2011, the patient is reevaluated because of his behaviour:soliloquies,laughs,expansive mood, abnormal irritability, easily excited to enthusiasm and irritable humor. He also presents psychomotor agitation associated to delusion of persecution.He has not been taking his medication. No other neurological symptoms are detected. In Hospital he receives Risperidone 6 mg/day, Clorazepate Dipotassium45mg/day and Lormetazepam 2 mg /day disappearing most of the symptoms. A MRI was done, presenting triventricular hydrocephalus with absence of intraparenchymal damage.After monitoring the intracranial pressure, Neurosurgery decides not to perform surgery. In the case of not responding to Risperidone, studies have been published that Aripiprazole (atypical antipsychotic with a unique partial agonistic effect at D2receptors)is effective and safe in the treatment of manic episode. Some publications about the reduction of D2receptors demonstrated that the binding of striatal was reduced in NPH. Sometimes imaging tests are needed in patients with behavioural disturbance as manic symptoms in order to avoid misdiagnosis and it is crucial for the correct medical and chirurgical treatment.",

      "title": "Autoimmune mediated suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "There is a known autoimmune disease, which is called ‘anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis’, or ‘Dalmau encephalitis’ (named after its discoverer). It is associated with the presence of high titers of antibodies to a certain epitope of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors in the blood and/or in the cerebrospinal fluid. This disease in its classic form is accompanied by severe mental (depression, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, catatonia, etc.) and neurological (convulsions, dyskinesias) symptoms, disturbances of consciousness and autonomic regulation (regulation of respiration, temperature, blood pressure, heart rhythm), as well as with suicidality, which seems to be disproportionate to the severity of mental disturbances. However, there are also ‘non-classical’ forms of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. These can manifest with exclusively psychiatric symptoms (for example, depression, psychosis, suicidal behavior), without characteristic neurological symptoms and/or disorders of autonomic regulation. In some of these cases, the correct diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was delayed by months, years or even decades. In addition, in recent decades, increasing evidence had accumulated that in some patients with so-called ‘classical’ mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive disorders – and especially in those who show resistance to traditional psychopharmacotherapy – elevated titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies can be detected in their blood and/or in their cerebrospinal fluid. It has also been shown that elevated blood titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies are often detected in post-mortem examinations of suicide victims. Anti-NMDA receptor antibody titers in psychiatric patients correlate well with a recent history of suicide attempts and/or with current active suicidal ideation. Some of these patients may benefit from aggressive immunosuppressive therapy that is similar to the regimens normally used to treat ‘classical’ anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with neurological and autonomic manifestations. This might stop their suicidal ideation and/or help in overcoming their resistance to psychopharmacotherapy. This article presents a description and analysis of three clinical cases of patients with various mental disorders, acute suicidality and elevated titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies, in whom such therapy has been effective.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a common and disabling condition; its lifetime prevalence in general population is estimated by several studies to 1-5%. There are data that prove the fact that patients with bipolar disorder show cognitive deficits in all stages of the disorder, but also during remission phases. Within bipolar disorder, bipolar depression occurs more frequently, lasts longer and has a higher rate of relapses than mania. Bipolar patients usually complain of cognitive deficits such as attentional or memory deficits Patients with bipolar disorder experiment during depressive episodes dysfunctions in attention (difficulties in focusing and maintaining attention), memory (deficits of declarative and nondeclarative memory, affected verbal recall and recognition), language (bradyphemia with longer moments of pause during speech), psychomotor performance (psychomotor inhibition, slowness of motor functions when the number of tasks increases), executive functions (limited ability to acquire or relearn different skills), general intellectual functioning (information processing deficits). Recent studies have made some suggestion regarding a certain degree of cognitive impairment that is also found in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. In order to have a more accurate assessment regarding the degree of cognitive dysfunctions both during depressive episodes and euthymic phases in bipolar disorder, diagnosis criteria for depression and for remission should be strictly respected and coexisting factors that may influence the results should not be taken in consideration.",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

      "title": "ECT: An Effective Treatment in the Screaming Demented Patient",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—As a tertiary inpatient geriatric psychiatry program, we are often exposed to a common treatment dilemma, the screaming demented patient. Very little has been published in this area. The studies reporting on agitation are mostly medical descriptions and pharmacologic trials, with verbal agitation being included under the broader symptom cluster of physical or behavioral agitation.1,2 Agitation is usually poorly defined, and in no studies was verbal agitation considered as a separate variable. As a whole, the medication trials achieved only limited degrees of success. Experience dictates that these successes are often more than offset by medication side-effects and drug toxicity, thus further complicating the patient's presentation and course.3 Partly owing to this lack of effective treatment, Fogel4 suggested the need for further investigation of ECT in the screaming demented patient. Verbal agitation (needless, unstimulated screaming, yelling, moaning) occurs in many psychiatric conditions common to the elderly—delirium, dementia and depression. It is unclear whether this is the result of a common final neurochemical pathway or of differing etiologies in the different conditions.5 We wish to report on a small series of three elderly, verbally agitated patients who showed a dramatic improvement in this symptom with bilateral ECT. In none of these patients was ECT the initial treatment modality employed; neuroleptics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines were tried unsuccsssfully first. One patient clearly met the criteria for major depression and had a past history of ECT-responsive mood disorder. In the other two patients, there was no clear history of major depression either past or current; both had a substantial degree of cognitive impairment. All three patients, exhibited rapid resolution of their screaming behaviour early in their course of ECT. These pilot results suggest some interesting directions. Assuming response to ECT, this might support the hypothesis that screaming in dementia may be a presentation of depression where the other symptoms may be difficult to elicit. On the other hand, the response may suggest a specific response to electrotherapy. Irrespective of the mechanism, ECT appears to provide the possibility of effective therapy in the demented patient who screams and could provide an alternative to the more traditional approach of endless trials of progressively more toxic psychotropic drugs, singly and in combination, with poor outcome and potentially devastating toxicity.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Bei der Alternativpsychose und der forcierten Normalisierung alternieren Perioden von epileptischen Anfällen bei normalem Verhalten mit Perioden von Anfallsfreiheit (oder wesentlicher Anfallsreduktion) mit gleichzeitigem Bestehen einer Psychose oder anderen psychischen Störungen. Anders als die klinisch definierte Alternativpsychose geht die forcierte Normalisierung vom EEG-Befund aus. In der klinischen Praxis und in der Literatur werden die beiden Begriffe meist synonym gebraucht und beschreiben auch die gleichen Krankheitsbilder. Dies erlaubte eine zusammenfassende Auswertung der Publikationen über Alternativpsychose und forcierte Normalisierung. Meist ist eine Alternativpsychose oder eine forcierte Normalisierung Folge der Anfallsunterdrückung durch Antiepileptika. In der Zeit der älteren Antiepileptika wurde eine Alternativpsychose bzw. eine forcierte Normalisierung vor allem bei der Behandlung von Absencen mit Succinimiden beobachtet. In der Ära der neuen Antiepileptika, die mit der Einführung von Vigabatrin begann, waren vor allem Patienten mit relativ pharmakoresistenten fokalen Epilepsien betroffen. 1987 - vor 31 Jahren - wurde erstmals über eine paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose bei Epilepsie durch die Behandlung mit Vigabatrin berichtet. Sukzessive folgten bis heute bei den meisten neuen Antiepileptika Berichte über eine Alternativpsychose bzw. eine forcierte Normalisierung. Eine umfassende Literatursuche ergab in diesem Zeitraum 66 Fälle mit detaillierten Angaben. Frauen waren mehr als doppelt so häufig betroffen wie Männer; der Grund ist nicht klar. In 4 retrospektiven Studien wurden weitere 176 alternative Ereignisse in pauschalerer Form mitgeteilt. Bei den wichtigeren neuen Antiepileptika scheint das Risiko einer Alternativpsychose oder einer forcierten Normalisierung bei Oxcarbazepin, Eslicarbazepin, Gabapentin und Pregabalin besonders gering zu sein.",

This article highlights the risk of clinically significant and sometimes severe psychological, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances that may be associated with glucocorticoid use, as well as ways to prevent and treat these disturbances. An illustrative case vignette is presented describing a patient’s experience of cycles of manic-like behavior and depression while on high-dosage prednisone, with long-term cognitive disorganization, vulnerability to stress, and personality changes. Severe neuropsychiatric consequences (including suicide, suicide attempt, psychosis, mania, depression, panic disorder, and delirium, confusion, or disorientation) have been reported to occur in 15.7 per 100 person-years at risk for all glucocorticoid courses, and 22.2 per 100 person-years at risk for first courses. The majority of patients experience less severe but distressing and possibly persistent changes in mood, cognition, memory, or behavior during glucocorticoid treatment or withdrawal. Although prediction of such effects is difficult, risks vary with age, gender, dosage, prior psychiatric history, and several biological markers. Key mechanisms thought to underlie these risk factors are briefly described. Recommendations are given for identifying individual risk factors and for monitoring and managing adverse neuropsychiatric effects of glucocorticoids.",

      "title": "[Medication-induced dysphagia : A review].",
      "abstract": "As a highly differentiated physiological process, swallowing may be affected by a variety of confounding factors. Primarily described are swallowing disorders caused by mechanical anatomic changes (e. g., alteration of the cervical spine, goiter), surgery for head and neck tumors, thyroid abnormalities, and neuromuscular disorders. Age-related cerebral neurological and blood vessel-associated changes can also cause dysphagia (so-called presbyphagia) or worsen the condition.Medication-associated dysphagia is recognized far less frequently, not paid due attention, or accepted in silence; particularly in older patients. Furthermore, pharmacological interference of different medications is frequently inadequately considered, particularly in the case of polypharmacy.Initial treatment of medication-induced dysphagia includes a critical review of medication status, with the aim of reducing/discontinuing the causative medication by giving precise instructions regarding its administration; as well as antacid medication, diet, and professional oral stimulation or swallowing training.To date, medication-induced dysphagia has not occupied the focus of physicians and therapists. This is despite the fact that many active agents can have a negative effect on swallowing and medication-induced dysphagia caused by polypharmacy is not uncommon, particularly in old age. This article presents an overview of the different classes of drugs in terms of their direct or indirect negative effects on the swallowing function.",

      "title": "Benzodiazepine Hypnotics and Insomnia",
      "abstract": "In summary, it is proposed that the more frequent or severe side effects associated with the newer triazolo-benzodiazepines are related to an interaction of several factors, including rapid elimination, high receptor-binding affinity, and unique chemical properties. Among benzodiazepine hypnotics, triazolam has a unique side effect profile for CNS adverse reactions in regard to type, frequency, and severity. All of the three factors mentioned contribute to this side effect profile: rapid elimination (the shortest half-life among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); high receptor-binding affinity (the highest among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); and unique chemical properties as a triazolo-benzodiazepine. Given these three factors, the drug's side effects can be understood as follows: Hyperexcitability states (daytime anxiety during drug administration and rebound insomnia following withdrawal) are related primarily to its rapid elimination and secondarily to the other two factors, whereas cognitive impairments (amnesia, confusion, and psychiatric symptoms) are related to the high binding affinity and unique chemical properties as well as to its rapid elimination. In contrast, benzodiazepines that are slowly eliminated and have only relatively moderate receptor-binding affinity (flurazepam) are unlikely to produce daytime anxiety and rebound insomnia and CNS adverse reactions such as cognitive impairment. The most common side effect, daytime sedation, is easily recognized and can be managed by dose reduction and/or intermittent use. This safety profile combined with the drug's high degree of efficacy both initially and with continued use provides a high benefit-risk ratio in using the drug in the adjunctive pharmacologic treatment of insomnia. Similarly, temazepam, which has relatively weak receptor-binding affinity produces very few CNS adverse reactions. Furthermore, temazepam (15 mg) is more efficacious than triazolam (0.25 mg). However, temazepam is not as effective as flurazepam, because it is slowly absorbed and therefore has limited efficacy for sleep induction. On the other hand, triazolam's safety profile of frequent and severe adverse reactions combined with the lack of efficacy for the current dose of 0.25 mg limits the drug's usefulness. In fact, the 0.25-mg dose has such a poor benefit-to-risk ratio that there is a real question as to whether the drug should remain on the market.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Evidentemente en la practica clinica es deseable modificar un estado de animo con el proposito de aliviar la ansiedad generalizada, la depresion o un trastorno obsesivo compulsivo, por citar solo algunos ejemplos. Uno de los grandes logros de la medicina moderna es haber desarrollado farmacos eficaces para el tratamiento de diversos trastornos de animo con lo cual la calidad de vida de un gran numero de personas se ha incrementado notablemente. Gracias a este avance trastornos que en el pasado eran incapacitantes y requerian hospitalizacion pueden ser tratados en consulta externa con muy buenos resultados. Esto ha sido posible por la investigacion clinica y cientifica que ha llevado al desarrollo de nuevas moleculas, de diversas formas farmaceuticas y de regimenes de dosificacion apropiados para el tratamiento de distintos trastornos. Dentro de las sustancias psicoactivas no solo se encuentran las medicinas que controlan los trastornos del estado de animo, del sueno o de la ansiedad, sino las drogas de abuso, llamadas asi por su alta capacidad para producir adiccion. La experiencia indica que hay que ser cauteloso con los compuestos que conforman esta categoria ya que su consumo conlleva el riesgo de perder el control sobre la cantidad ingerida, con las consecuencias negativas asociadas para el sujeto y la sociedad. ?En que consisten las diferencias entre las medicinas psicoactivas y las drogas de abuso? La respuesta a esta pregunta es compleja y requiere tener en cuenta que los efectos de los farmacos dependen no solo de sus mecanismos particulares de accion sino de las condiciones de las personas que los consumen, del regimen de dosificacion (cuanto y cuando se toma), de la forma farmaceutica (pastilla, tableta dispersable, jarabe, ampolleta para inyeccion, parche de liberacion prolongada, etc.) y de la via de administracion. Por eso, una misma sustancia puede ser muy util cuando se usa de manera controlada en un hospital y muy peligrosa cuando se vende en el mercado negro como droga.

      "abstract": "Refractory status epilepticus (RSE), defined as status epilepticus that fails to respond to the acute administration of two antiepileptic medications, occurs in approximately a third of patients with status epilepticus, and is associated with increased hospital length of stay, mortality, and functional disability. Common presentations include: (1) generalized convulsive status epilepticus or complex partial status epilepticus that continue despite initial therapies; (2) stupor or coma following a generalized convulsive or complex partial seizure; or (3) stupor or coma following brain surgery or acute brain injury. When status epilepticus continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the initiation of anesthetic therapy, or recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia, it is termed super RSE. Published evidence on optimal management of RSE consists largely of case reports or small series. The mainstay of treatment is the administration of anesthetic agents titrated to electrographic seizure control. Adjunctive therapies include hypothermia and immunosuppression and less commonly, surgery, electrical stimulation therapies, and induction of ketosis. Patients with cardiopulmonary complications and prolonged duration of drug-induced coma tend to have worse post-treatment functional outcomes. However, significant improvement over time can occur in survivors, and thus treatment is justified even in patients who require prolonged anesthetic coma. The strongest predictors of outcome are duration of anesthetic coma, etiology, and development of cardiopulmonary complications.",

Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar Affect Presenting as Hypomania",
      "abstract": "Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a behavioral syndrome associated with various neurological conditions that typically manifests as uncontrollable laughing or crying. PBA can significantly impact the quality of life of patients affected as these spells can be inappropriate to the social setting or incompatible with the patient's emotional state. The underlying mechanism of PBA appears to be associated with disinhibition in neuronal pathways involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. One hypothesis for the pathology of PBA is that it is the result of disruption of the corticopontine-cerebellar circuits, impairing cerebellar modulation of affect, and leading to uncontrolled emotional lability. Stroke, and other neurological disorders, interrupt these neuronal circuits causing disinhibition of the voluntary control of emotional expression. It is extremely important to recognize and appropriately diagnose the condition. We present a case report of an 85-year-old female patient who presented with a thalamic stroke, and she subsequently developed hypomania with symptoms of decreased need for sleep, mood lability, pressured speech, and religious preoccupation. This case discusses a unique presentation of PBA with hypomania.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

The most common of these are general somatic or gastrointestinal distress, anxiety and agitation, sleep disturbance, akathisia, parkinsonism, paradoxical behavioral activation and mania. There are very few reports of withdrawal reactions following discontinuation of clomipramine since it has not been in use in the US until recently. 2 patients with withdrawal symptoms following discontinuation of clomipramine are presented. A 45-year-old man had general somatic symptoms, including headache, myalgia, weakness, fatigue (flu-like syndrome) and nervousness and insomnia after clomipramine, 75 mg/d, had been discontinued abruptly. All symptoms disappeared without treatment after 3 days. A 47-year-old woman presented mainly with severe insomnia, anxiety, agitation, jitteriness and tension after discontinuing a low dose of 25 mg/d of clomipramine. Symptoms disappeared after she started self-treatment with 50 mg/d of the drug. It is important to differentiate withdrawal symptoms from relapse of the primary psychiatric disorder.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

The reason of this phenomenon can be explained by age-related change in sleepwake regulation, comorbid diseases and psycho-social status. Benzodiazepine derivatives and benzodiazepine agonists have been widely used for treatment of insomnia. These GABA-A receptor agonist hypnotics have sedative effect, possibly causing various adverse events, i.e. falls and hip fracture, anterograde amnesia, next morning hangover especially in the elderly. When making a choice of treatment drugs for the elderly, low dose benzodiazepine hypnotics with relatively high Ω1-selectivity, and newer hypnotics including melatonic receptor agonist or orexin receptor antagonist can become important candidates considering their comorbid diseases or drug interaction with other medications.",

      "title": "Case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency mimicking major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder. The patient gave the authors informed consent to publish this letter.",

      "title": "Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process. Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapies are available for persons with FTNCD at this time. Symptomatic management attempts to control disease manifestations alone, and it is the only approach to FTNCD currently available.",

Dentro de las adicciones comportamentales se incluyen ludopatía, Internet y nuevas tecnologías, adicción a la comida, las compras y/o el sexo entre otras1 . Se considera la impulsividad un predictor de la adicción2 , en la impulsividad existe urgencia motivada por un estado de tensión que conduce a la acción derivada del estrés o ansiedad y la acción conduce a la relajación3 denominada compulsión, y podría constituir un eslabón en la cadena del desarrollo del comportamiento adictivo4 . Por ello un programa de intervención de enfermería para trastorno obsesivo compulsivo (TOC) y adicciones comportamentales podría ser útil para el tratamiento de ambas patologías5 . Objetivos: ❖ Aumentar la motivación al cambio y eficacia percibida en relación a conductas de riesgo. ❖ Reducir sintomatología clínica y mantener resultados en el tiempo. ❖ Ampliar recursos personales y familiares para mejorar funcionamiento psico-socio- laboral de la persona. Material y métodos: Se realizará una evaluación pre-tratamiento, una monitorización del tratamiento, evaluación post-tratamiento inicial y a los 6 meses6 . El tratamiento consistirá en una intervención enfermera de salud mental dividida en módulos: A. Conceptos básicos sobre adicción B. Asertividad y respuesta social. Habilidades sociales. C. Gestión de la ansiedad: relajación y mindfulness D. Educación para la salud: higiene, alimentación y descanso. E. Psicoeducación familiar.

After the 1960s, it was revealed that other conditions can also cause catatonia.2 Gelenberg (1976) said there could be more than 40 cases that could cause catatonia and many new ones have emerged since then.3 Previous data suggest that catatonia is more common in mood disorders than in schizophrenia. The other causes of catatonia can be due to medical causes like endocrine disorders, infections, electrolyte imbalance, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. An excessive dosage of drugs or substances like cocaine, ecstasy, disulfiram, and levetiracetam can also result in catatonia.4,5",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 3rd Edition, 1988, defines impairment as \"the loss of use of, or derangement of any body part, system or function.\" Headaches may be classified under episodic neurological disorders and impairment based loosely on frequency, severity and duration of attacks and how activities of daily living are affected. Other systems base ratings by physical findings or diagnosis. Criteria for posttraumatic headache are proposed in the form of a mnemonic: IMPAIRMENT. Intensity, Medication use, Physical signs/symptoms, Adjustment, Incapacitation, Recreation, Miscellaneous activity of daily living, Employment, Number (frequency), Time (duration of attacks). Each are scored from 0 to 2 points. There are three physician modifiers, scored from 0 to -4 points: Motivation for treatment, Overexaggeration or overconcern, Degree of legal interest. Case examples will illustrate how impairment ratings are determined, along with further details on scoring. Proposed criteria for posttraumatic headache impairment are understandable, easy to utilize and reproducible.",

      "abstract": "During episodes of depression, patients exhibit a low mood and a number of other emotional and/or physical symptoms for a certain period of time. Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Dissociation is a ubiquitous clinical phenomenon. Dissociative disorders (DD) are primarily characterized by dissociation, and dissociative states are also a criterion for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociative reactions such as depersonalization/derealization and amnesia (e.g., gaps in awareness/memory) across diagnostic categories are believed to be affect contingent and theorized to serve affect regulation functions. What is not clear, however, is how self-reported affect and physiological reactivity unfold within dissociative episodes. To address this issue, the present project aims to investigate the hypothesis (1) whether self-reported distress (as indicated by arousal, e.g., feeling tense/agitated, and/or valence, e.g., feeling discontent/unwell) and physiological reactivity increase before dissociative episodes and (2) whether self-reported distress and physiological reactivity decrease during and after dissociative episodes in a transdiagnostic sample of patients with DD, BPD, and/or PTSD. Methods and analyses: We will use a smartphone application to assess affect and dissociation 12 times per day over the course of one week in everyday life. During this time, heart and respiratory rates will be remotely monitored. Afterwards, participants will report affect and dissociative states eight times in the laboratory before, during, and after the Trier Social Stress Test. During the laboratory task, we will continuously record heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory rate, as well as measure blood pressure and take salivary samples to determine cortisol levels. Our hypotheses will be tested using multilevel structural equation models. Power analyses determined a sample size of 85.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Excessive daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic-hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and cataplexy are symptoms associated with narcolepsy. It is not uncommon to occur co-morbidly between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders. This association is poorly understood. Recent findings indicate that anxiety disorders also are associated with typical symptoms of narcolepsy. Objectives Study of the comorbidity between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders, like anxiety, through a clinical case. Methods A 21-year-old female patient with no psychiatric history who consulted due to anxiety and panic attacks related to poor narcolepsy control. Debut of the neurological disease during adolescence with frequent cataplexy attacks that condition their daily activity and generate avoidance behaviors and agoraphobia. Results The patient complained of poor quality of sleep and reported a large number of different types of situations (eg, surprise, embarrassment) associated with cataplectic events. Treatment with SSRIs first and bupropion with pregabalin later was partially effective. Recent studies suggest efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation. Conclusions Anxiety disorders, especially panic attacks and social phobias, often affect patients with narcolepsy. Anxiety and mood symptoms could be secondary complications of the chronic symptoms of narcolepsy. Recent studies have shown that narcolepsy is caused by defective hypocretin signaling. As hypocretin neurotransmission is also involved in stress regulation and addiction, this raises the possibility that mood and anxiety symptoms are primary disease phenomena in narcolepsy. Recent studies suggest that vagus nerve stimulation could be potentially useful in the treatment of resistant depressive and anxiety disorder and it is not a contraindication in patients with narcolepsy.

      "abstract": "This perspective presents a new comprehensive proposal for sleep bruxism management. Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment within episodic-autobiographical domain, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage on conventional structural brain imaging. Objectives This work’s objectives are establishing greater recognition of possible relations between memory performance and social cognition in patients with dissociative amnesia. Aims We review data on social cognition (affective and cognitive theory of mind, simulation, empathy, social judgment, moral judgment) from our own patients with dissociative amnesia. Methods Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically and with neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. Results Patients with dissociative amnesia show variable degrees of impairments of components of social cognition, based on their comorbid conditions (e.g. concurrent clinical or subclinical depression), types of memory impairments (e.g. extent of retrograde amnesia, presence of autobiographical semantic deficits), pattern of brain metabolic changes, personality characteristics, neuropsychological profile (performance on executive functions or emotional processing) and testing paradigms. Conclusions The impairment in dissociative amnesia seems to go beyond the conscious mnemonic deficit, encompassing various aspects of social information processing. Knowledge about the pattern of metabolic and micro-structural brain changes in patients with dissociative amnesia as well as a fine-grained analysis of the neural correlates of various aspects of social cognition might provide an understanding of when and how episodic-autobiographical memory contributes to social cognition. As several studies emphasized, some structures involved in mnemonic processing may also play a role in social perception, cognition and behavioural regulation, including future-minded choice behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Patients with cancer typically experience multiple symptoms related to cancer and cancer treatment. These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3). Undertreatment of symptoms has become a major health problem in its own right.",

Brain gymnastics is a simple body movement exercise that is done to stimulate the left and right brain (lateral dementia), lighten or relax the front or back of the brain (focusing dementia), and stimulate the system related to feelings or emotions, namely the midbrain (limbic) and cerebrum (central dementia). Research Method: namely using experimental methods, interviews/anamnesis, physical examination and supporting examinations. Results: After the intervention was carried out for 3 days, there was an increase in cognitive function. Conclusion: Brain Gym can improve cognitive function in the elderly.",

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Computational and Evidence-based Medicine in Neuromodulation Christopher Butson1, 2*, Brian H. Kopell2, K Driesslein1 and S Jain1 1 Medical College of Wisconsin, Department of Neurology, United States 2 Medical College of Wisconsin, Department of Neurosurgery, United States Background/Aims Cortical stimulation (CS) has been used diagnostically as a mapping tool prior to surgery, as well as therapeutically as a chronic treatment for a variety of disorders including epilepsy, depression, tinnitus, pain and other conditions. Therapeutic CS is delivered through a chronically implanted system that is composed of an implantable pulse generator (IPG) and one or more stimulating electrodes. After surgical implantation the IPG must be programmed with a stimulation protocol that provides good therapeutic response with minimal side effects. The fundamental principle behind this approach is that current injected through epidural or subdural electrodes impinges on nearby anatomical areas, which leads to a functional response. For example, during CS for treatment of chronic pain the objective is to provide symptomatic relief without any stimulation-induced side effects such as muscle twitches, speech arrest or changes in cognitive/sensory state. However, the therapeutic effectiveness of this approach is quite variable, and few tools have been available to quantify the interactions between the stimulation system and the surrounding tissue. Therefore, the first step to understanding the effects of CS is to determine how much current is entering the cortical tissue, where this is occurring and how these two factors are affected by the stimulation protocol. Methods/Statistics We used patient-specific, multi-scale computational models to quantify the interaction between the stimulation system and the brain tissue. Finite element models of cortex were constructed from pre-operative MRI for anatomical segmentation and post-operative CT for electrode localization. Conductivities were assigned for the brain tissue, dura, electrodes and insulating material, and boundary conditions were applied based on the stimulation protocol. The system was solved to determine the voltage in the tissue medium, which was subsequently applied to pyramidal cell neuron models which fired spontaneously. Hence, the model system allowed us to examine the modulatory effects of stimulation, which could include excitation or inhibition, on an individual cell basis as a function of the electrode location and stimulation protocol (current amplitude, pulse width, frequency and configuration of anodes and cathodes). Finally, we combined model outcomes with clinical measures of CS effectiveness for tinnitus to identify cortical regions where stimulation provided the best therapeutic response with minimal side effects. Results We observed complex interactions between the stimulation protocol, the location of the electrodes and the detailed morphology of the brain: (i) The amount of current entering the cortical tissue was strongly dependent on the thickness of the dura under the electrode, as well as the position of the electrode with regard to the sulcal/gyral pattern. (ii) The voltage distribution in the cortical tissue was strongly dependent on the configuration of anodes and cathodes (e.g. monopolar, bipolar or multiple anodes/cathodes). (iii) The modulatory effects of CS were a function of the stimulation protocol and the amount of current entering the cortical tissue (as opposed to current that was shunted away by dura or cerebrospinal fluid). (iv) In a cohort of 8 patients receiving CS for tinnitus, we observed that both anodic or cathodic stimulation could provide good therapeutic response as long as the areas of strongest modulation were well aligned with target cortical regions identified via fMRI. In addition, we observed that the effects of stimulation were not immediate: average time for onset was about 4 weeks, and average time for offset was about 2 weeks. Conclusion/Summary In this study we demonstrate how patient-specific computational models can be combined with clinical outcome measures to facilitate evidence-based decision making in neuromodulation. With this approach we were able to compare the modulatory effects of CS in areas of effective versus ineffective stimulation. This approach facilitates comparison across all patients via an atlas brain.

      "title": "Interventions for the Prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Sudden Unexplained Death in Infancy: A Review of Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under the age of one (i.e., death for which a cause is not found even after a thorough investigation including review of clinical history, examination of death scene and a complete autopsy). Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) also known as Sudden unexplained infant death is a term used to describe sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant for which external risk factors may be present. SUDI is a blanket term that encompasses SIDS, other unexplained infant deaths, and explained infant suffocations. SIDS and SUDI are not diagnoses. Risk factors for SIDS fall under three groups: intrinsic risk factors (e.g., male sex, prematurity, exposure to cigarette smoke), extrinsic risk factors (e.g., prone or side sleep position, bed sharing, overheating) and exogenous factors (e.g., ethnicity, climate, geographical location). It has been shown that racial and ethnic disparities (such as Indigenous peoples and other racial minorities) and vulnerabilities (such as low socioeconomic status, fewer social supports, those experiencing problems with housing, violence or mental illness) may contribute to increased risk of SIDS.,In Canada, the incidence of SUDI was the highest in 1980 with a rate of 2.07 SUDI per 1,000 live births. The rates of SUDI and SIDS have since decreased, especially since the 1990s. In 2018, there were ten deaths classified as SIDS in Canada. A global decrease in the incidence of SIDS can be attributed to widespread “Back-to-Sleep” campaigns, which were aimed to promote placing babies in a supine position for sleeping., Several similar risk reduction strategies, primarily focused on sleep position, have been implemented globally with the aim of reducing the incidence of SIDS and SUDI., The “Back-to-sleep” campaign was later expanded to the “Safe-to-sleep” campaign in 2012 to involve new and evolved evidence for preventing SIDS. As a result of continued research, guidelines regarding the prevention of SIDS and SUDI have been developed and updated throughout the last three decades.A previous CADTH Summary of Abstracts report, published in 2016, briefly summarized evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of SIDS. The purpose of this report is to summarize and critically appraise evidence-based guidelines that were published within the last five years regarding interventions for the prevention of SIDS or SUDI.",

Conclusions It is particularly difficult to make the differential diagnosis with malignant catatonia, by the common features that both products, which are indistinguishable in a quarter of cases, conceptualise the NMS as a form of drug-induced malignant catatonia. This resembles by muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and akinesia. His appearance is preceded by emotional disorders, psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, impaired functioning prior patient, acute anxiety and agitation, which occurs about two weeks before.

      "abstract": "Myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE) belongs to the group of epilepsies with primarily generalized seizures as absence epilepsies, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, as well as infantile and juvenile idiopathic epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

Contributing factors resulting in homicide may have included increased seizure frequency associated with a change in his AED regimen seizure frequency. The AED change to levetiracetam may also have increased impulsiveness with diminished mood regulation following discontinuation of carbamazepine. There is evidence that he had a cluster of seizures immediately prior to the murder which may have resulted in the postictal disinhibition of frontal lobe inhibitory systems.

      "abstract": "A very rare case is presented, when anxious sexual failure expectation syndrome in a male patient was manifested mostly in the form of a fear of libido decrease, the above fear being the real cause for that decrease. The fear appeared after one moment, when the patient noticed libido reduction. Some time later after that decrease he developed thoughts about a possible disturbance of erection, but the latter remained normal though it was not «swelling» like before the libido decrease (preclinical level). The author describes treatment of this patient with help of some psychotherapeutic methods: different cognitive techniques including the author’s method of «comparison by analogy», hypnosuggestive therapy in the variant of programming (using in particular the author’s formula of suggestions for increasing libido), the author’s modification of the «sway» technique that belongs to neurolinguistics programming. Pharmaceutical treatment (Hydazepamum, Trittico) was used too. During the treatment the patient developed a fear of becoming a homosexual, because his desire for women was reduced. It served as the cause for using cognitive manipulations and hypnosuggestive therapy as well as the above pharmacotherapy. The given treatment resulted in recovery. The above clinical observation demonstrates that in extraordinarily rare cases the libido decrease, which has already happened, can later lead to development of a fear of this decrease, this fear causing reduction of libido due to functioning of the semantic mechanism: what the patient is afraid of is realized.",

This predisposition to affective episodes, rather than the episodes themselves (which can have many causes), is arguably the hallmark of bipolar disorder. Most episodes of bipolar disorder, including the first episode, are depressive. This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Treatment of a depressive episode in undiagnosed bipolar disorder can entail the use of medications that were developed to treat a different disorder (major depressive illness) and that may have mood-destabilizing or activating properties.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of Non rapid eye movement (Non-REM) sleep. Non-REM parasomnia behaviors have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream-like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterize the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental disconnection associated with behavioral episodes, 35 adult patients with Non-REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in-depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviors (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterized by delusional thinking of varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni- or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%) and variable, but often pronounced amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (‘awake dreaming’). Surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people) or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness and sensory disconnection in Non-REM parasomnias is variable and graded. In their full-fledged expression, Non-REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep-related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "abstract": "Apathy is a quantitive reduction of goal-directed activity either in behavioural, cognitive, emotional or social dimension in comparison to the person’s previous level of functioning in these areas. Apathy is prevalent across many neurodegenerative, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. It represents the most common behavioural and psychological symptom in people with Alzheimer’s Disease and is often observed in Parkinson’s disease, vascular dementia, stroke, traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, major depression, and schizophrenia. However, the definition and terminology employed to refer to apathy can vary in the context of different conditions and specialities and the diagnostic criteria have evolved. Additionally, the term apathy is employed to describe both a symptom and a syndrome. Indeed, little progress has been achieved in assessing the validity of the same construct across different disorders (eg. neurodegenerative disorders, schizophrenia or affective disorders). In 2018, a new version of the diagnostic criteria for apathy (DCA) in neuropsychiatric disorders was published. The validity of this new consensus has yet to be assessed among all relevant populations, including schizophrenia. Six European centres (Naples, Geneve, Nice, Rennes, Barcelona, Cambridge) aimed to test the prevalence of apathy, measured with the 2018 DCA, in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. As a second aim, we focused on the relationship between DCA and other measures of apathy and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (BNSS and PANSS). In this talk, we will compare the preliminary findings of this pan-European study in schizophrenia patients with previous studies on neurodegenerative disorders.

Epidemiology PrevalenceThe prevalence of delirium varies with the population that is being studied (Fong et al., 2009).Delirium is a relatively common disorder, especially in older people with physical illness (Saxena & Lawley, 2009).Community rates of delirium are reported to vary from 0.4% to 2% (Saxena & Lawley, 2009, Fong et al., 2009).In general hospital setting prevalence of delirium has been reported to range from 11% to 33% on admission (Lindesay et al.,",

Treatment was well tolerated and the side effects, consisting mainly of nausea or symptoms related with the nervous system, such as anxiety, depression, confusion or drowsiness, were mild or moderate in most cases and rarely led to the patient's giving up the treatment. The drug has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, with little potential to interact with other pharmaceuticals. It seems to have a synergic effect with modafinil, boosting its effects in the treatment of excessive sleepiness. Although it is a substance that has been used as a recreational drug, no cases of addiction or drug abuse have been observed in narcoleptic patients treated in a controlled manner.Sodium oxybate can be considered to be a first-choice drug in the treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy.",

      "title": "Case Scenario: Opioid Association with Serotonin Syndrome",
      "abstract": "CHRONIC pain is a complex and subjective experience reflecting interactions of sensory, affective, cognitive, behavioral, and social factors.1The complexity of chronic pain necessitates multidimensional therapies; however, complex analgesic regimens pose risks for adverse drug interactions.1Analgesic regimens frequently include different classes of analgesics: nonopioids (acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents), opioids, and/or adjuvants (antidepressants, anticonvulsants, etc. ). Effective and streamlined management of chronic pain is further confounded by associated comorbidities,2especially depression, which is present in more than 60% of chronic pain patients.1,2Medications modulating serotonergic pathways, such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. , amitriptyline, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, e.g. , fluoxetine, citalopram), or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. , duloxetine, venlafaxine) are frequently used in the treatment of depression.2,3As a result, it is common for patients with chronic pain to be prescribed opioid analgesics along with antidepressant medications either for the analgesic and/or antidepressant effect.3Less common is the awareness that opioids may significantly affect serotonin kinetics in the presence of other serotonergic agents, causing increased intrasynaptic serotonin level.4The following case scenarios illustrate the concern of potential iatrogenic adverse interactions of serotonergic drugs with commonly prescribed opioids in chronic pain patients.SA was a 45-yr-old male with long-standing abdominal pain attributed to Crohn's disease, as well as low back and neck pain with associated insomnia and depression. For several years he maintained a stable regimen of 30 mg oral methadone three times a day, 60 mg duloxetine once a day, and 10 mg desipramine at bedtime.He presented to the pain clinic for an unscheduled follow-up per his request, with new complaints of increased tremulousness, fatigue, and weakness in the bilateral upper and lower extremities. He also reported worsening insomnia and anxiety over the past week. On history, he admitted to taking more than his prescribed dose of methadone during the last 2 weeks for acute, severe renal colic pain secondary to nephrolithiasis.On exam, SA was hypertensive, diaphoretic, and tremulous, and had stiff extremities with passive range of motion without clonus, as well as 3+ patella reflexes. This constellation of symptoms along with his history met the diagnostic criteria for serotonin syndrome. Subsequently, he was instructed to discontinue duloxetine and reduce his methadone to his prescribed dose. The low-dose desipramine was continued, as it had been effective in managing insomnia. Over the following 2 days, his symptoms resolved.RB was a 58-yr-old male with a long history of back pain following vertebral fractures sustained in a motor vehicle accident 40 yr ago. History revealed long-term stable doses of medications for management of his pain and depression. These included 75 μg per hour transdermal fentanyl patch replaced every 3 days, 5/325 mg oral oxycodone/acetaminophen twice daily, 200 mg celecoxib twice daily for pain, and 40 mg citalopram once daily and 50 mg mirtazapine at bedtime for depression. In addition, he was prescribed 4 mg doxazosin for benign prostatic hypertrophy and 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release at bedtime as needed for insomnia.Due to his complaint of inadequate pain control, RB's frequency for replacement of fentanyl patch was increased to 2 days rather than 3 days by his managing physician. A week after the increase in fentanyl, he developed anxiety, tremulousness, fever, and sweating. He was prescribed 0.2 mg oral clonidine every 4 h for management of anxiety, but this did not improve his symptoms by the next day. RB then decided to discontinue his fentanyl patch without informing his prescribing physician, as he believed the recent increase was the cause of his new symptoms.With persisting symptoms, RB presented to the emergency department the next day and was found to be hypertensive, tachycardic with heart rate in the low 100s, tachypneic with respiratory rate in the 20s, anxious, unable to stand still, and mildly confused. Laboratory, electrocardiogram, and drug screen were unremarkable. RB was treated with 5 mg haloperidol and 2 mg lorazepam for agitation and anxiety and discharged home (table 1).Continuing to have persistent symptoms, he returned to the emergency department later that night with new complaints of frequent yawning and insomnia. The emergency department physician suspected opioid withdrawal, given a negative urine drug screen for opiate metabolites. However, RB claimed that he took his oxycodone as prescribed. He was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of opioid withdrawal, so his fentanyl patch, which he removed 2 days prior, was reapplied. The admitting team then consulted the pain service for further management (table 1).Further questioning by the pain service revealed that RB had a similar, although less intense, presentation of symptoms shortly after initiating oxycodone. With regard to his current symptoms, an increase in replacement frequency of his fentanyl patch was the only recent change in his medication regimen. Based on current and past symptoms being preceded by opioid medication changes in the setting of other agents affecting the serotonin pathways, the pain service diagnosed RB with serotonin syndrome. Increased fentanyl was thought to be the precipitating factor, even though he had been without his fentanyl patch for 30 h, since peripheral stores of fentanyl are cleared slowly after discontinuation of a transcutaneous patch. After making the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome, haloperidol, fentanyl patch, oxycodone/acetaminophen, citalopram, and mirtazapine were discontinued. RB had complete resolution of symptoms by the following day. For chronic pain, he was prescribed 45 mg extended-release oral morphine sulfate every 12 hours in place of the fentanyl patch, with reported good pain control and no recurrence of earlier symptoms on follow up. Since his depression had been stable on citalopram and mirtazapine before the recent increase in fentanyl, RB was discharged from the hospital with instructions to restart these antidepressants (table 1).Both of these cases highlight the limitations/complexities in the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. They expose the consequences of polypharmacy and limited knowledge of the interactions among prescribed medications. The lack of awareness among clinical practitioners led to a misdiagnosis/missed diagnosis on two occasions in case two. Mild symptoms, overlapping features between several syndromes, and limitations of clinical diagnostic criteria for serotonin syndrome are also other confounding factors in missed diagnosis. These two cases affirm that upon early and accurate diagnosis, discontinuation of suspicious offending agents leads to resolution of symptoms within 24 h.The symptoms of serotonin syndrome have a direct correlation with intrasynaptic serotonin level. Hence, choice of nonserotonergic medications, dose reduction, and discontinuation of the serotonergic agents will prevent recurrence of serotonin syndrome. In case one, decreasing the dose of methadone, and in case two, replacement of serotonergic opioids (oxycodone and fentanyl) by a nonserotonergic opioid (morphine) despite continuation of the other serotonergic agents (desipramine, mirtazapine), was helpful in managing the other symptoms. In both cases the serotonergic symptoms subsided shortly after these adjustments were made with no recurrence.Serotonin syndrome is a rare, but potentially life-threatening, iatrogenic complication4,6from therapeutic use or overdosage of serotonergic drugs alone or in combination via postsynaptic hyperstimulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A and 1A serotonin receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system.6Serotonin syndrome presents as a constellation of symptoms including mental status changes, neuromuscular over-activity, and autonomic instability.6,7Serotonin syndrome was first described in the1950s as a drug interaction of iproniazid with pethidine, and it was soon discovered thereafter that serotonin excess was the causative factor.4,8The true incidence is likely underestimated because of unrecognized milder symptoms and overlapping symptoms with other diseases, making the diagnosis challenging.9,10,11The incidence of serotonin syndrome is reported to be 14–16% in patients who overdose with SSRIs alone.12However, the incidence of serotonin syndrome has been on the rise in the past 20 yr due to development of diagnostic criteria, wide usage of SSRIs, emergence of newer SSRIs, and polypharmacy.1,13Symptoms manifest predictably, with rising intrasynaptic serotonin concentration ranging from mild tremors and diarrhea to severe toxic symptoms such as hyperthermia and rigidity. Intentional misuse, overdosing, or concomitant use of multiple serotonergic drugs in therapeutic dosages may result in serotonin syndrome. Occasionally, monotherapy may also precipitate symptoms,12but most severe reactions are attributed to polypharmacy.Serotonin is an essential neurotransmitter found in the central nervous system at the brainstem raphe nuclei and in the periphery within intestinal enterochromaffin cells and platelets.7It is generated by hydroxylation and decarboxylation of L-tryptophan.14Serotonin cannot cross the blood brain barrier but its precursor metabolites can.10,15Serotonin mediates excitatory neurotransmission through its action on the family of G protein-coupled/ligand-gated ion channel serotonin receptors, i.e. , 5-HT receptors.11,12There are seven main types of serotonin receptor (5-HT1to 5-HT7) with several subtypes described.14Centrally serotonin regulates wakefulness, affective behavior, core temperature, vomiting, eating behavior, and sexual behavior, and mediates nociception/analgesia. Peripherally, it modulates gastrointestinal motility and vasomotor function.7,12After serotonin release, postsynaptic vesicles reuptake serotonin and metabolize it to 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid via monoamine oxidase enzymatic action.14Pathophysiology of serotonin syndrome is complex. Excessive postsynaptic agonism of serotonergic receptors through increased intrasynaptic serotonin level or direct receptor stimulation resulting in increased postsynaptic excitatory neurotransmission at 5-HT2Aand 5-HT1Areceptors is responsible for the development of serotonin syndrome16(fig. 1). Intrasynaptic serotonin excess can result from its increased synthesis or release, as well as decreased reuptake or decreased metabolism.12,16There is an expanding list of agents through various mechanisms having potential to cause serotonin syndrome, as mentioned in figure 1. In addition to excessive 5-HT2Aand 5-HT1Apostsynaptic agonism,16there are several other factors predisposing serotonin syndrome, including: Despite a limited-yet-growing armamentarium of medications to treat pain conditions, opioids remain a mainstay of pain management. Opioids are commonly used analgesics prescribed in conjunction with other serotonergic medications, thus affecting the pharmacodyanamics of serotonin. In recent years, opioids have been recognized as serotonergic agents that have been associated with serotonin syndrome.4Proposed mechanisms for opioids' serotonergic action include both a weak serotonin reuptake inhibition6and an increased release of intrasynaptic serotonin through inhibition of γ-amino butyric acid-ergic presynaptic inhibitory neuron on serotonin neurons.3,10Synthetic piperidine opioids are considered proserotonergic and include fentanyl,17methadone,18meperidine,19propoxyphene, dextromethorphan,20and tramadol.21The phenantherene morphine analogues, i.e. , oxycodone,22hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and buprenorphine23do not act as serotonin uptake inhibitors,24but may increase the intrasynaptic serotonin levels either through increased release of neurotransmitter or some unknown mechanism.4,6,14The list of opioids implicated in causing serotonin syndrome with other serotonergic agents is growing (table 2).Oxycodone is a centrally acting synthetic morphine analog acting on μ and κ receptors to provide analgesia. It lacks serotonin uptake inhibition property24but may cause increased serotonin-like activity at the synaptic level by direct action on postsynaptic membranes mimicking serotonin activity, or may release serotonin through an unknown opioid-mediated release.24There are several case reports published in recent years showing synergism with other serotonergic agents to precipitate serotonin syndrome.Fentanyl is a synthetic phenylpiperidine opioid that binds with μ receptors to provide analgesia. It is a 5-HT1Aagonist, which augments serotonin release, and through weak serotonin reuptake inhibition, increases intrasynaptic serotonin levels.4There is no report of fentanyl causing serotonin syndrome as a sole agent; rather, it requires the additive action of other serotonergic agents or use in combination with SSRIs.14In our second case, RB had an imbalance of serotonin precipitated by an increase in fentanyl patch dosing.Methadone, a synthetic piperidine opioid, is a racemic mixture of R/S methadone enantiomers. It exerts its analgesia through opioid receptor agonism by R enantiomer and N -methyl-D -aspartate antagonism by S enantiomer.14It is metabolized by hepatic enzymes and is a CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor, which indirectly inhibits metabolism of tramadol to its active metabolite M1, making tramadol less effective upon its concomitant usage.25In vitro studies of methadone show a greater tendency toward serotonin reuptake inhibition compared with other opiates, which may explain methadone-mediated precipitation of serotonin syndrome.4In our first case, SA's increased use of methadone was responsible for precipitation of serotonin syndrome.Tramadol is a racemic mixture of RR and SS enantiomers. It is metabolized by liver enzymes to a more pharmacologically active metabolite, M1.14The RR enantiomer is a μ receptor agonist, while the SS enantiomer inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and releases serotonin.25Thus tramadol results in intrasynaptic serotonin excess when combined with other serotonergic drugs.6Dextromethorphan, a d-isomer of levorphanol, is a cough suppressant via action on σ opioid receptors. Its active metabolite, dextrorphan, antagonizes N -methyl D -aspartate receptors, whereas dextromethorphan itself binds 5-HT2Areceptors that may cause serotonin syndrome.14,24,25Since the hepatic enzyme, CYP2D6 metabolizes it; an inhibitor of CYP2D6 can also further increase serotonin levels.14Serotonin syndrome is a diagnostic challenge because of its variable and overlapping clinical manifestations. This is further confounded by overall lack of awareness among physicians,7,26limitations of diagnostic criteria, inaccurate diagnosis, and individual differences in serotonin metabolism.26In fact, milder forms of this disorder may go unrecognized.14Our second case report exemplifies all of these challenges, which led to two misdiagnoses before serotonin syndrome was correctly diagnosed and treated.Serotonin syndrome should not be a diagnosis of exclusion but one made after careful history-taking, to glean information on changes in serotonin agents, and a focused physical exam. Index of suspicion should be high with a history of serotonergic agent intake and other medical and psychiatric conditions need to be excluded.6,7,12Patients with a history of known exposure to serotonergic agents may have a constellation of clinical symptoms described as a triad4,7,10,11,26of:Mental status changes: Anxiety, agitation, confusion, hypomania, visual hallucinations, restlessness, disorientation, and coma.Neuromuscular abnormalities: Muscle rigidity, tremors, nystagmus, myoclonus, ocular clonus, hyperreflexia, ataxia, and trismus.Autonomic instability: hyper/hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, diarrhea, mydriasis, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia.A predictable spectrum of symptom manifestation directly correlates with intrasynaptic serotonin level6,11,27,28(fig. 2). Milder forms may present with anxiety, akathisia, diarrhea, and tremors, but full-blown serotonin syndrome may present with altered mental status and myoclonus. Severe serotonin toxicity, however, may be a life-threatening crisis with muscular rigidity more pronounced in lower extremities, hyperthermia, and coma.6,11Symptoms with escalating toxicity, if left untreated, may result in more severe complications including metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, seizures, and death.3,7,10Typically, serotonin syndrome symptoms present soon after the offending medication regimen is initiated. Usually symptoms appear within 6 h of ingestion of the drug or drugs (60% of cases). By 24 h, a majority (more than 75%) of patients are symptomatic.7,10In a subset of patients (7%), some of whom are older, the onset may be delayed for a few days because of a decreased neurotransmitter serotonin synthesis and decreased receptor density with age (18% fall in 5-HT2Areceptors per decade).29Although symptoms resolve within 24 h of stopping the offending agent, in 60–70% of serotonin cases, there is still a 2–12% mortality risk associated with serotonin toxicity.7,15No specific lab abnormality is diagnostic of serotonin syndrome.7,12Blood serotonin level does not correlate with the severity of the disease since it does not reflect intrasynaptic serotonin level. Some observed lab abnormalities include electrolyte derangements, metabolic acidosis, increased creatinine, and increased serum aminotransferase.10,12,15These are associated with muscular hypertonicity and possible rhabdomyolysis, which may be seen in cases of severe serotonin toxicity.6,7,11Due to lack of specific laboratory tests, several clinical diagnostic criteria for serotonin syndrome have been established.3,7,30Of course, a history of recent exposure to serotonergic agent(s) is a prerequisite to considering serotonin syndrome and utilization of these criteria. The two most commonly used criteria for diagnosing serotonin syndrome are shown in table 3. They are Sternbach's Criteria, (sensitivity 75%, specificity 96%),11,30and Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria, (sensitivity 84%, specificity 97%).30Several medical conditions, some involving toxicity, can mimic serotonin syndrome.4Many of these can be ruled out by careful, thorough history and physical examination. The clinical mimics include: neuroleptic syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, anticholinergic syndrome, opioid withdrawal, and acute opioid toxicity31(table 4).Neuroleptic syndrome can be precipitated by use of antipsychotic medications and may present with similar symptoms, such as hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, pallor, stupor, and coma. The two entities differ in onset of symptoms, hyporeflexia, decrease or normal bowel sounds, lead-pipe rigidity, and hyperthermia of more than 41°C.14,31Malignant hyperthermia is differentiated by exposure to inhaled halogenated anesthetics or depolarizing paralytic agents with associated hyperthermia of 42–46°C, hypercarbia, acidosis, muscular rigidity, hyporeflexia, decreased bowel sound along with hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, mottled skin, and agitation.14,31Anticholinergic syndrome carries a history of tricyclic antidepressant or anticholinergic agent use and is associated with dry mouth, blurred vision, delirium, decreased bowel sounds along with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperthermia of 40°C.31Serotonin syndrome has a favorable prognosis with symptoms resolving in the majority of cases within 24 h of stopping the serotonergic agent10; however, in 30–40%, symptoms persist beyond 24 h and require more intense care15(fig. 2). Anxiety and agitation can be managed with anxiolytics. Moderate to severe presentation may require serotonin receptor antagonists, i.e. , cyproheptadine (per oral form in 2 mg incremental doses for a maximum of 12–32 mg in 24 h) or chlorpromazine, a phenothiazine derivative, (available in oral and intravenous formulation in a dose of 50–100 mg) to decrease intrasynaptic serotonin level through 5-HT blocking action.4,7,10Cyproheptadine is only available in oral form, which limits its usage if oral intake is not possible or activated charcoal is already used in management of toxic agent ingestion. Chlorpromazine is the preferred alternative as it can be administered in intravascular form, but the patient needs to be well hydrated to prevent significant hypotension from its use.4,9Severe symptoms require intensive care for neuromuscular paralysis and subsequent ventilatory support4,10,27to decrease rigidity, hyperthermia, and complications of rhabdomyolysis. Succinylcholine and physical restraints should be avoided due to detrimental effect in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. The symptoms can also be managed by nitroglycerine through its conversion to nitric oxide,32short-acting benzodiazepines (i.e. , Lorazepam) for agitation, anxiety and hyperexcitatory symptoms,10,12and β blockers (i.e. , propranolol) for autonomic symptoms of serotonin syndrome.11,12A recent case report suggested some promise in the use of Intralipid for severe serotonin toxicity for its transient ability to draw tissue and receptor bound serotonergic drugs into lipid-expanded intravascular compartment, trapping them in a lipid phase33(fig. 2).It is undeniably easier to prevent than to have to treat serotonin syndrome. Prescribing physicians should strive to identify at-risk patients by maintaining clear and frequent communication with other prescribing physicians regarding changes and addition of new medications. Patients in an older age group, with multiple comorbidities or polypharmacy along with serotonergic drugs (fig. 1), or on monoamine oxidase inhibitors, should be considered as relatively high risk for development of serotonin syndrome. Physicians should also select the less toxic anticonvulsants, acetaminophen, and morphine, over morphine analogues and piperidine opioids, when appropriate. Upon switching serotonergic agents, care should be given regarding their half-life to provide enough washout periods before trying newer serotonergic agent.7Serotonin syndrome is a complication of polypharmacy that has been described in the literature for decades. Its occurrence is attributed to missed and inaccurate diagnosis. Factors responsible for the missed diagnosis include lack of awareness and knowledge among health professionals regarding its clinical presentation and clear understanding of interactions among the multiple serotonergic medications. Variations in serotonin metabolism, overlapping clinical presentation, mild symptoms, and limitation of diagnostic criteria often make the diagnosis challenging. The common offending agents have been well characterized but there needs be a shift in attention to the commonly prescribed opioids as a possible trigger for the potentially deadly serotonin syndrome.Anesthesiologists need to be aware of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome in the perioperative setting, where high dose opioids are often administered. Similarly, practitioners in chronic pain management, where use of opioids in conjunction with other serotonergic agents is the norm, must also have heightened sense of awareness. Patient history should be carefully evaluated for concomitant use of serotonergic agents including mono-amine-oxidase inhibitor, SSRIs, and several nonprescribed agents, such as herbal medications, St. John's wort,34the street drug ecstasy,27,35commonly used cough syrup ingredient dextromethorphan, and weight loss drugs fenfluramine35and sibutramine. In addition, methylene blue37dye, which is commonly used intraoperatively to delineate lymphovascular channels, has also been shown to be associated with severe serotonin syndrome. Thus, seemingly unrelated classes of pharmacological agents have the potential to cause serotonin syndrome with simultaneous use of serotonergic agents. Opioids have now been recognized to be such an agent.The mechanism of increased serotonin levels caused by commonly used opioids is still being studied, and treatment options involve mostly supportive care of manifesting symptoms. Future therapy may be directed toward identifying the molecular and pharmacological variables and specific receptor action and/or antagonism, but the most effective treatment is likely preventive medicine. Polypharmacy needs to be carefully selected, monitored, and avoided where possible to achieve better patient care and decrease the risk of excessive socioeconomic burden to society.1As more research and physician awareness is directed toward serotonin syndrome, our insight into the condition will invariably expand, and both morbidity and mortality will be reduced.",

      "title": "28.1 VARIETIES OF SELF DISORDER: A BIO-PHENO-SOCIAL MODEL OF SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "The self-disorder model offers a unifying way of conceptualizing schizophrenia’s highly diverse symptoms (positive, negative, disorganized), of capturing their distinctive bizarreness, and of conceiving their longitudinal development. These symptoms are viewed as differing manifestations of an underlying disorder of ‘core-self’: hyperreflexivity/diminished-self presence with accompanying disturbances of “grip” or “hold” on reality. We have recently revised and tested this phenomenological model, in particular distinguishing primary versus-secondary factors, in offering a bio-pheno-social model of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The revised model is consistent with recent empirical findings and offers several advantages: 1) It helps account for the temporal variations of the symptoms or syndrome, including longitudinal progression, but also the shorter-term, situationally-reactive, sometimes defensive, and possibly quasi-agentive variability of symptom-expression that can occur in schizophrenia (consistent with understanding some aspects of self-disturbance as dynamic and mutable, involving shifting attitudes or experiential orientations). 2) It accommodates the overlapping of some key schizophrenic symptoms with certain non-schizophrenia spectrum conditions involving dissociation (depersonalization and derealization), including Depersonalization Disorder and Panic Disorder, thereby acknowledging both shared and distinguishing symptoms. 3) It integrates recent neurocognitive, neurobiological, and psychosocial (e.g., influence of trauma and culture) findings into a coherent but multi-factorial neuropsychological account. An adequate model of schizophrenia will postulate shared disturbances of core-self experiences that nevertheless can follow several distinct pathways and occur in various forms. Such a model is preferable to uni-dimensional alternatives—whether of schizophrenia or core self disturbance—given its ability to account for distinctive yet varying experiential and neurocognitive abnormalities found in research on schizophrenia, and to integrate these with recent psychosocial as well as neurobiological findings.",

      "title": "The Explanation of Impulsive Action",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Impulsive action, such as binge eating or drinking, wrist‐slashing, compulsive promiscuity or chronically explosive marital conflict, presents serious problems for psychoanalysis. Such action evokes explanations both from the analyst and from the patient. The analyst may be held captive by explanatory notions that emphasise one aspect of impulsive action rather than the whole process. These explanations are based on our notions of drive pressure, adaptation, control and attack of intimate persons, ‘acting out,’ and the ‘compulsion to repeat’. The patient's explanations may be either consciously stated or inferred by the analyst as unconscious‘explanations’from associative material. If the patient's explanations dovetail with or adapt to those of the analyst, the analyst may take them as confirmatory, and the whole process of breakdown and restitution may escape analytic scrutiny. This process includes: (1) a precipitant that is narcissistically wounding; (2) a prodrome consisting of an experience of lack or absence which the patient feels as persecution, and a restitutive phantasy of the lack as fillable by a consummatory act; (3) the act itself; (4) character defences that ward off mortification on awareness of personal disintegration (shame) or the consequences of the act (guilt); explanations emphasising guilt often screen those giving rise to shame; (5) an attempt to regulate distance to protect against narcissistic injury by keeping intimates from getting too close or too far away. The therapist's tendencies to overemphasise the precipitant, the meaning of the act, or its distance regulating may convey an attitude of blame rather than understanding. Therapeutic emphasis on the subjective experience in an unintegrated way is sympathy, not empathy; sympathy is collusive and fosters splitting and impedes working with the negative transference. Blame or sympathy may be buttressed by the type of explanation accepted by analyst and patient. Explanatory preconceptions must be transcended to do effective interpretive work. Interpretation should convey understanding of a preoccupied ego that manifests its disorganising and restitutive propensities in the process of impulsive action.",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

      "title": "The Use of Prescription Drugs and Drugs of Abuse for Neuroenhancement in Europe",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Pharmacological neuroenhancement, defined as the misuse of prescription drugs, illicit drugs, or alcohol for the purpose of enhancing cognition, mood, or prosocial behavior, is not widespread in Europe – nevertheless, it does occur. Thus far, no drug has been proven as safe and effective for cognitive enhancement in otherwise healthy individuals. European studies have investigated the misuse of prescription and illicit stimulants to increase cognitive performance as well as the use of tranquilizers, alcohol, and cannabis to cope with stress related to work or education. Young people in educational settings report pharmacological neuroenhancement more frequently than those in other settings. Although the regular use of drugs for neuroenhancement is not common in Europe, the irregular and low-dose usage of neuroenhancers might cause adverse reactions. Previous studies have revealed that obtaining adequate amounts of sleep and using successful learning techniques effectively improve mental performance, whereas pharmacological neuroenhancement is associated with ambiguous effects. Therefore, non-substance-related alternatives should be promoted to cope with stressful situations. This paper reviews the recent research on pharmacological neuroenhancement in Europe, develops a clear definition of the substances used, and formulates recommendations for practitioners regarding how to react to requests for neuroenhancement drug prescriptions. We conclude that monitoring the future development of pharmacological neuroenhancement in Europe is important to provide effective preventive measures when required. Furthermore, substance use to cope with stress related to work or education should be studied in depth because it is likely more prevalent and dangerous than direct neuroenhancement.",

      "title": "Olanzapine-induced akathisia treated with clozapine",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Akathisia is probably the most troublesome side effect of antipsychotic medications. The onset of akathisia may be acute, chronic, tardive, or delayed, or may occur when switching or stopping antipsychotics. While its mechanism is poorly understood, the current hypothesis is low dopaminergic tone, with studies showing interactions in mesolimbic, mesocortical, and spinal dopamine/norepinephrine pathways and the involvement of multiple other neurotransmitter systems.[1] Second-generation antipsychotics such as olanzapine have a very low propensity to cause akathisia but are not entirely free of such side effects.[2] A 32-year-old woman presented with an 11-year history suggestive of prominent delusion of infidelity, hallucinatory behavior, aggression toward her husband, forgetfulness, and poor personal hygiene. She was diagnosed with psychosis not otherwise specified with a differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, with no history of prior psychiatric treatment. The patient was started on increasing doses of Tab. Risperidone up to 6 mg/day. She developed extrapyramidal side effects, which were treated with Tab. Trihexyphenidyl up to 4 mg/day, which she was not able to tolerate due to its side effects of excessive dryness of mouth and constipation. Risperidone was cross-tapered with olanzapine, which was gradually increased to 10 mg/day. Although with 10 mg olanzapine, her symptoms improved, the patient reported subjective restlessness, with the patient complaining of the urge to move around. She was observed to be fidgety, tapping her feet, and difficulty sitting still. This warranted a diagnosis of olanzapine-induced akathisia. The patient was prescribed Tab. Propranolol 20 mg with only minimal improvement in symptoms of akathisia. Olanzapine was cross-tapered with increasing doses of clozapine with which akathisia completely resolved and psychotic symptoms also improved considerably. The patient on the last follow-up was in full remission on clozapine 200 mg/day. Drugs such as clozapine and quetiapine, which have a weak dopaminergic action and a more potent serotonergic effect, may rarely cause akathisia in the absence of another antipsychotic.[1] Treatment of akathisia must ideally start with prevention, psychosocial methods, and modifications in the treatment such as careful cross-tapering of potent with less potent antipsychotics with close monitoring of psychotic symptoms.[1] In our patient, the change in medication from Olanzapine to Clozapine showed significant improvement in her psychotic symptoms as well as ameliorated the akathisia. Other pharmacological interventions include beta-blockers such as propranolol, which was the first-line treatment for akathisia. Anticholinergics and benzodiazepines have some therapeutic value as well but their effects may not be sufficient to reduce akathisia. Newer treatments include Mianserine and Cyproheptadine, which have the potential to counteract psychotropic-induced D2 receptor blockade. Another new intervention is the use of low-dose Mirtazapine.[3] Akathisia may also develop due to drug-drug interactions between psychotropic medications and other drugs such as antimicrobials. Therefore, it is important to take a detailed medical history in order to identify and/or prevent side effects that may be caused by such drug interactions.[4] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms. In the form, the patient has given her consent for her images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal.

      "abstract": "It is well known that continued excessive alcohol consumption can lead to the development of physiological dependence. When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

The acute confusional syndrome (ACS) is a familiar process that may occur after hospitalisation and which can be defined as a transitory mental disorder, characterised by a global disturbance in cognition and attention as well as a low consciousness level, an alteration of psychomotor function and a disorder in the sleep-wake cycle. It appears in a sudden, acute way, specially at night, together with other organic processes and it has got a relatively short duration (less than a month) Objective: to analyse the population and its demographic and clinical features in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and show nursing contribution after a clinical trial on actions in ACS cases. Instruments and methodology Type of research: clinical trial, randonized, not blind , with parallel samples, prospective, analytical and longitudinal. Sample: patients hospitalized in the ICU that comply with the required characteristics. Case: patient who develops ACS in the ICU and who has all the inclusion requirements and has no exclusion ones. Place : The ICU of the Hospital General Universitario in the Region of Murcia. Timing : Two years of field research. Development: after the patient admission in the ICU, general data is collected, implementing familiar risks factors, sociodemographic data and clinical data among others. CAM-ICU and scale level of sedation (SAS) validated questionnaires are provided to the nursing staff, who will implement environmental control measures, reorientation and other interventions in the study group. Statistical processing : by means of IBM SPSS Statistics v.20. A descriptive statistic with calculated weighted mean has been applied, together with standard deviation for the quantitative variables and frequencies and percentages for the qualitative ones. The statistical inference has been calculated on a maximum error of 5% and a 95% of reliability (confidence), accepting statistical meaning if p Calculation of Chi of Pearson, with study of corrected non-valid data. For the expected lower frequences, the Fisher exact statistics has been applied. The Student T Test has been used for the comparison of independent samples for the equality of means. Ethical considerations : The study has been approved by the CEIC of the Health Department and the UMU Results: Population: 1093 patients; age: 65,4 years of age, DE16, male 64%; Level of severity APACHE II 15 out of 9; Average ICU stay: 5,77 days; Discarded samples: 15%; most frequent diagnosis: acute coronary syndrome without st elevation (SCASEST). 6,8% develop SCA and comply with requirements. Control group 34 (52%), intervention group 33 (48%). Their ICU stay has ranged between 7 and 11 days, having 5 predisposing factors and 6-7 precipitating factors. The SCA condition has lasted between 36 and 48 hours. The nursing staff provide a specific planning care to the study group, with an average of 14 interventions in every working shift, devoting 43,71 minutes. Conclusions: The epidemiologic profile of a patient with a SCA condition is male, 74,4 years old, independent, retired whose reason for hospitalisation is coronary heart disease and/ or sepsis/septic shock with a low-medium level of severity, with a medical history of ATH, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and stroke. Previous smoking habits have also proved to be an influential factor. The patients have been treated with Haloperidol for delirium control. The application of nursing methodology together with an individual care plan on these patients have been highly effective as it has reduced both the SCA process and patient recovery time.",

      "title": "Generalized Convulsive Status Epilepticus in the Adult",
      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (ICD-10 codes: F43.1, F62.0; DSM-IV-TR code: 309.81) [1, 2] is a complex severe and chronic psychiatric illness influenced by environmental and genetic factors [3-10]. PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, wit‐ nessing, or learning about an extreme physically or psychologically distressing event, asso‐ ciated with unprecedented violence [11, 12]. Traumatic events that can trigger PTSD include massacres, mass murder scenes, international, civil, political, ethnic and religious wars, gen‐ ocides, natural and man-made disasters, criminal assaults, serious accidents, terrorist at‐ tacks, incarceration, trafficking, rape and other types of sexual assaults [12-17], life threatening illness and the sudden death of a loved one, serious medical illness, injury, sur‐ gery, hostage, kidnapping, difficult labors, etc [18-20]. Individuals who experience a trauma of this nature may develop symptoms that fall into three distinct clusters: re-experiencing phenomenon; avoidance and numbing; and autonomic hyperarousal. Symptoms usually be‐ gin within the first 3 months after the traumatic event and last for many years, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. PTSD patients are characterized by severe emotional state, sharp reduction in adaptive and information receiv‐ ing abilities. They usually remain out of society, become drug addicted, alcoholic and often commit suicide [21-24]. Degrees of risk to develop PTSD from different traumatic events are presented in table 1.",

      "title": "[Abnormal behavior and adaptation problems in dogs and cats and their pharmacologic control].",
      "abstract": "Small animal practitioners are increasingly confronted with patients showing adaptation related problems (ARP) which are expressed as disturbed or abnormal behavior (DAB). As a result, practitioners are asked increasingly to euthanize animals which seemingly cannot be socialized. In healthy dogs and cats, three main causes for DAB can be detected: refusal of obedience because of the drive for dominance; anxiety and frustration; and geriatric DAB. Increasingly, disease conditions not readily diagnosed can cause DAB, especially hypothyroidism. Influencing and contributing factors to DAB are breed, sex, experiences as a puppy, behavior of owners, changes in the pet's environment. ARPs may also cause disturbances in the condition of skin and fur, e.g. atopic dermatitis, pruritus sine materia, lick granuloma, and of the intestinal organs (vomiting, irritated bowel syndrome) and may result in an immune deficiency. Therapeutic approaches include behavioral therapy, surgical or hormonal castration with progestins or antiandrogens, substitution with thyroxin in cases with hypothyroidism, and/or the use of psychopharmaca, most prominently of modern antidepressiva like amitriptyline; buspirone; clomipramine and fluoxetine, but also of selegiline, a mono-aminoxydase inhibitor. These compounds, among other effects, are elevating prolactin levels. This seems to allow to formulate a working hypothesis: in the canine species, prolactin is obviously a hormone enabling socialization; hence all drugs which safely cause an increase in prolactin production might be suitable to manage or control ARPs and DAB in the dog, but also in the cat. Higher levels of prolactin than those required for socialization, as seen in nursing bitches or some clinically overt cases of pseudopregnancy, may cause maternal aggression and can be controlled with prolactin inhibitors, if needed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical phenomena or behavior that develop during the sleep period. These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONEpilepsy is a neurological disorder affecting 1% of the total population worldwide. In India, the prevalence rate is 5.59 per thousand (Bharucha, 2003). Epilepsy or seizure can be defined as occasional, sudden, excessive rapid and local discharges of grey matter (Jackson, 1873). The clinical manifestation of epilepsy is synapse, drying of mouth, nausea, blurring of vision. The basic mechanism of epilepsy is due to many cellular changes in membrane conductance and neurotransmitter alterations affecting the neuronal interaction.Cognitive deficits are seen in areas of attention, memory and executive functioning. Behavioural and personality disturbances are also present.(Benett, 1992). Circumstantialities are seen in both spoken and written language. Slowness in thinking, poor abstraction and calculation ability are other cognitive deficits seen in epileptic patients. The nature and extent of cognitive deficits depend on seizure type, frequency, age of onset, duration of disorder and the etiology (Benett, 1992).Restoration and reestablishment are the techniques employed for cognitive remediation. Along with it compensatory techniques are also employed. Neuropsychological remediation is used for correcting different facets of cognitive deficits like attention, memory, executive functioning. They have been attempted at hyper-active children, alcoholics and people with psychiatric decomposition.AIMThe aim of the study was to develop and test the efficacy of cognitive remedial measures.HYPOTHESISThere will be significant difference in the pre and post therapy cognitive scores in the various tests.METHODOLOGYDESIGN OF THE STUDYSamplingThe purposive sampling method was taken to collect the sample. Patients fulfilling the criteria of the study were contacted. The sample size was 46 out of which after the elimination of the drop outs the sample size remained 30. The inclusion and exclusion for the sample size is as under:^ Inclusion criteria.^ Age between 18 and 45.^ Subjects having primary education.^ Persons having normal vision and hearing.^ On regular medication.^ Exclusion criteria:^ Subjects with any psychiatric and neurological illness.^ Mental retardation as assessed clinically.^ History of alcohol abuse.^ Symptomatic epilepsy.ProcedureThe sample was taken from two major hospitals and the criteria of local was kept in mind so that commuting won't be a problem for the patients especially the treatment group. The patients who had consented for the cognitive remediation programme were included in the treatment group and the patients who were ready to come for 2-3 times were in the control group.The patients were psycho educated about the research and the benefits after their participation in the study.Pre therapy assessment:The number of tests administered were -1.

In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

Insomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness are the most frequent sleep complaints after traumatic brain injury. Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and parasomnias may also occur after a head injury. In addition, depression, anxiety, and pain are common brain injury comorbidities with significant influence on sleep quality. Two types of traumatic brain injury that may negatively impact sleep are acceleration/deceleration injuries causing generalized brain damage and contact injuries causing focal brain damage. Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and/or actigraphy may be utilized to diagnose sleep disorders after a head injury. Depending on the disorder, treatment may include the use of medications, positive airway pressure, and/or behavioral modifications. Unfortunately, the treatment of sleep disorders associated with traumatic brain injury may not improve neuropsychological function or sleepiness.

      "abstract": "The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder comprise various obsessions and compulsions with rituals, sensory abnormalities, doubts, overvalued ideas, speech abnormalities, emotional disturbances (depression, anxiety, irritability and others), immediate memory deficits and minor (soft) neurological signs. Actually, obsessive-compulsive disorder is a heterogeneous syndrome that includes subtypes that overlap with both anxiety and mood disorders. Although new findings on obsessive-compulsive disorder allow the development of theories on the etiology and suggest therapeutic approaches, new pathways are still being sought to explain the intriguing enigma of obsessions. The search for biological markers in obsessive-compulsive disorder is relatively new, as most literature in this field has been produced in the past decade. The major hypothesis on the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder relates to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), on the basis of an almost exclusive response to serotonergic drugs by patients with the disorder. Furthermore, in recent years a growing number of neuropsychiatric studies have documented an impairment in both cognitive and sensory motor functions in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Together with neuroimaging studies and neurosurgical research, some neuroanatomical models of obsessive-compulsive disorder have been developed. These models have focused on reciprocal connections between frontal cortex and basal ganglia. Advances in brain-imaging techniques (positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon computed tomography, magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance) and the development of specific radiolabeled serotonergic ligands should allow the in-vivo visualization of structure-function relationship, and may lead to a better understanding of this illness.",

      "abstract": "The most common diagnoses associated with psychosis in geriatric patients are, in order, major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Visual hallucinations may reflect delirium or neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Lewy body disease. This chapter focuses only on non-schizophrenic late-life psychosis. Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

      "title": "Illusion and reality in the study of sleep, hypnosis, psychosis, and arousal",
      "abstract": "Abstract All hypnoidal phenomena, i.e. both the process of induction and the achieved state, involve an interaction among many components of psychodynamic and psychophysiological processes, as these are manifested in sleep, in waking, in all intermediate phases, and especially in all transitions among them. These interactions and transitional processes also produce many illusory phenomena whose precise nature has not yet been clarified. For example, \"suggestibility\" and the \"influence\" which the hypnotist supposedly can exercise over the subject have been looked upon as essential components in hypnosis, yet we do not know to what extent they are real or to what extent they are illusory. As has been pointed out before (Kubie, 1961a, 1961b; Kubie & Margolin, 1942, 1944a, 1944b), we can be relatively certain that, both with regard to input and output, changes in the quantity, variety, rate, and amplitude of change are related in turn to changes in central excitatory and/or inhibitory processes, and that the shift from a major dependence upon exteroceptive to a major dependence upon interoceptive and proprioceptive afferent input is a basic ingredient in all hypnoidal phenomena. Clearly these can be influenced by physiological processes; yet at the same time they require a lessening of the alerting mechanisms that automatically mobilize anxiety and anger, by which these in turn will be influenced, thus interacting with their roles in the total process. We have a more precise concept about the nature of the process of induction than of the state, but we still lack sufficiently precise concepts and criteria of both. In the absence of such criteria, meaningful correlations are still uncertain.",

      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

      "abstract": "The adolescent period is a crucial time for brain development. Emotional skills mature, knowledge deepens, and coping skills develop. However, the development of depression during this period of life can have severe and potentially permanent effects on a person's life. The prevalence of adolescents with mental disorders, especially depression, has been steadily increasing. The diagnosis of depression is often accompanied by co-occurring, comorbid disorders (eg, psychosis, anxiety, conduct issues, and oppositional defiant behavior), addictive behaviors, and a preexisting or ongoing history of traumatic exposure. Untreated depression affects the ability to pursue education, to be consistently employed, and to have adequate physical health. Treatment options for depression in adolescents include pharmacological management and psychotherapy. Only two antidepressant agents (fluoxetine and escitalopram) are approved for treatment of depression in adolescents, with no approved augmentation agents. Psychotherapeutic interventions that include the family network show advantage over individual-centered therapy alone. Among individual-centered therapies, cognitive-behavioral interventions have the most support. A modular treatment approach with multifocus areas is the most effective, with shorter treatment duration and faster, more sustained symptomatic improvement. In cases of comorbid depression and substance use, treatment of substance use is usually not enough, so treatment of depressive symptoms is also necessary. Lastly, the contribution and impact of trauma in the genesis and perpetuation of depression cannot be emphasized enough, and successful treatment needs to address trauma antecedents and prioritize safety.

      "abstract": "A esquizofrenia é uma doença mental crônica que afeta a maneira como uma pessoa pensa, sente e se comporta. Caracterizada por sintomas como delírios, alucinações, confusão e dificuldade de concentração, seus sintomas podem variar em intensidade e frequência, geralmente se manifestando na adolescência ou início da idade adulta. Afetando cerca de 1% da população mundial, a esquizofrenia tem raízes em uma complexa interação entre fatores genéticos, neurobiológicos e ambientais. Alterações nos neurotransmissores, como dopamina e glutamato, desempenham um papel significativo na fisiopatologia da doença, que também está ligada a anomalias estruturais e funcionais do cérebro. O diagnóstico da esquizofrenia é feito através de uma avaliação clínica detalhada, com critérios estabelecidos como os do DSM-5 ou CID-10. O tratamento geralmente envolve uma combinação de medicamentos antipsicóticos, como clorpromazina, haloperidol, olanzapina, risperidona e quetiapina, e terapia psicossocial. A escolha do medicamento depende de vários fatores, incluindo a gravidade dos sintomas e a tolerabilidade do paciente. Embora esses medicamentos sejam eficazes no controle dos sintomas, eles podem estar associados a efeitos colaterais, e é essencial monitorar de perto os pacientes durante o tratamento. Um estudo recente revisou a literatura dos últimos 5 anos sobre métodos terapêuticos medicamentosos para o controle da esquizofrenia. Foram selecionados 6 estudos que abordaram tratamentos eficazes para a esquizofrenia, incluindo medicamentos como xanomelina, tróspio, dexmedetomidina, raloxifeno, tropissetron, blonanserina e olanzapina. Esses estudos mostraram redução dos sintomas da esquizofrenia, apesar de apresentarem diferentes perfis de efeitos colaterais e eficácia. Mais pesquisas são necessárias para compreender totalmente o potencial de cada medicamento no tratamento desse transtorno. Em suma, a esquizofrenia é uma condição que requer uma abordagem holística e colaborativa, com tratamentos eficazes e monitoramento cuidadoso dos pacientes para melhorar sua qualidade de vida.",

In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation.

      "title": "Familial Dysautonomia",
      "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia or the Riley-Day syndrome was first described in 1949 with a report of five cases (14). Dysautonomia refers to the characteristic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system upon which are superimposed both motor and sensory abnormalities; familial refers to the genetic nature of the abnormality, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait occurring almost exclusively in Jewish families of East European extraction (12). The clinical features may be grouped into major categories resulting from apparent dysfunction of the dominantly involved systems: (a) episodic hypertension and postural hypotension, transient (erythematous) blotching of the skin, cool extremities, excessive perspiration, hypolacrimation, episodic unexplained fever, episodic vomiting; (b) disordered swallowing, dysarthria, motor inco-ordination; (c) marked diminution in sensory modalities (notably pain and taste), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, corneal hypesthesia (leading to corneal scarring). Additional, almost constant features are emotional lability, recurrent pulmonic infection, kyphoscoliosis, and other bony changes. The occasional occurrence of convulsions is noted, but mental retardation is not thought to be an important primary feature of this syndrome. Recent communications have emphasized the probably pathognomonic absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue with the presumed absence of the associated taste buds; frequently there is concomitant absence of the circumvallate papillae (4, 15). Pharmacologic investigations have revealed hypersensitivity to both norepinephrine and methacholine, absence of normal responses to intradermal histamine, and restoration of many of the abnormal sensory and parasympathetic findings with infused methacholine (4, 16). Despite the wide array of symptomatology and despite the fact that the radiologist is frequently involved with the initial diagnosis of this disease because of the chronic and recurrent pneumonic episodes that often mimic cystic fibrosis, there is a dearth of radiographic literature available concerning this syndrome. Kirkpatrick and Riley in 1957 discussed the general radiographic findings (10). They found that chronic bronchopneumonia was the most common and important radiographic feature. They also reported the skeletal changes of abnormal and retarded growth, of kyphoscoliosis, and of traumatic sequelae in a large percentage of their cases. Of their 7 patients who underwent examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, none showed any major abnormality, although one patient had nonpersistent pylorospasm. Linde and Westover in 1962 discussed the esophageal and gastric changes seen in their 6 patients (11). Difficulty in swallowing was present in 2.",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

The nosology of anxiety.Anxiety is phenomenologically defined as a state experienced as fear or tension dependent on whether psychic or somatic manifestations prevail. Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "title": "The role of the cognitive biases along the psychosis continuum: from pathophysiology to treatment options",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia and related psychoses is primarily characterized by positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive disturbances. Cognitive factors crucial in the pathogenesis of psychosis are specifically studied in terms of cognitive biases that may play a role in the formation and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. Cognitive biases refer to systematic errors in both cognitive processing and content that deviate from logical thinking. Cognitive biases can affect attention, decision-making/reasoning, memory recall, motivation or even attributional style. Psychotic-like experiences and psychotic disorders have been associated with a tendency to jump to conclusions, bias against disconfirmatory evidence and bias against confirmatory evidence as well as liberal acceptance bias. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia tend to present higher belief inflexibility in comparison to healthy individuals and are overconfident in wrong judgments. In the monitoring tasks showing they show a higher tendency to misattribute internally-generated stimuli to external sources (externalizing bias) (1). Finally, patients with schizophrenia tend to have excessive attention toward irrelevant, neutral or familiar stimuli known as the salience aberrant bias. There are several specific psychological interventions designed to ameliorate cognitive biases, such as Metacognitive Training (2,3), Thinking Well (4), Social Cognition and Interaction Training (5). These trainings have been shown to teach patients about cognitive biases and how they contribute to symptoms of psychosis and consequently how they can affect their daily life. There is an increasing number of studies showing results of these interventions in reducing cognitive biases and positive symptoms as well as improving clinical and cognitive insight.",

      "title": "Seizures And Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

Primjenjuje se u lijecenju epilepsije, kronicnih bolnih sindroma, trigeminalne neuralgije i psihijatrijskih bolesti (bipolarni poremecaj, rezistentna depresija, „ borderline“ sindrom). Vecina bolesnika dobro podnosi uzimanje lijeka. Kao nuspojave se mogu javiti gubitak apetita, mucnina, ataksija, dvoslike, povracanje, uz mogucnost rijetkih nuspojava kao agranulocitoza, aplasticna anemija, pseudolimfom, sistemski lupus eritematodes (SLE ). Karbamazepinom induciran SLE nastaje najranije unutar nekoliko mjeseci od pocetka administracije lijeka. Ova nuspojava je iznimno rijetka i javlja se kao „ izolirani slucaj“ (manje od 0.001%). Klinicka manifestacija SLE iskazuje se kao osip, povisena tjelesna temperatura, bolovi u zglobovima, s nalazom leukopenije, uz pozitivna antinuklearna antitijela (ANA). Nakon ukidanja lijecenja karbamazepinom dolazi do normalizacije leukopenije i titra ANA. Prikazujemo slucaj bolesnice rođene 1974.g. koja se lijeci od epilepsije od 8.g. života. Inicijalno se radilo o grand mal atakama, a tijekom iducih nekoliko godina pojavili su se i drugi klinicki fenotipovi - kompleksna parcijalna epilepsija temporalnog ishodista uz miokolonizme. Antiepilepticko lijecenje se zapocinje metilfenobarbitonom i fenitoinom, a cetiri godine kasnije se u lijecenje uvede karbamazepin. Tijekom 1998.g. dolazi do prvih klinickih znakova SLE u vidu kožnog osipa, afta, umora, malaksalosti s nalazom leukopenije, hipergamaglobulinemije i pozitivnog titra ANF (antinuklearnog faktora). Zapoceto je lijecenje klorokinom, a iskljucen je karbamazepin. Tijekom daljnjeg tijeka bolesti provodi se kombinirana antiepilepticka terapija, ali s nedovoljnom kontrolom epileptickih ataka, te rjeđim relapsima i dužim remisijama SLE tijekom kojih dolazi do normalizacije krvne slike: nalazi ADNA (Antitijela na dvolancanu DNA), ANF, ENA (antitijela na ekstrahirani nuklearni antigen), aCL (antikardiolipinska antitijela) su negativni. U literaturi se navodi mogucnost indukcije SLE kod lijecenja karbamazepinom, kao i fenitoinom koji je bolesnica tijekom lijecenja uzimala u dualnoj terapiji s karbamazepinom. Postavlja se pitanje da li uvijek po ukidanju antiepileptika dolazi do spontane regresije simptoma SLE, ili on može prijeci u klinicki oblik idiopatskog SLE s relapsima i remisijama osnovne bolesti, sto mislimo da je slucaj u nase bolesnice. Buduci da komorbiditet epilepsije i SLE nije rijedak, kao i obzirom na sve cesca promisljanja da je jedan od patofizioloskih cimbenika epilepsije upala, dodatno bi se trebala obratiti pozornost pri odabiru antiepilepticke terapije.",

According to this theory. a primary neurocognitive dysfunction is the core of schizophrenia and underlies symptom formation, The suggested perceptual fragmentation of external stimuli and inability to connect such perceptions with internal schemata is suggested to lead to positive symptoms, while defensive self-restriction and the exhaustion of the mental apparatus lead to negative symptomatology. Objections to this theory include observations (i) that patients with dominant positive symptoms, e.g., delusions, hallucinations, manifest better neurocognitive function and (ii) that typically antipsychotics significantly reduce positive symptoms and thus improve both the clinical picture and the functioning (to the extent it is reduced with positive symptoms) of the patients, yet have little or no effect on negative, e.g., loss of volition, emotional blunting, and neurocognitive symptomatology, e.g., attentional and memory deficit. The literature suggests that neurocognitive symptoms group independently of other symptomatology. It is suggested that there is currently more evidence against than in favor of the ‘cognitive dysmetria’ theory.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The National Institute of Mental Health describe the main symptoms of bipolar disorder as alternating episodes of high and low mood. Changes in energy levels, sleep patterns, ability to focus, and other features can dramatically impact a person’s behavior, work, relationships, and other aspects of life. Most people experience mood changes at some time, but those related to bipolar disorder are more intense than regular mood changes, and other symptoms can occur. Some people experience psychosis, which can include delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Objectives Through this research we aimed to identify all the special features of bipolar depression which will help the clinical psychiatrists in easier diagnosis and management of the disorder. Methods Literature review (PubMed) Results Clinical Characteristics in Favour of Bipolarity in Depression: psychomotor retardation, history of psychotic depression,history of psychotic depression shortly after giving childbirth, frequent catatonic symptoms, atypical depressive features, severe impairment in interpersonal relationships, inconsistency in business life, history of hypomania, mania or mixed episode,common feeling of numbness and anhedonia; less common sadness and feelings of guilt, mood instability, volatility in temperament, frequent change in affect, daydreaming during the episode and daily life, short duration of depression &lt;3 months, poor cognitive functions during depressive episode, generally similar symptom severity during the day and night etc. Conclusions This leads to misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar depression, which in turn leads to delayed correct diagnosis and treatment and may severely affect the patient’s entire life.

      "title": "Adverse reactions to drugs",
      "abstract": "Abstract An adverse effect is an unwanted effect of a drug. Adverse effects can be due to either toxic effects or side effects. A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

      "abstract": "A subject is conscious when he is awake and with an adequate awareness of him and the environment. The term alteration of consciousness requires specification as to whether it defines alteration of arousal - when the patient might be confused, in a stupor or in some degree of coma (light, deep) - or alteration of awareness – that is, confused (spatiotemporally disorientated, with difficulty in maintaining his attention), with or without delirious ideation. The coma, in the strict sense, originates from structural (neurological) or functional (metabolic) dysfunction of the ascending reticular activator system, but it is accepted that it can derive also from diffuse bihemispheric cortical-subcortical damage. In the emergency department the starting point is the triad of situations that requires immediate treatment applying the normal protocol (ABC); next, pathologies involving risk to life, which might cause cerebral hypoxia, are ruled out: diminished cardiac output, shock and respiratory failure. Subsequently, a neurological evaluation is made, bearing in mind two situations of potential gravity: endocraneal hypertension and diseases that might cause respiratory failure due to muscular fatigue. Neurological exploration will specify the respiratory, pupil and ocular patterns and motor responses. The depth of the coma is established through scales; a simplification of Jouvet’s scale is proposed. The etiological diagnosis will on occasion require image tests and lumbar puncture.",

      "title": "Acute dystonic reaction due to a combination of chloroquine and doxycycline in an emergency psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects that are seen after the initiation or a rapid increase in the dose of neuroleptic drugs, mainly typical antipsychotics, and have a varied presentation, such as torticollis, trismus, “mouth opening” dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.[1] They frequently present to clinicians in an emergency setting and may sometimes be tricky to handle. Drug-induced movement disorders usually have a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset (some typically occurring with first dose).[1] They are also dose – dependent, and with the exception of tardive syndromes, have a complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent.[1] Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation, or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.[1] Chloroquine is a drug commonly used for the treatment of malaria and has been reported to have gastrointestinal problems, headaches, blurring of vision, and itching as the common side effects.[2] Dystonia induced by chloroquine, although rare, is not really new and is mentioned in patient information leaflets.[2] However, such incidents are rare and mainly have been reported with the first dose. No case reports on acute dystonic reactions with a stable dose of chloroquine or with doxycycline are available. In view of current coronavirus disease pandemic, several combinations of antibiotics and antivirals are being tried and this report necessitates an exercise of caution for possible adverse drug reactions. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency psychiatry setting with the complaints of difficulty in lowering his gaze, up-rolling of eyeballs, and difficulty in jaw opening for the last 2 h. On examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He had difficulty in opening his mouth and lowering his gaze. He appeared to have an acute dystonic reaction presenting with trismus and oculogyric crisis. Other aspects of his general examination were unremarkable. His systemic examination, which included an exhaustive neurological examination, was normal. All baseline investigations, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, and random blood glucose, were within normal limits. His resting electrocardiogram was also normal. There was no past history of similar complaints or of any transient ischemic attack, and he had neither a family history of dystonia nor a history of alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, or use of illicit drugs or history of taking psychotropic medications. On enquiry, the patient yielded that he had fever for the past 3–4 days, for which he was taking some medications from a physician. All his blood parameters were normal, and he had tested negative for dengue and malaria. However, as it is a common practice in India to empirically start a patient on antibiotics, he had been started on chloroquine (500 mg once daily dosing) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day). It was after his third dose that he had developed an acute dystonic reaction. Immediately, an injection of promethazine 50 mg was administered intramuscularly. After 15 min, there was some relief in his symptoms. Later on, after giving an injection of intravenous diazepam 5 mg, the patient's symptoms improved considerably. He was kept was observation for 2–3 h and later discharged on oral diazepam 5 mg once daily for 3 days. He was asked to discontinue the antibiotics, and on follow-up, the patient had no further complaints and reported 100% improvement. DISCUSSION Rampant use of antibiotics and their amalgamations has concerning effects such as antimicrobial resistance and higher occurrence of adverse side effects. While most side effects appear nonchalant, there are a few which could be life-threatening, such as acute dystonic reaction. Oculogyric crisis is the only form of acute dystonia that may occur, while the patient is receiving a stable dose of an antipsychotic drug; it may be provoked by alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, or suggestion.[3] Given the paucity of literature on chloroquine- and doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, we report a case of an acute dystonic reaction presenting as oculogyric crisis with trismus in a patient who was on a stable dose of chloroquine and doxycycline, being empirically treated for fever with a combination of antimalarial and broad-spectrum antibiotic. At a standard dose for malaria treatment, the common adverse effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, nightmare, blurring of vision, and itching. Using the Naranjo algorithm, the patient appeared to have probable adverse drug reaction when chloroquine was considered as a cause (score = 6). If doxycycline is considered as a cause alone, the score would be 5 indicating probable adverse drug reactions due to it. The difference of scoring occurs only on the first question of the algorithm as no report mentions dystonia due to doxycycline. This also sheds light on the importance of the first question of the Naranjo algorithm and the need to report such possible adverse reactions. Acute dystonic reactions usually result due to dopamine receptor-2 (D2) blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output.[1] The pathophysiological mechanism underlying chloroquine-associated acute dystonic reaction suggests a reduction in the forebrain catecholamine levels and an inhibition of neuronal calcium uptake.[4] Gamma aminobutyric acid has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute dystonic reactions, and this is supported by the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in reducing chloroquine-induced acute dystonic reactions.[1] This also explains why our patient improved with diazepam and promethazine had minimal effect on him. There is no available literature on doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, and whether this drug had a contribution in the development of oculogyric crisis in our patient is uncertain. The combination of chloroquine and doxycycline has been shown to be synergistic in the treatment of malaria with increased efficacy of chloroquine on addition of doxycycline.[5] This could perhaps also predispose patients on this combination to develop rare side effects such as dystonia. Doxycycline has been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and increase levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain and can theoretically lead to dystonia.[6] Hence, we advocate an index of suspicion for oculogyric crisis whenever these drugs are being prescribed, especially in combination.

      "abstract": "Cognitive psychology has provided clinicians with specific tools for analyzing the processes of cognition (memory, language) and executive functions (attention-concentration, abstract reasoning, planning). Neuropsychology, coupled with the neurosciences (including neuroimaging techniques), has authenticated the existence of early disorders affecting the \"superior or intellectual\" functions of the human brain. The prevalence of cognitive and attention disorders is high in adults because all the diseases implicating the central nervous system are associated with cognitive correlates of variable intensity depending on the disease process and the age of the patient. In some pathologies, cognitive impairment can be a leading symptom such as in schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder or an emblematic stigmata as in dementia including Alzheimer's disease. Paradoxically, public health authorities have only recognized as medications for improving cognitive symptoms those with proven efficacy in the symptomatic treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease; the other cognitive impairments are relegated to the orphanage of syndromes and symptoms dispossessed of medication. The purpose of this review is to promote a true \"pharmacology of cognition\" based on the recent knowledge in neurosciences. Data from adult human beings, mainly concerning memory, language, and attention processes, will be reported. \"Drug therapeutic strategies\" for improving cognition (except for memory function) are currently rather scarce, but promising perspectives for a new neurobiological approach to cognitive pharmacology will be highlighted.",

The 1970s witnessed an \"epidemic\" of dissociative disorder, particularly DID, which may have reflected enthusiasm for the diagnosis more than its actual prevalence. Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

It is well known that patients with depression often have deficits in verbal and visual memory, verbal fluency, attention and short-term memory. Some of these deficits have also been reported to be maintained beyond acute phases, during clinical remission and euthymia. Aims: To review current literature on cognitive deficits in major depressive disorder and its therapeutic approach.Methods: Non-systematic review of the literature available in the PubMed database using the keywords “depression”, “major depressive disorder”, “cognitive impairment”, “cognitive function”, “cognition”.Results and Conclusions: In some studies cognitive deficits in depression have been related with the use of antidepressant drugs. However, similar deficits were found in non-medicated patients who maintain residual cognitive deficits, even after adequate treatment and achievement of euthymia, with significant functional impairment. Variable patterns of cognitive deficits are found in patients receiving different antidepressants, when in remission of depressive episodes and without medication. The mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in major depressive disorder are not fully understood, but undoubtedly significantly impact patients’ lives. New therapeutic approaches towards cognitive complaints have been applied in these patients, such as cognitive remediation, previously used in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.",

L’action des MAEs au niveau des canaux ioniques et de leurs recepteurs est supposee modifier l’excitabilite neuronale, dans le sens d’une diminution des influx depolarisants (via les canaux sodium et calcium), ou dans le sens d’une augmentation de l’inhibition gabaergique. Dans certaines douleurs neuropathiques, on assiste a une redistribution et a des modifications de structure des sous-unites des canaux sodium et calcium. Ces alterations peuvent predisposer certains neurones a decharger spontanement, a des frequences inappropriees, parfois de sites ectopiques. Les MAEs peuvent specifiquement antagoniser ces effets, en bloquant les decharges a haute frequence. Dans certaines situations, les MAEs peuvent specifiquement viser certains canaux ou leurs sous-unites qui sont surexprimees dans certaines douleurs neuropathiques peripheriques. La gabapentine ou la pregabaline peuvent specifiquement se fixer sur la sous-unite alpha2 delta du canal calcium a haut voltage. Les mecanismes d’action des MAEs en tant que thymoregulateurs sont probablement differents. Ils semblent faire intervenir des phenomenes de signalisation cellulaire, dont le delai de mise en route est compatible avec le delai d’action des antidepresseurs.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a devastating brain disease that affects ∼1% of the population worldwide and is characterized by a complex array of positive (delusions and hallucinations), negative (apathy and social withdrawal), and cognitive (deficits in attention and working memory) symptoms. Clinical features of schizophrenia frequently arise during late adolescence or early adulthood, which places this disease as the most chronic of the psychotic disorders and as one of the leading causes of disability and premature mortality (1). Increasing evidence suggests that cognitive impairment is at the core of schizophrenia and precedes the manifestation of psychosis (2). Furthermore, no pharmacological treatment is currently available for cognitive deficits, which are among the most debilitating symptoms of the disorder. The identification of novel treatments to ameliorate the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia thus seems crucial to improve the quality of life in these patients.",

      "title": "Phenomenology and psychiatric origin of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) is a sudden change in a person's behavior, perception, thinking, or feeling that is usually time limited and resembles, or is mistaken for, epilepsy but does not have the characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that accompanies a true epileptic seizure [1]. It is considered that PNES is a somatic manifestation of mental distress, in response to a psychological conflict or other Stressors [2]. A wide spectrum of clinical presentation includes syncope, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, simple and complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure, frontal lobe seizures and status epilepticus [3]. Coexistence of epilepsy and PNES is seen in approximately 9% of cases [5]. Between 25-30% of patients referred to tertiary centers and initially diagnosed as refractory epilepsy were on further examination diagnosed as PNES [6,7]. In DSM-IV [12] PNES are usually categorized under conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions. However, psychiatric basis of PNES may be anxiousness (panic attack), somatization or factitious disorder, simulation, dissociative disorders and psychosis [1]. AIM The aim of the study was to establish clinical phenomenology and EEG characteristics as well as basic psychiatric disorder in patients with PNES. METHOD In a retrospective study covering the period from January 1st 1999 till April 31 st 2003, 24 patients (22 female, 2 male) treated at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade were analyzed. PNES were defined as sudden change in behavior incoherent with epileptiform activity registered on EEG. Possible PNES were determined on the basis of history data and clinical examination during the attack but definitive confirmation was established only by the finding of no ictal EEG changes during typical seizure of each patient. Patients with coexisting epilepsy were included in the study, too. At least two standard EEG (range 2-6, median 4) were performed at the beginning of diagnostic evaluation. Demographic data, clinical presentation (apparent loss of consciousness, type of convulsion and associated clinical signs) and placebo-induced seizures (administration of saline near the cubital vein) with EEG or video-EEG monitoring were analyzed. Basic psychiatric disorder was classified according to DSM IV classification criteria. RESULTS Duration of PNES was 4.7 years (range from 2 months to 30 years). The time from onset to the diagnosis of PNES was 4.5 years. Epilepsy comorbidity was diagnosed in 9 patients (37.5%). The average time of use of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the group of isolated PNES was 2.4 years and 20% of patients were treated with two or more AED. The vast majority of patients presented with bilateral convulsions (54.16%) with apparent loss of consciousness found in 91.6% of cases. Ictal iwury (16.7%), tongue bite (4.2%) and premonition of the seizure (17.4%) were uncommon. Variability in clinical presentation of seizures was found in over half of patients (57%). Psychological trigger could be determined in over 60% of patients. EEG findings in a group with isolated PNES suggesting the existence of epileptiform activity was found in one case. EEG monitoring of placebo-induced seizure was performed in 20 patients, of whom 19 (95%) showed typical habitual attack with no electroclinical correlate. In 70% of cases conversion disorder DSM-IV criteria were fulfilled. Somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder were found in 3 patients. The diagnosis of factitious disorder was made in one case and only two patients were undiagnosed according to DSM-IV. DISCUSSION Average delay from onset to diagnosis of PNES in larger studies was estimated to be approximately 7 years [8]. Even though diagnostic delay in our study was shorter, organizational reasons for this could not be found. Longer duration of a typical attack (compared to the epileptic seizure), apparent loss of consciousness, bilateral convulsion behavior and significant clinical variability in absence of typical epileptic elements such as tongue bite and ictal iwury could be the main clinical manifestation of PNES. We found rare interictal abnormalities (6.7%) in the group with isolated PNES and significant percentage (77.7%) in patients with coexisting epilepsy which is coherent with other reports [8]. The latest could lead to prolonged delay in appropriate diagnosis and suitable treatment. Clear psychological trigger wasn't noted in whole group of patients (61 %). This, however, is not unusual since PNES represents a chronic disorder with repeated triggering that could lead to less significant role of the same psychological trigger in developed PNES. Even insufficiently resolved in ethical terms, placebo-induced procedure was of huge sensitivity. In clinical practice conversion disorder is hard to differ from malingering or implementation of secondary gain. One could make the conclusion only on the basis of detailed and careful estimation of the symptoms developing context Conversion disorder is more prevalent among women (from 2:1 to 10:1) [4, 13] but modest percentage of affected men could be explained only by limited sample in this study. CONCLUSION PNES is often replaced with epilepsy and in number of cases clinical differentiation is not easy. One should be acquainted with clinical presentation of PNES as well as its psychiatric origin in order to adequately recognize and treat the disorder.",

Primary insomnia is a dyssomnia characterized by a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep and the absence of restorative sleep that lasts for at least 1 month. The polysomnographic test shows alterations in the induction, continuity and structure of sleep. Primary insomnia typically begins in young adulthood, has a chronic course, and it is more prevalent among women. Its prevalence among patients with chronic insomnia ranges from 12.5% to 22.2%. Primary insomnia must be distinguished from insomnia related to inadequate sleep hygiene or another mental disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. The treatment of primary insomnia consists of nonpharmacological strategies (sleep hygiene, behavior-cognitive therapy) and sleep-promoting medication (e.g. hypnotics). Few differences exist between benzodiazepines, zopiclone and zolpidem in terms of effectiveness in inducing and maintaining sleep. However, in contrast to benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone do not suppress slow-wave sleep. Rebound insomnia and drug addiction are uncommon. Resumo Summary",

      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

      "title": "Concurrent medication and the neuromuscular junction",
      "abstract": "Introduction Many patients present for anaesthesia with disease processes that may be associated with or unrelated to the surgical condition. Epilepsy, bronchial asthma, peptic ulcer, manic and depressive illness, angina pectoris and essential hypertension are common in any population group. Such patients are often on medications for prolonged periods. Furthermore, antibiotics, diuretics, corticosteroids and immuno-suppressants are in frequent use and are often required as a part of the surgical procedure. The administration of anaesthesia may require the use of muscle relaxants. Concurrent medication has the potential to interfere with neuromuscular function and thus create an unexpected response to muscle relaxants. The effects of long-term medications on the neuromuscular junction and the possible effects on the action of muscle relaxants are discussed in this review according to their site of action (see Table 1). We have not considered the effects of drugs administered to produce the anaesthetic state (e.g. inhalational anaesthetics or local anaesthetic agents) or medications used for acute interventions during anaesthesia or surgery (e.g. sympathomimetic amines or ion exchange resins), which may also produce effects at the neuromuscular junction.Table 1: Sites of alteration of neuromuscular function by to concurrent medication Prejunctional effects, cAMP production Aminophylline Large doses of pancuronium (5 mg h−1) were required to stop spontaneous respiratory efforts and terminate restlessness in a 17-year-old male with bronchial asthma receiving large doses of aminophylline and corticosteroids. The authors speculated that aminophylline, which is a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, raised the level of cAMP, which in turn raised the amount of ACh at the neuromuscular junction, thus antagonizing the blocking effect of pancuronium [1]. Evidence for a prejunctional role of cyclic nucleotides in neuromuscular transmission was suggested by Dretchen and colleagues in 1976 [2]. It is likely that patients receiving prolonged aminophylline therapy in the upper therapeutic range may show an impaired response to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. This abnormal response has not been quantified, however, with respect to doses or durations of therapy for these agents. Azathioprine In concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 μg kg−1, administered intra-arterially in the in vivo cat soleus muscle preparation, azathioprine caused motor axons to fire repetitively and produced a dose-related increase in the force of contraction. Azathioprine reversed a neuromuscular block produced by tubocurarine and potentiated a neuromuscular block produced by suxamethonium. It was concluded that the effects of azathioprine on neuromuscular transmission result from inhibition of phosphodiesterase in the motor nerve terminal [3]. Diuretics Diuretics, in particular frusemide, have differing effects on non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. At low doses(0.1-10 μg kg−1), frusemide had a depressant effect, reducing the force of muscle contraction and intensifying the neuromuscular block produced by tubocurarine and suxamethonium in an in vitro rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation and an in vivo soleus nerve muscle preparation [4]. In contrast, higher doses(1-4 mg kg−1) antagonized a tubocurarine and suxamethonium block. High doses of frusemide inhibit non-competitively both the high- and the low-affinity forms of phosphodiesterase in both soluble and particulate fractions of cat sciatic nerve. This leads to an increase in the amount of ACh at the neuromuscular junction. Loss of potassium induced by thiazide diuretics may be important. Hypokalaemia produces increased sensitivity to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, although it is the ratio of intra- to extracellular potassium that is important and not the absolute value of either. The cell membrane becomes hyperpolarized, and there is resistance to the action of ACh. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are potentiated, and depolarizers may be antagonized [5]. Low doses of frusemide and thiazide diuretics are likely to potentiate the block produced by non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, whereas high doses of frusemide may antagonize a non-depolarizing block. Aminoglycoside antibiotics The anaesthetist frequently encounters patients on prophylactic antibiotics and often administers antibiotics in the perioperative period [6]. Several antibiotics have been shown to enhance the neuromuscular block produced by non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents [7]. Prominent among these are the aminoglycosides. All the aminoglycosides are capable of causing neuromuscular block and alone result in paralysis. The mechanism appears to involve inhibition of calcium uptake, which results in both reduction in presynaptic ACh release and block of post-synaptic ACh receptors [8]. The aminoglycosides differ in their presynaptic and postsynaptic effects [9, 10]. The effects of seven antibiotics (streptomycin, amikacin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline) were compared with those of Mg2+, tubocurarine and lignocaine in the frog sciatic nerve-sartorius muscle preparation [11]. All except tubocurarine decreased end-plate potential quantal content. Neomycin is capable of producing respiratory arrest by blocking neuromuscular transmission by a presynaptic mechanism [12]. Aminoglycosides have prejunctional effects, similar to magnesium, resulting in decreased release of ACh [13]. Dibekacin and sisomycin block the neuromuscular junction and are associated with the disappearance of action potentials and a decrease in the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials. These effects were augmented by the use of MgCl2. Factors known to enhance neuromuscular block in the presence of aminoglycosides include the curare-like drugs, magnesium and botulinum toxin. Patients who have received large doses of aminoglycoside administered into the peritoneal or pleural space, which can lead to high peak serum concentrations following absorption from these spaces, are also susceptible. The neuromuscular paralysis can be prevented or reversed by providing additional calcium intravenously [8]. Critically ill patients requiring prolonged ventilatory care and coincident treatment with aminoglycoside antibiotics and steroids are at particular risk. Pancuronium and vecuronium are reported to have caused a myopathy [14], although neither the mechanism nor the validity of the association with steroidal relaxants is known at present. Muscle dysfunction is a common feature of critical illness, and it is possible that neuromuscular blocking drugs may interfere with muscle repair and that these effects are compounded by aminoglycoside antibiotics and large doses of corticosteroids. Hasfurther and Bailey [15] reported failure of reversal after rocuronium in a patient who had received oral neomycin in anticipation of open bowel resection. It is well established that the administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics will cause a prolongation of the action of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, owing to both pre- and post-synaptic effects of the antibiotics at the neuromuscular junction. Calcium channel-blocking drugs Calcium channel-blocking drugs are widely used in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, bronchospasm associated with exercise-induced asthma and the treatment of oesophageal spasms [16]. A patient known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy on long-term verapamil, 40 mg three times a day, was given pancuronium 2 mg and tubocurarine 5 mg for muscle relaxation for an elective cholecystectomy. Approximately 2.5 h after initial administration, there was a profound degree of muscle paralysis with no third twitch in the train-of-four. Antagonism of the block was attempted with neostigmine 2.5 mg and atropine 1.2 mg. After 6 min, there was no change in the degree of residual block with no return of the third or fourth twitch and no significant alteration of the height in the first or second twitch [17]. Similar reports of prolonged duration of action of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants have appeared in the literature [18,19]. The effects of four organic calcium channel antagonists (nicardipine, nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil) on the neuromuscular blocking activities of tubocurarine, suxamethonium, decamethonium and neomycin were studied in isolated mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations [20]. The effective concentration of suxamethonium for 50% inhibition of single indirect twitch responses was reduced threefold when the preparations were pretreated with calcium channel antagonists at 10 μmol. The neuromuscular blocking effect of decamethonium was also enhanced to a similar degree. In a similar study with nicardipine, verapamil and diltiazem, each of which caused a concentration-related depression in muscle response, nicardipine had the most and diltiazem the least effect [21]. It has been suggested that calcium channel antagonists are endowed with the unique capability to affect the post-synaptic nicotinic ACh receptor allosterically, thus promoting its desensitization [20]. This view supported the work of Adam and Henderson in 1986 [22] who found that certain calcium channel antagonists significantly potentiated the block of endplate currents produced by suxamethonium at concentrations at which the calcium channel antagonists themselves had no effect on end-plate currents. Rooke et al. in 1994 [23] found that patients receiving chronic calcium channel antagonist therapy are at no greater risk of hyperkalaemia after suxamethonium than those not taking such medication. Intravenous verapamil (0.2 mg kg−1) reduced by 25% and 30%, respectively, the dose of atracurium required to produce a 50% or 95% neuromuscular block. In contrast, diltiazem (1 mg kg−1) failed to produce significant changes [24]. Nicardipine decreased significantly the vecuronium requirement in a dose-dependent manner at doses of 1, 2 and 3 μmol kg−1 min−1. Nicardipine also reduced both the plasma concentration of vecuronium to maintain 90% depression and the total plasma clearance of vecuronium. The results of Kawabata et al.[25] indicate that vecuronium infusion dose requirements are reduced by as much as 53% after a clinical dose of nicardipine. However, Bell et al.[26] found that neither the time to onset of maximum block nor the duration of clinical relaxation differed significantly between patients receiving chronic nifedipine therapy when given atracurium and vecuronium. Neostigmine 10−6 mol L−1 did not produce any significant changes in the maximal recovery of twitch depression induced with calcium channel blockers and muscle relaxants in combination, and neostigmine also had no effect on maximal recovery time of twitch depression [27]. Although there have been contradictory reports, vigilance is advised regarding potential problems resulting from the interaction of both depolarizing and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents with concurrent calcium channel blocker therapy. Lithium Lithium and sodium are in the same group of the Periodic Table and share similar physical properties. Lithium is transported into the cell with sodium during cellular depolarization. Lithium influx is about 70% of that of sodium, and extrusion from the cell occurs at only 10% of the rate of sodium. Intracellular accumulation of lithium may reduce resting membrane potential (more positive), which could in turn reduce the height of the action potentials and reduce the effectiveness of the Na+:K+ pump. At concentrations above 2 mmol L−1, lithium produces somnolence, lethargy, muscle weakness, stupor and coma. When animals were chronically pretreated with lithium, there was a slight reduction in the dosage requirement for tubocurarine. At concentrations well above therapeutic serum levels, indirect and direct twitch responses were depressed [28]. In a study on the isolated rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparation, lithium led to significant enhancement of the myoneural blocking effects of suxamethonium, pancuronium and vecuronium [29]. Prolonged treatment of rats with lithium inhibited the increase in the number of extra junctional ACh receptors that occurred in denervated skeletal muscle. In normal muscle, lithium reduces the number of ACh receptors at the neuromuscular junction. These changes appear to be relatively specific for lithium [30]. In the 1970s, two case reports described prolonged neuromuscular block; in patients receiving lithium therapy, one after suxamethonium and the other after pancuronium [31,32]. There had been a previous report of abnormal recovery following an anaesthetic with methohexitone and suxamethonium (30 mg) in a patient with a serum lithium concentration of 3.4 mmol L−1[33]. It was suggested that lithium should be discontinued for at least 24 h before anaesthesia. The effects of lithium on transmitter release are not clear. The primary mechanism of block by lithium may result from decreased transmitter release and reduced excitability of the presynaptic terminals [34]. However, there have been reports showing that lithium stimulated the secretion of ACh [35,36]. Even though the presynaptic effects of lithium, particularly on ACh release, are not clearly defined, it seems very likely, from the available evidence, that the effects of muscle relaxants are likely to be enhanced during chronic lithium therapy. At therapeutic levels, there appears to be only a minimal interaction with competitive neuromuscular blocking agents. The reduction in post-synaptic nicotinic receptor turnover and density during chronic lithium therapy, along with the reduction in the efficacy of the Na+:K+ pump, are important factors in increasing the sensitivity to muscle relaxants. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic range, and high plasma levels cause muscle weakness. Patients on lithium therapy are required to maintain adequate sodium and fluid intake. Alterations in lithium levels may occur during disease, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract. The British National Formulary suggests that lithium should be stopped for 2 days before major surgery, but the normal dose can be continued for minor surgery [37]. It is recommended that there is close monitoring of fluids and electrolytes and that lithium levels be measured before the administration of muscle relaxants to patients on lithium. Magnesium Magnesium is a physiological calcium antagonist, and there is a correlation between the depression of neuromuscular transmission and serum magnesium concentration. The depression of neuromuscular transmission actually has a better correlation with the serum Mg2+:Ca2+ ratio than with the serum magnesium concentration itself. Magnesium sulphate is used increasingly in the treatment of pre-eclampsia, endocrine crises (e.g. phaeochromocytoma) and in cardiac surgery. This has significant implications for anaesthesia because of its interaction with neuromuscular blockers [38,39]. Magnesium sulphate causes a dose-related depression of ACh release by competition with Ca2+ at the presynaptic membrane and in the sarcoplasm of the muscle. There is a significant correlation between the Ca2+:Mg2+ ratio and the effect produced at the neuromuscular junction [40,41]. There is a reduction in twitch response that will potentiate the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Unlike non-depolarizing blocking drugs, however, magnesium decreases twitch response without tetanic or TOF fade. The effect of magnesium sulphate is only partially reversed by Ca2+, suggesting that alternative mechanisms of action may exist. In the presence of suxamethonium, magnesium hastens the development of phase 2 block [42]. After treatment with magnesium sulphate, an increase in the degree of block and a prolonged duration of action of vecuronium has been noted. Kwan et al. in 1996 [43] reported a case in which 1 mg of vecuronium lasted 4 h in a patient treated with magnesium sulphate for severe pre-eclampsia, whose serum Mg2+ level was in the therapeutic range. Magnesium sulphate in 60 mg kg−1 doses administered at recovery from vecuronium block, at a train-of-four ratio of 0.7, caused rapid and profound recurarization [44]. In a pregnant patient with an open eye injury, who was receiving i.v. magnesium 2 g hourly during preterm labour, rocuronium produced a fourfold increase in the duration of neuromuscular block [45]. Where suxamethonium is concerned, the situation is less clear. There was no significant increase in serum K+ concentration after pretreatment with magnesium sulphate before suxamethonium administration [46]. In one study, in the cat, antagonism between suxamethonium and Mg2+ was demonstrated [47]. A bolus of magnesium sulphate may reduce the hypertensive response to laryngoscopy and intubation [48]. Patients receiving magnesium therapy are likely to have a prolonged response to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants; the increase in duration of paralysis may be as much as fourfold. Anticonvulsants Patients chronically receiving anticonvulsants are resistant to competitive neuromuscular blockers [49]. Acutely administered phenytoin enhances a pre-existing non-depolarizing block [50]. In this group, phenytoin was administered intravenously in a dose of 10 mg kg−1 to a group of patients in whom steady-state neuromuscular block had been established with an infusion of vecuronium. There was an increase in block at 30 and 45 min after the start of the phenytoin infusion. This observation agrees with previous animal work, which had shown a direct neuromuscular blocking action of phenytoin [51]. In a study with patients chronically receiving anticonvulsants, those receiving phenytoin recovered more quickly from a vecuronium-induced block. The recovery index in the phenytoin group was 7.9±2.2 min compared with 17.8±5.1 min in the control group. The total duration of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block was significantly shorter in the phenytoin group (31.9±6 min compared with 69.7 ± 12.9 min in the control group). However, the time to maximum block and recovery from atracurium was unaffected by phenytoin therapy. The mechanism of action of phenytoin on the neuromuscular junction appears to be complex. There have been reports showing a post-junctional effect, a pre-junctional effect and a reduction in synthesis of ACh [52]. Phenytoin also has a stabilizing effect on neuronal membranes related to its action on the transcellular flux of sodium, potassium and calcium ions [53]. Decreased sensitivity to metocurine during long-term phenytoin therapy may also be attributable to altered protein binding and ACh receptor changes [54]. Gray et al.[50] suggested that, as vecuronium is 90% protein bound and phenytoin is 80% protein bound, an increased concentration of free active drug after displacement of vecuronium from protein binding sites may be a factor in the increased neuromuscular block after acute phenytoin therapy. The explanation for the resistance to neuromuscular block observed after chronic phenytoin therapy is not clear. Norris et al.[51] reported muscle weakness, which improved after chronic phenytoin therapy was stopped. In 1997, Hans et al.[55] showed that anticonvulsant therapy increased plasma alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels independent of the plasma anticonvulsant level. However, duration and recovery of vecuronium-induced block did not correlate with plasma AAG levels, and it was concluded that elevated AAG did not contribute to the resistance to vecuronium-induced block by anticonvulsants. There have been reports of prolonged onset time and accelerated recovery from pipecuronium in patients treated with chronic anticonvulsant therapy [56,57]. Chronic treatment with anticonvulsants also resulted in more rapid recovery from a neuromuscular block produced by doxacurium and metocurine [58]. Even though there is resistance to pancuronium in patients receiving carbamazepine [59], prior chronic carbamazepine therapy did not influence mivacurium-induced neuromuscular block [60]. However, resistance to rocuronium in an epileptic patient on long-term carbamazepine therapy has been reported [61]. In patients receiving long-term treatment with phenytoin or carbamazepine, three possible mechanisms for resistance to non-depolarizers are reported: (1) increased hepatic metabolism and clearance by enzyme induction; (2) an increase in protein binding resulting in a decreased free fraction of the drug; and (3) decreased ACh receptor sensitivity with subsequent upregulation of the ACh receptor [62-64]. A decreased duration of action of rocuronium in a patient with renal failure on chronic phenytoin therapy has also been reported [65]. Loan and colleagues [66] found a reduction in the duration of action of rocuronium in patients receiving carbamazepine alone or in combination with other anticonvulsants. The actions of atracurium and mivacurium are not affected by co-medication with phenytoin or carbamazepine [67]. In a study of the in vitro neuromuscular effects of valproic acid on the rat neuromuscular junction [68], significant block did not occur. The partial block that was produced was caused predominantly by a direct inhibitory effect of valproic acid on the muscle itself. However, it has been suggested that valproic acid may cause upregulation of the ACh receptor, as acute administration in animals causes partial neuromuscular block and potentiates the effects of neuromuscular blocking drugs [63]. Driessen et al.[69] reported accelerated recovery from rocuronium in an end-stage renal failure patient on chronic anticonvulsant therapy with sodium valproate and primidone. After suxamethonium, there have been observations of prolonged duration of action (14.3±2.3 min in anticonvulsant-treated patients compared with 10.0±1.6 min in a control group), which was attributed to anticonvulsant-induced upregulation of post-synaptic ACh receptors [70]. It has also been shown that phenytoin reduces suxamethonium-induced myalgia [71]. Resistance or decreased sensitivity to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants in patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy is reasonably well established. A similar response may occur in patients on chronic carbamazepine therapy. In contrast, acute administration of phenytoin is likely to enhance a non-depolarizing block. The effect of valproic acid is uncertain, but it is known to have a direct inhibitory effect on muscle. Effect on ACh release Botulinum toxin Botulinum toxin is known to block ACh release at the neuromuscular junction [72]. Botulinum neurotoxin type A, a di-chain protein produced by Clostridium botulinum, blocks ACh release from peripheral nerves by binding to the terminals, undergoing internalization and proteolysing a protein essential for exocytosis [73]. Perie et al.[74] concluded that the intracellular target of botulinum neurotoxin A is a protein of the ACh vesicle membrane. The toxin has been used for periocular injections in patients with blepharospasm [75]. When used for focal dystonias, botulinum toxin may cause a transient impairment of neuromuscular transmission in muscles distant from those injected. Fiacchino et al.[76] described a patient who underwent general anaesthesia twice during treatment with botulinum toxin. The patient's sensitivity to vecuronium was low 90 days after the seventh treatment with toxin and normal 8 days after the ninth treatment. It is possible that repeated treatments with the toxin may cause continuous remodelling of neuromuscular junctions and may cause the patient to develop some tolerance to the action of neuromuscular blockers. Chloroquine Chloroquine has a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking action and can have an additive effect on non-depolarizing muscle relaxants used during anaesthesia. Chloroquine has been shown to generate ACh receptor antibodies [77]. Chloroquine also has a local anaesthetic-like effect on the membranes of axons and muscle fibres, which results in a reduction in transmitter output and a decrease in the amplitude of the action potentials of the muscle fibres [78]. Chloroquine induced myasthenic syndrome [79], in a patient taking the drug for presumed reticular erythematous mucinosis, was probably caused by a direct effect of chloroquine on the neuromuscular junction. The generalized myasthenic syndrome was responsive to i.v. edrophonium. The syndrome was rapidly reversible, as clinical and electrophysiological recovery was documented 4 days after discontinuation of chloroquine therapy, and recovery was complete in 11 days. From the available evidence, it is likely that chronic chloroquine therapy will prolong the effect of non-depolarizing block. Quinidine and procainamide Quinidine, a potent antiarrhythmic drug, is used to treat both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Quinidine potentiates both depolarizing and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. Kambam et al.[80] observed desensitization block and prolongation of a suxamethonium block in a patient receiving quinidine preoperatively. It was concluded that the principal mechanism for this was depression of plasma cholinesterase activity. Miller et al.[81] studied the interaction between quinidine and neuromuscular blockers in the cat anterior tibialis and the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. The neuromuscular block produced by tubocurarine, suxamethonium and gallamine was doubled in intensity and duration after quinidine. Edrophonium was not completely effective in antagonizing a block produced by quinidine. Posttetanic facilitation with non-depolarizing blockers is decreased after quinidine. Procainamide and quinidine also possess local anaesthetic properties. These anti-arrhythmics may potentiate neuromuscular block by interfering with the release of ACh [82] and by impairing transmission at nerve terminals. Local anaesthetics are also known to displace muscle relaxants, which are bound to plasma proteins, thus providing increased concentrations of the muscle relaxant at the myoneural junction. Harrah et al.[83] reported that procainamide, lignocaine and propranolol increased the intensity and duration of a tubocurarine block. It has been suggested that procainamide and quinidine cause clinically significant potentiation of non-depolarizing drugs because of their AChR channel-blocking activity [84]. Effect in the synaptic cleft Bambuterol Bambuterol is an inactive prodrug that is slowly converted in the body to its active form terbutaline. The carbonate groups that are split off can selectively inhibit plasma cholinesterase. Oral administration of bambuterol has been reported to augment a suxamethonium block [85,86]. A mivacurium block may be similarly augmented, especially in patients with a heterozygous abnormality of plasma cholinesterase [87]. Clonidine Administration of the alpha 2 agonist clonidine has the ability to reduce the anaesthetic requirements of traditional agents by as much as 50% [88]. Conflicting reports have appeared regarding the effects of clonidine on a vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block [89,90]. The clinical duration of a bolus of vecuronium 0.1 mg kg−1 was measured in a group of patients who received clonidine, 4.0-5.5 mm kg−1 orally 90 min before arriving in the operating room and compared with a control group receiving no premedication. The time to recovery to 25% of the control (first twitch in the train-of-four sequence) after vecuronium was significantly longer in the clonidine group (51.2±7.5 min compared with 40.5±5.1 min in the control group) and was probably caused by a pharmacokinetic interaction [89]. Substance B, a chemical isolated from brain, reverses presynaptically modulated inhibition of evoked ACh release. Inhibitory modulating agents whose activity is reversed by substance B included clonidine [91]. No difference between clonidine-treated and control patients in onset time, duration or recovery index of neuromuscular block from vecuronium has been reported [90]. Although clonidine interferes with ACh release, its effect at the neuromuscular junction has not been quantified, and its effect on the action of muscle relaxants remains uncertain. Cyclophosphamide In 1995, Vigouroux and Voltaire [92] reported a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after mivacurium for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a 45-year-old patient treated with cyclophosphamide for Wegener's granulomatosis. The duration of action of an intubating dose of 0.2 mg kg−1 of mivacurium was 75 min. Additional bolus doses of 1 mg (25% of the maintenance dose) every 10-15 min were sufficient for maintaining relaxation. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase activity was reduced by 50%. Cholinesterase inhibition from cyclophosphamide could be a significant factor. Ecothiopate Ecothiopate is a potent long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of glaucoma. In addition to its local effect in the eye, systemic absorption is sufficient to produce a decrease in plasma cholinesterase activity. The fall in activity of plasma cholinesterase is rapid in the first 2 weeks, and levels of less than 5% of normal have been reported in patients receiving ecothiopate eye drops for a prolonged period of time. After the cessation of therapy, it takes 4 weeks for the plasma cholinesterase levels to return to normal. Pantuck [93] reported an extended response to suxamethonium in a patient receiving ecothiopate eye drops. Prolonged apnoea after suxamethonium was reported by Gesztes [94]. Muscle relaxation can be achieved safely with suxamethonium in patients with decreased plasma cholinesterase activity if neuromuscular function is monitored closely [95]. In a study performed by Kraunak et al.[96], ecothiopate had no significant effect on the potentiation of suxamethonium caused by anaesthetic drugs. The manufacturers of mivacurium advise that this drug should not be used in the presence of ecothiopate because of the unpredictable duration of action after the suppression of plasma cholinesterase activity. H2 receptor antagonists H2 receptor antagonists are used extensively for the treatment and prevention of oesophageal and gastroduodenal ulcer disease. An extensive range of proprietary medicines are available over the counter. Both cimetidine (5 mmol L−1) and ranitidine (1 mmol L−1) have been shown to potentiate the effect of ACh on the toad rectus abdominis muscle 4 and 2.6 times, respectively, when compared with saline [97]. Increasing doses of the drugs did not produce muscle contracture as did suxamethonium, but there was a concentration-dependent and non-parallel shift of the ACh response curve together with a reduction in maximal response, suggesting a non-depolarizing mechanism of action, possibly resulting from ion channel block. Cimetidine and ranitidine both produce an immediate and prolonged effect on the neuromuscular block in rats receiving suxamethonium infusions [98]. The degree of non-competitive block produced by H2 receptor antagonists has been the subject of several studies [99,100]. Anticholinesterase activity has been attributed to cimetidine and ranitidine, although there is no clinical relevance in the parturient [101] or in patients presenting for elective surgery [102]. Ulsamer [103] found that the time from injection of vecuronium to neuromuscular recovery was significantly prolonged after 5 mg kg−1 cimetidine. It has also been suggested that interaction between cimetidine and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants occurs at the presynaptic level, because experimental investigation has shown calcium to reverse the effects of cimetidine [104]. The neuromuscular blocking action of tubocurarine was potentiated at high concentrations of nizatidine and ranitidine, while it was antagonized at lower doses [105]. However, McCarthy et al.[106] found no differences in non-depolarizing block after pretreatment with ranitidine or cimetidine. Chronic exposure to cimetidine or ranitidine at human therapeutic concentrations in rats does not affect the neuromuscular pharmacodynamics of suxamethonium or atracurium [107]. Intravenous famotidine at human therapeutic doses fails to alter neuromuscular function in vivo[108]. Exposure to cimetidine has no effect on neuromuscular block from rocuronium [109]. These conflicting reports do not permit a clear conclusion on the effect of H2 receptor antagonists on the neuromuscular junction. The anticholinesterase effect of H2 antagonists in the doses used in clinical practice is unlikely to have an effect on muscle relaxants. With non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, potentiation occurs only at very high concentrations, much above therapeutic levels. However, individual variations may occur during the use of muscle relaxants in patients on long-term treatment with H2 receptor antagonists. Pyridostigmine Anticholinesterase therapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients suffering from myasthenia gravis. The use of suxamethonium in these patients may have variable effects [110]. There is a documented resistance to onset of depolarizing block in patients who are maintained on their anticholinesterase therapy preoperatively [111]. Reduced metabolism of the depolarizing drugs results in a propensity for prolonged recovery and the development of phase 2 block [112]. There does, however, seem to be little correlation between plasma cholinesterase activity and the duration of block [113]. Mivacurium has been used successfully in myasthenic patients in a dose that was half the recommended ED95. This resulted in a 93% block of T1 with a prolonged recovery index (25-75% T1) of 20.5 min, and subsequent antagonism with neostigmine was uncomplicated [114]. However, Fleming and Lewis [115] showed no increase in duration of action with mivacurium when used in rats treated with pyridostigmine and suggested that increased competition at the neuromuscular junction, following pretreatment with anticholinesterase agents, has a more marked effect on duration of action than inhibition of plasma cholinesterase. Preoperative use of pyridostigmine has also been shown to reduce the neuromuscular block produced by vecuronium [116]. Tacrine Tacrine is a powerful anticholinesterase inhibitor that prolongs the duration of action of suxamethonium-induced neuromuscular block and may lead to phase 2 block [117,118]. This interaction was used clinically before the introduction of short-acting non-depolarizing agents [119]. Tacrine is currently being investigated for use in patients with Alzheimer's disease [120], and this important interaction may be encountered more frequently. Post-synaptic effect β-Receptor blocking drugs There have been reports of prolonged response to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs in patients receiving atenolol or propranolol [83,121,122]. It is difficult to explain this interaction in terms of neuromuscular conduction and block, although it is known that propranolol possesses local anaesthetic properties and may interfere with the propagation of the nerve action potential. It is also possible that a pharmokinetic effect is involved. Benzodiazepines There have been conflicting reports on the interactions of benzodiazepines with muscle relaxants. In 1970, Feldman and Crawley [123] suggested that diazepam interacted with muscle relaxant drugs. Diazepam alone has no effect on the response of the tibialis anterior muscle to indirect stimulation in dogs and, in a bolus dose of 5 mg, does not influence a pre-existing partial block by tubocurarine, gallamine or pancuronium [124]. The degree and duration of block by tubocurarine was not affected significantly by simultaneous administration of diazepam in man. In a review of the literature by Martins [125] in 1975, it was concluded that diazepam exerts a possible sparing effect on the dose of muscle relaxants of between 8% and 30%. It was concluded that diazepam in therapeutic doses did not affect neuromuscular transmission and that this sparing effect did not result from a direct pharmacological interaction nor an effect on skeletal muscle fibres. This sparing effect of diazepam was thought most probably to be caused by a summation of muscle relaxant actions exerted at different levels of the nervous system (spinal and brainstem levels), resulting in inhibition of polysynaptic reflex activity, enhancement of presynaptic inhibition and depression of gamma motor neurone activity. Experimental work has shown that, at low concentrations (1-100 μg mL−1), diazepam increased the twitch contractions in response to motor nerve stimulation in the chick and rat in a dose-dependent manner [126]. Higher concentrations decreased twitch tension and greatly reduced the contractions produced by ACh and tetraethylammonium in chick skeletal muscle. However, in a dose of 0.15 mg kg−1, diazepam had no significant effect on the neuromuscular block produced by either tubocurarine or suxamethonium. It was concluded that diazepam may either increase or decrease the twitch tension in rat and chick skeletal muscle, the effect being dependent on the concentrations used. Similar results were obtained by Driessen et al.[127]. At present, the consensus is that benzodiazepines, in concentrations achieved during normal therapy, do not influence a neuromuscular block. Lincosamides The pre- and post-junctional effects of the lincosamide antibiotics clindamycin and lincomycin have been studied in animals [128]. Lincomycin and clindamycin appeared to produce muscle paralysis by different mechanisms. Clindamycin exerts a direct depressant action on muscle contractility, whereas lincomycin primarily depresses neuromuscular transmission [129]. Wright and Collier [130] demonstrated that the direct depressant action on muscle contractility by clindamycin was fivefold more potent than that of lincomycin. Rubbo and colleagues [131] observed that lincomycin decreased ACh release, while clindamycin increased it. The antagonism by neostigmine and calcium of a clindamycin-augmented non-depolarizing blockade in man may be incomplete [132]. The latter results suggested that the neuromuscular blocking effects of clindamycin involve primarily a post-junctional mechanism, whereas the effects of lincomycin are both pre- and post-junctional. In 1993, de Gouw et al.[133] concluded that the administration of colistin and clindamycin may cause a significant prolongation of an already long-acting neuromuscular block. Unknown site of action Penicillin The neuroexcitatory and depressant effects of penicillin at the animal soleus neuromuscular junction was studied by Raines and Dretchen [134]. Post-tetanic potentiation in this system, which is mediated by repetitive discharges originating in nerve terminals after high-frequency stimulation, is augmented by penicillin. Larger doses depressed post-tetanic stimulation, and still larger doses produced varying degrees of neuromuscular block. Only extremely large doses of penicillin will produce any effect on neuromuscular block, and this is unlikely to be encountered in clinical practice. Metronidazole Metronidazole has been reported to facilitate neuromuscular transmission and to antagonize tubocurarine-induced neuromuscular block partially in isolated rat diaphragm [135]. However, in cats, metronidazole was observed to potentiate the effects of vecuronium after 1 h of administration. The potentiating action of metronidazole seen with vecuronium was not reproducible when pancuronium was used, suggesting that it was not an effect of metronidazole on neuromuscular transmission. It may be secondary to an effect of metronidazole on the distribution or metabolism of vecuronium. The slow onset of the effect of metronidazole on the neuromuscular junction suggests that the effect may be brought about by a metabolite rather than by metronidazole itself. Caution may be necessary when vecuronium is administered to patients treated with metronidazole [136]. Corticosteroids The effect of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, methyl prednisolone) on the recovery time from vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block was studied using evoked potential measurements following stimulation of the ulnar nerve [137]. Recovery time was prolonged by corticosteroids and, in the case of hydrocortisone, this effect was significant. It was speculated that corticosteroids reduced the clearance of vecuronium. Prolongation of recovery time from vecuronium-induced block after the administration of corticosteroids may be explained not only by the direct effects of hydrocortisone on the neuromuscular junction but also by the effect of hydrocortisone on the elimination of vecuronium from plasma. In the cat, hydrocortisone in 7-15 mg kg−1 doses significantly enhanced the 50% depression of the indirectly elicited twitch tension of the tibialis anterior muscle produced by an i.v. infusion of pancuronium [138]. It is uncertain as to the doses of corticosteroids that may affect neuromuscular function. It is likely that chronic high-dose corticosteroid therapy may prolong the duration of action of vecuronium and pancuronium. Tamoxifen Tamoxifen has been reported to prolong block after the administration of atracurium, but the mechanism is not known [139]. Conclusion Medications in use for disease states commonly encountered in any population group may have the potential to alter function at the neuromuscular junction. We have reviewed the possible effects of drugs that are in common usage, often chronically, on neuromuscular junctional activity. Much of the evidence for the effects of drugs on the neuromuscular junction comes from animal experiments, often with doses not used in clinical practice. It is noteworthy that, despite the extremely wide use of these drugs, the incidence in the literature of prolonged or adverse interactions with neuromuscular blocking agents is sparse. This could result from either difficulty in establishing the diagnosis or the rarity of clinically important events. The determination of the role of concurrent medication in producing an unpredicted neuromuscular block usually follows a process of elimination, often after the problem has resolved. Thus, knowledge of the possibilities provides awareness of potential problems during clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Implicit in the phenomenon of stereotyped behaviour is a puzzle: the term stereotype applies to a behavioural act that is repeated again and again, but unlike a motivated act, it makes no sense because it does not seem to achieve an adaptive outcome: Drug-induced stereotypy, such as that produced by high doses of central stimulants, has that character. The wide variety of seemingly unrelated independent stereotypies generated by central stimulants is also puzzling. In rodents, for instance, drugs such as apomorphine and amphetamine have been reported to elicit climbing, jumping, rearing, prancing, running, walking, circling, revolving, pivoting, gnawing, licking, nose-poking, sniffing, verticalization, side-to-side head and paw movements, backward locomotion, and underwater swimming without surfacing (e.g. Alander etal.1983; Cole 1977; Costall and Naylor 1973; Decsi et al.1979; Fray et al.1980; Janssen et al.1960; Jerussi and Glick 1976; Kokkinidis and Anisman 1979; Schijljrring 1971; Schoenfeld et al.1975; Segal et al.1980; Szechtman et al.1982; Teitelbaum 1986; Thomas and Handley 1978; Voigtlander eta/.1975).

Bhootonmada denotes a category of psychiatric/neuropsychiatric conditions assumed to be caused by affliction of evil spirits (bhuta/graha). Till date, no studies have been conducted on UG and it is unexplored. The present study is focused on the better understanding of UG and its clinical applicability. UG is characterized by features of Krodhanam (aggressiveness/impulsivity), Nishwasantam (hyperventilation/anxiety/phobia), Bhramantam (agitation/restlessness/hyperactivity), Trasyantam (startle response/hyperekplexia/anxiety/phobia), Raktaaksha (red eyes/Kayser–Fleischer rings), Stabdha drishtim (prolonged staring/abnormal eye movements), Jihwa lolayantam/Srikkinyau lihaan (facial tics), Sarpavat prasarati/Adhomukha shaayinam (athetosis/chorea/motor tics/opisthotonus), Chalam/Vakra gamanam (gait abnormalities), Ksheera, ghrita, guda, and madhu priyam (craving for sweets), Snaana maalya priyam (obsessive-compulsive features), Gaatraani kampayantam (tremors/motor tics/seizures), Dantai khaadantam (self-injurious behaviors/oromandibular dystonia/bruxism), Nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive daytime sleepiness), etc.. The clinical picture of UG shows similarity with various \"extrapyramidal movement disorders\" and also with \"Tourette syndrome-plus.\"",

      "abstract": "Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is a rare and underreported phenomenon. When patients ingest large amounts of cocaine, patients can experience seizures. Despite returning to baseline after several days to weeks, patients can suddenly decompensate, exhibiting what is called postictal psychosis despite being abstinent from the substance. This condition can lead to chronic psychosis if not properly treated. In this case, a male in his twenties, presented with 1 month of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. After his last cocaine use 1 month ago, the patient developed seizure-like activity and shortly after returned to baseline. Approximately 1 week later, the patient started to experience psychosis. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted and started on Risperidone 2mg twice a day but did not respond. Clonazepam 1mg twice a day was added, which helped patient to return to baseline. Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is underreported, and it can be difficult to recognize. Similarly, there are few guidelines as to how to treat this condition. Clinicians need to rapidly address if they suspect that the patient is experiencing possible postictal psychosis given that this can lead to chronic psychosis.",

      "title": "[Drug interactions of methadone with CNS-active agents].",
      "abstract": "Psychoactive medication is frequently used in methadone maintenance treatment programs (MMP) to treat comorbid mental disorders (depression, anxiety, schizophrenia) in opiate-addicts. Thus, several pharmacological interactions are possible. This problem becomes more relevant with the introduction of new CNS-drugs like SSRI, atypical antipsychotics or new anticonvulsants. The most common interactions seen in practice are pharmacodynamic in nature, most often due to the cumulative effects of different drugs on the central nervous system (e.g. neuroleptics or benzodiazepine interactions). However important pharmacokinetic interactions may occur particularly between methadone and antidepressant drugs: Desipramine plasma levels are increased by methadone; further fluvoxamine (and fluoxetine to a less extent) may cause an important increase in serum methadone concentrations. The inhibition of different clusters of the cytochrome P450 system are involved in these interactions. Several lines of evidence suggest that benzodiazepines and methadone may have synergistic interactions and that opiate sedation or respiratory depression could be increased. This is a serious problem, given the widespread use of benzodiazepines among MMP patients. Experimental but not clinical data support methadone and lithium interactions. Finally, classic anticonvulsant drugs, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, produce dramatic decreases in methadone levels, which may precipitate a withdrawal syndrome; valproic acid and the new anticonvulsant drugs do not have these effects. Accordingly, caution is advised in the clinical use of methadone when other CNS-drugs are administered.",

They are used therapeutically for anxiety and insomnia and are used nonmedically for their psychoactive effects. An estimated 1.8 million Americans are current nonmedical users of sedatives. Many sedatives act on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, producing depressed cortical function and disinhibition. Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, and vasomotor collapse and may be fatal. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications. Prescribed sedatives can be tapered slowly over weeks to months. Acute withdrawal can be treated with a taper of a long-acting benzodiazepine or phenobarbital. There are few data on long-term treatment of sedative use disorders.",

It is more conflicting the data about if they can produce or unmask vulnerabilities to long term psychiatric disorders; or to affect its course and phenomenology; or to influence the response to the therapeutic resources used to treat them, beyond the period of abstinence. The objective is to update the knowledge available on the ability of the marijuana and the stimulants to produce long term psychiatric disorders, or to unmask vulnerabilities to them. We have done an electronic bibliographical research in MEDLINE using the following key words: psychiatric disorders, amphetamine, stimulants, marijuana, cannabis, long term effects, psychosis, cognitive and cognitive deficits. The marijuana might induce permanent psychosis in subjects with vulnerability to schizophrenia or to psychosis. The cognitive effects are acute and subacute, related with the presence of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the central nervous system. The stimulants can produce a schizophrenia-like psychosis, and they can produce long term cognitive deficits. The stimulants also might produce subsyndromic mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The core problem of addicts is addiction and not the other mental disorders that may be present. This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

Of these applications one of the more interesting fields of work at the moment is the use of relaxation training with cognitive behavioural procedures. This is particularly true of the application of these techniques to those hospital populations described as psychotic or retarded. It has been effectively shown that low intelligence does not preclude the use of these techniques (Mahoney and Mahoney, 1976) and workers have used progressive relaxation with desensitisation on the retarded with good results (Peck, 1976). There are also indications that relaxation sessions in themselves can have definite beneficial effects on psychotic symptomology (Slade, 1972).",

Although the neurotoxic effects produced by different cytostatics present a different appearance and are partly of only sporadic or slight clinical importance, there is hardly a cytostatic which does not exercise a side effect on the nervous system. Definition of the side effects in the nervous system which are caused by cytostatics, is often difficult, because the neurotoxic syndromes are similar to disease patterns of different origin, especially those of the neoplastic and paraneoplastic type, both topically and clinico-phenomenologically. However, it is often of vital importance to arrive at the correct diagnosis well in time, because this will help the physician to decide whether the cytostatic should be discontinued or administered as before. For this reason, it may be necessary to employ, besides the neuropsychiatric examination, additional electrophysiological, CSF-diagnostic, CT and bioptic methods.",

Les effets subjectifs et comportementaux qu’ils induisent sont très impressionnants, et malgré leur toxicité potentielle, le risque d’addiction est relativement faible par rapport à la nicotine, l’alcool ou les opiacés. Depuis la découverte des effets antidépresseurs de la kétamine, il existe un regain d’intérêt pour cette classe de molécules. En effet, la psilocybine et l’acide lysergique diéthylamide (LSD) gagnent de la popularité en tant que traitement pour la dépression et l’addiction, la 3,4-méthylènedioxyméthamphétamine (MDMA) pour l’état de stress post-traumatique, et l’ibogaïne pour l’addiction. Malgré des profils pharmacologiques distincts, ces différentes drogues partagent une cinétique d’action similaire : leurs effets thérapeutiques se font ressentir dans les heures suivant l’administration et perdurent au-delà de leur élimination par l’organisme. Ceci suggère des mécanismes plastiques et neurogéniques impliquant entre autres des facteurs trophiques. Cette revue explorera la littérature concernant les effets de ces différents composés sur les neurotrophines, ainsi que les adaptations plastiques qui sont mises en place dans les heures et jours suivant l’administration, afin de comprendre leur potentiel thérapeutique étonnant.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to well documented reports of medical symptoms in Cushing's syndrome (an endocrine disorder with the hallmark of corticoid overproduction), vague and infrequent references to associated mental changes reflect the subjective nature of previous clinical studies of psychological symptoms. This report presents neuropsychological test findings of 35 Cushing's syndrome patients before initiation of medical therapy, and documents the frequency, nature, and severity of deficits. Performances on the Michigan Neuropsychological Test Battery revealed equivocal or no signs of neuropsychological deficits in 13 patients. Ten other patients had few and mild deficits, eight had moderate and more frequent signs of impairment, and four had frequent and marked deficits in language and nonlanguage tests of higher (cognitive) and/or lower (sensory and/or motor) level cerebral functions. The findings thus indicate varying degrees of diffuse bilateral cerebral dysfunction in two thirds of this population. Impairment was more frequent and severe in non verbal visual-ideational and visual memory functions. This pattern of deficits is similar to that in patients with other types of diffuse bilateral neuropathological processes such as toxicity, anoxia, and infectious cerebral disorders.",

Diese können auch ohne den Nachweis einer substanziellen Hirnschädigung in der neuropsychologisch zu erwartenden Region auftreten. Als Ursache für diese Diskrepanz gelten neuroinflammatorische Prozesse und oxidativer Stress. Am häufigsten sind das verbale Gedächtnis, visuell-räumliche Fähigkeiten, das Gedächtnis für visuelle Inhalte, Aufmerksamkeit, Arbeitsgedächtnis, Exekutivfunktionen (Planung, Kontrolle, Problemlösung, Aufmerksamkeit, Entscheidungsfindung), die allgemeine kognitive Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit und die sprachliche Domäne betroffen. Es zeigt sich, dass das Vorhandensein kognitiver Beeinträchtigungen einen wesentlichen Risikofaktor darstellt, nicht mehr beruflich reintegriert werden zu können. Zusätzlich zu den kognitiven Symptomen treten nach einer aSAB auch gehäuft psychiatrische Symptome wie Angst, Depression und Fatigue auf. Diese wirken sich zusätzlich zu den körperlichen und kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen negativ auf die Teilhabe am beruflichen und sozialen Leben aus, was wiederum zu einer schlechteren Lebensqualität beiträgt.",

This article is written to advance the recognition and diagnosis of NCSE. Case presentation Four cases of NCSE were reported and their semiology, electroencephalogram (EEG) features, etiology, treatment and prognosis were retrospectively analyzed. Most of the 4 cases presented with impaired consciousness (confused, slow reaction and lags in response) and some strange behaviors (being upset and restless or washing hands repeatedly). None of them had any obvious motor symptoms like tonic or clonic movements. EEG of the 4 cases initially manifested with either a focal or a generalized onset, then evolved into spike-and-wave pattern gradually. With a favorable response to antiepileptic drugs, they all had a good outcome without any sequela. Conclusions NCSE is much more common than was considered in the past, which is featured by little or no evidence of movement or other symptoms. NCSE can lead to a favorable outcome in most patients.",

Withdrawal from marijuana presents with mild symptoms or irritability, depression, insomnia, nausea, and anorexia. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance.

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "abstract": "Congenital insensitivity to pain or more scientifically Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) is a rare genetic disorder which associates a sensory dysfunction with a varying degree of autonomic dysfunction. Due to the peripheral neuropathy, a decreased sensitivity or even complete anesthesia may be present resulting in, on the ophthalmological level, neurotrophic ulcers. We report the case of 2 sisters (JM and KM) presenting with HSAN with recurrent corneal ulcers. Unfortunately, genetic testing couldn’t be performed due to lack of means, but the clinical presentation and features were very favourable or even pathognomonic of this syndrome. The first cases or reported individuals presenting with congenital insensitivity to pain goes back to 1930’s. Five types of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy have been identified according to age of onset of symptoms, clinical features and affected gene. HSAN type IV also known as congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is the second most common HSAN. It is caused by mutation in the NTRK1(Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1) (TRKA) gene located in chromosome 1 (1q21-q22). It is characterized by repetitive hyperthermic episodes in infancy, and mental retardation is usually present, as reported in our case. Clinical symptoms of pain insensitivity manifest as tongue, lip and fingers biting, and self-inflicted injuries. Congenital insensitivity to pain is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by an absence or an altered response to pain. Individuals with this syndrome can presented self-inflicted injuries and auto-mutilation leading in some cases to severe disabilities. Long-term visual prognosis in CIPA patients is not assessed and there’s an important lack of data regarding ocular manifestation of CIP syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Pain is the most impressive symptom of a disturbed homeostasis in a segment of the body or an organ. It originates (with few exceptions) from stimulation of the so-called tissue nociceptors. Their stimulation results in depolarisation of C-fibers. The stimulus will be transferred to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and may then, depending on facilitating or inhibiting modulation, be conducted through the spinothalamic tract to the medulla oblongata (1,2). Here, in the hypothalamus and the thalamus, additional processing takes place before the information is translated into the sensation of \"pain.\" The subjective feeling of pain may be influenced by further factors such as distraction. In principle, the production of pain can be modulated, either amplified or reduced, at all of the aforementioned levels.",

The main groups of medications relevant to anxiety and insomnia are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine and paroxetine), the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., venlafaxine and duloxetine), the benzodiazepines ( BZDs ) (e.g., diazepam and lorazepam), and others, including buspirone, pregabalin, and herbal remedies. Other hypnotic drugs are antihistamines, some sedative antidepressants, and melatonin antagonists. Each group of medications has shown some efficacy, at least in the short term. Adverse reactions are usually not severe, although the BZDs can cause dependence in the long term and withdrawal reactions with discontinuation of use.",

Treatment options are thus limited to symptomatic presentations and strive to relieve patients and caregivers of some of the behavioral and psychiatric sequelae that can severely impact the quality of life. In fact, neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia affect virtually all patients with dementia at some time during the disease course and are associated with earlier institutionalization, increased caregiving costs (both financial and otherwise), and worsened disease progression. Unfortunately, pharmacological measures acting on neurocircuitry that may be damaged in the brains of patients with dementia as well as attempts to utilize non-pharmacological, cognition-acting strategies in cognitively impaired patients with dementia may not be as effective as they are for younger, non-demented patients. It is also important to note that improvements in behavioral symptoms (e.g., depression) may be due not solely to a prescribed psychotropic agent but may also be a result of the extra social contact with the treatment team that medication warrants.",

We present a case series of two patients who developed cefepime-induced altered mental status and EEG findings of GPDs at a rate of 2-2.5 Hz concerning for the ictal-interictal continuum (IIC). Both cases were treated as possible NCSE with ASMs in addition to the withdrawal of cefepime, resulting in different clinical outcomes.

(2) Ask the collateral source what is causing the most problems in the patient’s life. Often it is mood instability. “He’s not the same person” is a common complaint. Sometimes, the most important problems following concussion are not immediately apparent to the patient. (3) Look for the “top of the cascade”—one single problem that is the root cause of one or more additional problems. For example, sleep disruption can in turn worsen memory, attention, pain, mood disorders and many other symptoms.

      "abstract": "Autoimmune-mediated encephalitis is a disease that often encompasses psychiatric symptoms as its first clinical manifestation's predominant and isolated characteristic. Novel guidelines even distinguish autoimmune psychosis from autoimmune encephalitis. The aim of this review is thus to explore whether a wide range of psychiatric symptoms and syndromes are associated or correlate with autoantibodies.We conducted a PubMed search to identify appropriate articles concerning serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) autoantibodies associated with psychiatric symptoms and syndromes between 2000 and 2020. Relying on this data, we developed a diagnostic approach to optimize the detection of autoantibodies in psychiatric patients, potentially leading to the approval of an immunotherapy.We detected 10 major psychiatric symptoms and syndromes often reported to be associated with serum and/or CSF autoantibodies comprising altered consciousness, disorientation, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive behavior, psychosis, catatonia, mood dysfunction, anxiety, behavioral abnormalities (autism, hyperkinetic), and sleeping dysfunction. The following psychiatric diagnoses were associated with serum and/or CSF autoantibodies: psychosis and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mood disorders, minor and major neurocognitive impairment, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, eating disorders and addiction. By relying on these symptom clusters and diagnoses in terms of onset and their duration, we classified a subacute or subchronic psychiatric syndrome in patients that should be screened for autoantibodies. We propose further diagnostics entailing CSF analysis, electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Exploiting these technologies enables standardized and accurate diagnosis of autoantibody-associated psychiatric symptoms and syndromes to deliver early immunotherapy.We have developed a clinical diagnostic pathway for classifying subgroups of psychiatric patients whose psychiatric symptoms indicate a suspected autoimmune origin.",

Chronic/ recurrent disorders seems to have they causes in the particular personality traits and deficits. Some of them are revealed, described and could be measured by means of Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON 2006. In this approach, functional disorder is understood as structured systems of the particular nonverbal language (“parole”) in which symptoms play a role of words while syndromes the role of sentences, expressing the current state of mind – mainly the need of bond with other people and its frustration. They are messages of looking attention, attachment. The use of such language seems to be the result of personality deficits making difficult or even impossible to fulfil the need of bond in the psychosocial field using common for done culture verbal and nonverbal language, “normal” means of communication. While in the acute and conditioned reactions on stress different forms of helping people (e.g. CBT) seems to be adequate, in the chronic and recurrent functional disorders therapy is postulated to aiming rather at transformations of the communication, leading to the exchange of the messages’ language having the quality of disorder for common, mainly verbal one.",

Such observations support the view that stopping treatment is not equivalent to being untreated. With lithium, antipsychotics and antidepressants, there is consistent evidence that abrupt or rapid discontinuation is followed by earlier clinical worsening than with more gradual removal of treatment. Moreover, treatment discontinuation can complicate interpretation of responses to changes in treatment, including in clinical practice and in experimental treatment trials. Notably, terminating preceding treatments can lead to both discontinuation and carry-over effects that can have an impact on the interpretation of observed outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy can be accompanied by changes in cognition, personality, affect, and other elements of behavior. There is no single epileptic constitution or personality complex. A unifying theme to the behavior in epilepsy is diversity. As one looks at the behavioral traits reported in epilepsy, a specific and consistent pattern is lacking. Rather, extremes of behavior are accentuated: sometimes in one direction, often in both directions. Changes in emotional state are prominent among behavioral features in epilepsy. Some authors describe a prominent deepening or increase in emotionality, whereas others identify a global decrease in emotional life and content. Emotional lability is also reported. Sexuality and libido are typically decreased, but fetishism, transvestism, exhibitionism, and hypersexual episodes also occur. Concerns over morality may be lacking or exaggerated. Patients may be irritable and aggressive or timid and apathetic. The impressive list of people with epilepsy in politics, religion, arts, and sciences suggests a positive expression of this behavioral spectrum. Psychosis, depression, paranoia, and personality disorders may represent a negative pole of epilepsy-related behavioral changes. The most important aspect of behavioral changes in epilepsy for physicians is to recognize and treat dysfunctional behavior. Depression is a common problem that is often unrecognized and untreated. Other treatable problems include impotence, anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis. Identifying risk factors will, it is hoped, assist in developing methods to prevent these disorders.",

The disorder is an antineuronal antibody-mediated neuropsychiatric disorder caused by a poststreptococcal, autoimmune condition affecting control of movement, mood, behaviour and potentially the heart. The treatment remains empirical, and is less than optimal. There are few large clinically controlled trials. Recommendations for optimal management remain inconsistent and are hampered by the side effects from pharmacotherapy. Care for patients should be targeted at primary treatment (penicillin and bed rest), secondary palliation (symptomatic medication) and supportive (social) care. Small studies have demonstrated trends to support the use of immunoglobulins and steroids as therapeutic interventions for children affected by Sydenham’s chorea.",

Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

      "title": "Bulimia nervosa: literature review",
      "abstract": "Daniella Meytin1 1Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Academy of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Abstract Bulimia nervosa is one of the most common eating disorders. The disease manifests in episodes of binge eating, accompanied by attempts to get rid of the food eaten by vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals, along with excessive concerns, regarding weight and appearance. The disease is more common in the Western culture, among women, especially among younger aged (usually beginning in late adolescence). The onset of the disease is influenced by biological and environmental factors. Due to laxative use, hypokalemia and arrhythmias may develop; due to vomiting – enamel damage and voice changes. Bulimia nervosa is diagnosed, if, during the last 3 months, the patient had at least 1 episode of binge eating per week, accompanied by compensatory actions (vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals). Treatment is started with psychotherapy, if it does not help or the patient is additionally diagnosed with depression, SSRI or SNRI treatment is added. 80% of treated patients achieve remission of the disease. Aim: to determine the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. Methods: a systematic review of the literature was performed using the PubMed medical database. Selected articles examining the etiology, epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. English word combinations were used for search: bulimia nervosa, eating disorder, bulimia, bulimia diagnostics, bulimia treatment. Conclusions: after systematic literature review was conducted, the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa were presented. Keywords: bulimia nervosa, eating disorders, bulimia, psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "Aim. We report the case of two young subjects who developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during a heavy use of ecstasy. After several months of discontinuation of the drug, major depression with psychotic features developed in one subject and a psychotic disorder in the other individual. No mental disorder preceded the use of ecstasy in any subject. Findings. A familial and personality vulnerability for mental disorder was revealed in one subject, but not in the other, and all physical, laboratory and cerebral NMR evaluations showed normal results in both patients. Remission of OCD and depressive episode or psychotic disorder was achieved after treatment with a serotoninergic medication associated with an antipsychotic. Conclusions. The heavy long-term use of ecstasy may induce an alteration in the brain balance between serotonin and dopamine, which might constitute a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the onset of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and psychotic symptoms. The heavy use of ecstasy probably interacted with a vulnerability to psychiatric disorder in one subject, whereas we cannot exclude that an “ecstasy disorder” ex novo affected the other individual.",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss can result from disorders or damage to the ear (peripheral auditory system) or the brain (central auditory system). Here, the basic structure and function of the central auditory system will be highlighted as relevant to cases of permanent hearing loss where assistive devices (hearing aids) are called for. The parts of the brain used for hearing are altered in two basic ways in instances of hearing loss: (1) Damage to the ear can reduce the number and nature of input channels that the brainstem receives from the ear, causing plasticity of the central auditory system. This plasticity may partially compensate for the peripheral loss, or add new abnormalities such as distorted speech processing or tinnitus. (2) In some situations, damage to the brain can occur independently of the ear, as may occur in cases of head trauma, tumors or aging. Implications of deficits to the central auditory system for speech perception in noise, hearing aid use and future innovative circuit designs will be provided to set the stage for subsequent presentations in this special educational session.

MHP isclassified as a somatic type of delusional disorder in DSM-IV and is defined as an erroneous conviction of bodily disease, abnormality or alteration. It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

Schizophrenia, depression, developmental disorders, acquired brain disorders (traumatic brain injury and stroke), and neurodegenerative disorders all have cognitive impairment as a manifestation. Cognitive enhancers can improve intellectual function and have been approved for Alzheimer’s dementia, dementia of Parkinson’s disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Cognitive enhancers are being developed for other cognitive disorders. There are many advantages for development of symptomatic cognitive enhancers compared to disease-modifying agents. Cognitive enhancers typically modulate transmitter systems. Cross-disease phenotypes such as executive function impairment may represent a development strategy for cognitive enhancing agents. Life cycle management strategies for cognitive enhancers include expanding indications to disorders with related pathophysiology or to different stages of disease severity and development of alternate formulations. Cognitive enhancers can restore essential cognitive capability and are a critical element of optimal care of patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",

Major depression with psychotic features responds poorly to treatment if an antipsychotic is not used in addition to an antidepressant; however, an antipsychotic confers no additional benefit in nonpsychotic depression. Antipsychotic drugs do have significant short- and long-term side effects, including pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. The possibility of a good therapeutic response with minimal side effects can be increased if psychotic depression is diagnosed accurately and the antipsychotic is prescribed according to established clinical guidelines.",

Pharmacodynamic aggravation of epilepsy usually translates into both increased seizure frequency and increased interictal electroencephalographic changes. A doubling or greater in seizure frequency may be considered as evidence for seizure aggravation. Seizure aggravation can occur with virtually all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (Somerville, 2002; Gayatri and Livingston, 2006).

      "abstract": "Being most common mental health disorder, Major depressive disorder, have affected approximately 350 million people all throughout the world at any time. In ranking among the cause of disability it has been ranked as major leading cause for disability in worldwide. (1) Major depressive disorder is debilitating disease and has and at least one individual depressive episode for minimum of two weeks and involves changed mood, decreased interest in surrounding and decreased pleasure specifically in activities which were earlier pleasurable along with changes in cognitive function and changes in vegetative symptoms (2) . few of these patient might report guilt feelings and feelings of worthlessness or feeling of hopelessness, also patient reports of repetitive negative thoughts about individual self and their future (3) . Taking consideration prevalence and the suffering, morbidity, dysfunction, and economic burden depression is major public health concern disorder. Depression being more common in women than men, report on global burden of disease suggests the point prevalence of unipolar depressive episodes is 1.9% for men and 3.2% for women, while the estimated one year prevalence to be 5.8% for men and 9.5% for women. Study says that if current trends for demographic and epidemiologic transitions continue by the year 2020, the burden of disease might increase up to 5.7% of total burden of the disease making it second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), second to ischemic heart disease. (4) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the first-line therapy for treating MDD because of their superior tolerability and safety profiles relative to monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. (6) Therapeutic application of these inhibitors is based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. Unfortunately, over half of MDD patients do not achieve remission after a 12-week treatment with SSRIs. Studies have also shown that one-third of patients treated with successive antidepressant therapies do not achieve remission even after a 1-year intervention. (7) Thus in this study we attempt to examine the better treatment amongst two groups that can help to treat our patients and improve clinical outcome.",

Hinzu kommen die Sedierung, mögliche Sedierungslücken und ganz allgemein die medizinische Behandlung. Teilweise kann dies von den Patienten nur schlecht verarbeitet werden. Einzelne oder mehrere dieser Faktoren können bei vorbestehender Disposition oder unzureichendem Coping zu einer Vielzahl psychiatrischer Erkrankungen führen. Herausgegriffen werden im folgenden Artikel Schlafstörungen, Anpassungsstörungen, Depressionen sowie das Spektrum der Angsterkrankungen (v.a. Generalisierte Angststörung und Panikattacken), zu denen im amerikanischen Diagnosemanual DSM-IV-R auch die akute Belastungsstörung und die posttraumatische Belastungsstörung zählen. Die genannten Erkrankungen können nicht nur auf der Intensivstation sondern auch nach der Verlegung auf die Normalstation auftreten. In unseren eigenen Untersuchungen wurde der Wechsel von der \"Rundumversorgung\" zur \"Normalversorgung\" von den Patienten häufig als belastend erlebt. Oftmals erscheinen die Symptome zu Beginn unspezifisch und nur schwer kategorisierbar, daher werden zunächst einige psychopathologische Leitsymptome beschrieben und die entsprechenden Differentialdiagnosen dargestellt. Neben dem genauen Erheben des psychopathologischen Befundes sind auch eine umfassende (psychiatrische) Anamnese und die Beobachtung des Verlaufs wichtig um eine genaue Diagnose zu stellen. Da neben dem individuellen Leid sowohl der weitere Verlauf der somatischen Erkrankung als auch die Rehabilitation beeinträchtigt wird und die Störungen bei fehlender Therapie zur Chronifizierung neigen, ist eine frühzeitige Diagnose durch die Kooperation von Intensivmedizinern und Psychiatern von essentieller Bedeutung.

Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse. However, further studies should be carried out to clarify clinical characteristics of the nicotine paradox.",

Gejala negatif yaitu tidak ada atau kehilangan dorongan atau kehendak serta menarik diri. Sedangkan gejala positif yaitu halusinasi, waham, perilaku yang aneh dan pikiran yang tidak terorganisir (Videbeck, 2009). \r\nHalusinasi merupakan bentuk gangguan persepsi dimana individu mengalami kehilangan kemampuan dalam membedakan rangsangan internal (pikiran) dan rangsangan eksternal (dunia luar).

Signifikante Unterschiede wurden im Theta bzw. Alpha Band \r\nfestgestellt. Diese Ergebnisse unterstutzen die Verwertung von auf ERD/ERS \r\nbasierten kognitiven Parametern bei Epilepsie. Anhand einer methodischen \r\nUntersuchung von dynamischen Eigenschaften wurde ein onlinefahiger ERD/ERS \r\nAlgorithmus fur zukunftige Neurofeedback Applikationen ausgewahlt. Basierend auf \r\ndem ausgewahlten Parameter wurde eine Methodik fur die online Gewinnung und \r\nQuantifizierung von kognitionsbezogener induzierter Hirnaktivitat entwickelt. \r\nDie dazugehorigen Prozeduren sind in Module organisiert, um die \r\nProzessapplikabilitat zu erhohen. Mehrere Bestandteile der Methodik, \r\neinschlieslich der Rolle von Elektrodenmontagen sowie die Eliminierung bzw. \r\nReduktion der evozierten Aktivitat, wurden anhand kognitiver Aufgaben evaluiert \r\nund optimiert. Die Entwicklung einer geeigneten Neurofeedback Strategie sowie \r\ndie Bestatigung der psychophysiologischen Hypothese anhand einer Pilotstudie \r\nsollen Gegenstand der zukunftigen Arbeitschritte sein.",

      "title": "Trihexyphenidyl Use Disorder and Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic drug commonly used in treating movement disorders.[1] The widespread use of trihexyphenidyl has led to the exploration of its abuse potential due to its anxiolytic, euphoriant, hallucinogenic, and sexual stimulant effects.[2] It is a popular drug of abuse among the thrill-seeking adolescent male population, used either orally or smoked in a powdered form mixed with tobacco.[3] The prevalence of trihexyphenidyl abuse has been reported to vary from 6.5% to 34% among schizophrenia patients, with doses of trihexyphenidyl abuse varying from 28 mg/day to as high as 200 mg/day.[4] The risk factors for trihexyphenidyl abuse are male gender, unemployment, concomitant use of other illicit substances, family history of substance dependence, long-term use of trihexyphenidyl, and severe mental disorders.[4] The most common aim of abuse is anxiolysis, sedation, or a mood-enhancing euphoric effect to alleviate depressive and negative symptoms.[4] Even though trihexyphenidyl dependence has been previously described, the literature is scanty as it may mimic a primary psychiatric illness leading to misdiagnosis further compounded by a lack of awareness about the drug's abuse potential. We describe a case where prescribed trihexyphenidyl use gradually progressed to a use disorder, leading to social, financial, occupational, and biological dysfunctions. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old male with a history of possible dissociative episodes of unresponsiveness associated with anxiety, currently in remission and off all medications, presented to the psychiatry outpatient department with the inability to stop consuming trihexyphenidyl tablets. For the past 4 years, the patient has had bilateral fine hand tremors, for which tablet trihexyphenidyl was initiated for possible essential tremors, titrated to 4–5 mg per day. After 2 years of regular use, he noticed that his tremor completely resolved after the trihexyphenidyl dose and would aggravate after 4–5 h of the last dose of trihexyphenidyl, along with slurring of speech. Over the next year, the use frequency increased to more than 6–8 mg per day as the duration of relief from tremors decreased with each dose. He started experiencing other difficulties whenever the effect of trihexyphenidyl wore out, such as a generalized feeling of the slowness of movements, stiffness in body parts, difficulty walking, and difficulty in writing. Patient's writing samples, with and without consumption of trihexyphenidyl are attached in Figure 1. Simultaneously, he also noticed that trihexyphenidyl ingestion made him feel energetic, increased his self-confidence, and made him happier. He would get a high with its consumption and described it as if \"everything was possible\" for him. He took trihexyphenidyl first thing in the morning to get out of bed and start his day. He would also spend more money under the effect of trihexyphenidyl than his usual self, would at times be involved in activities that caused him financial harm, such as lending money to people recklessly and also experienced substantially increased libido. Over the next few months, he noticed that after the effects of THP waned off, he would start to experience low mood, reduced interest in carrying out activities, would feel that life is vain, had to struggle with all the movements and started to have suicidal ideations. Later, he started using trihexyphenidyl without prescription at about 10–12 mg per day in divided doses, sourcing it from his workplace pharmacy. He experienced side effects of the medication, like dry mouth, but chose to ignore it to alleviate the depressive symptoms. A representation of illness graph of the patient is given in Figure 2.Figure 1: Handwriting samples of the patient before and after taking a dose of trihexyphenidyl. The image is not reused from any source or copyrightFigure 2: Illness graph of the patient. THP: Trihexyphenidyl, TDS: thrice dailyOn examination, he had fine bilateral hand tremors, the speech was slurred, facial expressions were reduced, gait with a forward stooped posture and bradykinesia. On mental status examination, depressed affect and decreased self-esteem were present. He had taken trihexyphenidyl 4 h before this examination. Various differential diagnoses were considered and ruled out systematically. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was ruled out due to nonspecific motor symptoms and symptom onset only after trihexyphenidyl withdrawal. Drug-induced Parkinson's was ruled out as the current symptoms from the past 4 years have been without the use of any neuroleptics. Vascular Parkinsonism was ruled out due to prominent upper limb involvement and a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Wilson's disease evaluation was negative. With a provisional diagnosis of trihexyphenidyl use disorder based on tolerance, craving, and use despite harm and withdrawals, he was started on tablet escitalopram 5 mg and up-titrated to 10 mg to counter the depressive and anxiety symptoms during withdrawal; tablet propranolol 20 mg was started to manage the tremors, and trihexyphenidyl tapered slowly over 6 months. At the follow-up, he had decreased trihexyphenidyl dose gradually to 2 mg per day without any withdrawal. He maintained well without any tremors. Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication as a case report. DISCUSSION DSM 5 recognizes the antiparkinsonian drugs (including trihexyphenidyl) abuse under the \"other (or unknown) substance use disorder\" category. ICD 10 did not clarify any such category, and ICD 11 describes \"disorder due to use of other specified psychoactive substances including medications.\" However, it does not describe the classes of medications. Hence, whether nonprescription misuse of trihexyphenidyl should be regarded as psychoactive substance use is still questionable. The euphorigenic effects of trihexyphenidyl can be explained by the inhibition of dopamine reuptake and storage consequent to the strong muscarinic receptor blockade[4] as well as its increased affinity for dopamine receptors in the limbic area at higher dosages. Thus, it stimulates the central nervous reward system leading to a \"high.\"[5] Similar stimulant effects have been described with other anticholinergics, such as biperiden and procyclidine.[6] However, tolerance to these effects also develops fast, compelling the patient to increase the doses, which may lead to exaggerating its adverse effects and psychosis-like behavior alterations.[4] This anticholinergic abuse has also been associated with withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs in Parkinson's disease often markedly exacerbates Parkinsonian symptoms, movement disorders,[7] depressive or dysphoric mood symptoms, and even results in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[8] This could be due to acetylcholine receptor hypersensitivity in response to long-term anticholinergic use. The sudden anticholinergic withdrawal might worsen the severity of the symptoms than the initial presentation.[9] A similar phenomenon was observed in our patient, who developed motor symptoms following the discontinuation of trihexyphenidyl. Ruberg et al.[10] in 1982 reported increased acetylcholine receptor densities in the frontal lobes of patients on anticholinergics; similar changes are expected to be seen in nigrostriatal cholinergic receptors.[9] The hypersensitive cholinergic receptor state is similar to the cholinergic excess stage in Parkinsonism, leading to various movement dysfunctions. However, it is essential to mention that going by this mechanism of action, all anticholinergics would have an abuse potential, which is not evident. Therefore, the exact pathophysiological mechanism is yet to be elicited. An image representing possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal is given in Figure 3.Figure 3: Possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal effects. Ach: Acetylcholine, DA: Dopamine, \"rec\": ReceptorsIn this case, evidence suggesting trihexyphenidyl withdrawal-induced movement and mood disorders is the presence of a temporal relationship between trihexyphenidyl dosing and symptom onset which appears to be very similar to the \"on-off\" phenomenon seen with levodopa use in patients of Parkinson's disease. Among various management options, one study suggests tapering 1 mg of trihexyphenidyl every 2 weeks. Another deprescribing guideline by the University of Sydney and Macquarie University recommends a relatively slow tapering, reducing 25% of the daily dose in 1–4 weeks, depending on the nature and severity of withdrawal symptoms, and ending the treatment 2 weeks after giving the lowest dose. Nonpharmacological support such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, exercise, and social support should be given. If tapering is ineffective, consider switching to another anticholinergic agent, with minimal side effects. Tapering off trihexyphenidyl within 3 months of starting has been recommended.[5] Therefore, in light of such reported cases, it is essential to realize that easy affordability, availability, and prolonged prescription would lead to easy escalation of trihexyphenidyl doses leading to potential misuse among patients and this needs to be dealt with caution.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN La aparición de síntomas psicóticos es una de las complicaciones más frecuentes producidas por el consumo agudo o crónico de cocaína, apareciendo hasta en el 65-70% de los consumidores. El síndrome de Ekbom se ha relacionado con múltiples causas, entre ellas el consumo de estimulantes y con la abstinencia al alcohol. El paciente tiene la convicción delirante monotemática de estar infectado por parásitos, lo cual puede acompañarse de otras manifestaciones como alteraciones sensoperceptivas. OBJETIVOS Analizar el papel de la cocaína en la aparición del síndrome de Ekbom. MATERIAL Y MÉTODO Descripción de un caso clínico y su revisión bibliográfica. Varón de 56 años, sin antecedentes en Salud Mental. Ex consumidor de cannabis y cocaína. Como antecedentes somáticos presenta infección por VHC curada y VIH. Recae en el consumo de cocaína tras fallecimiento de un familiar en Enero 2022, siendo derivado a la Unidad de Hospitalización en Junio 2022 por convicción delirante paranoide y actividad alucinatoria. En la exploración psicopatológica el paciente presenta delirios de infestación y zoopsias. En la exploración física observamos escoriaciones y cicatrices que se corresponden con rascado. Sin embargo, en el examen clínico no se encuentran alteraciones que justifiquen estas lesiones. Al ingreso comienza con Olanzapina 10mg desapareciendo la sintomatología en un par de días. CONCLUSIONES Es necesario hacer un correcto diagnóstico diferencial, mediante un examen clínico exhaustivo, el cual, en este caso, no pone de manifiesto ninguna patología física que justifique el cuadro, a pesar de lo cual el paciente presenta absoluta convicción. La idea delirante se ha relacionado con el aumento de los niveles de dopamina en los ganglios basales por el bloqueo del transportador de dopamina que producen los psicoestimulantes como la cocaína. De esta forma, es imprescindible el cese del consumo de tóxicos y un correcto tratamiento con neurolépticos.",

      "abstract": "A lot of drugs have been reported to have adverse effects on sexual functions. Interference with ejaculation in man, failure to reach orgasm in women, decreased libido can occur with any centrally acting drugs or drugs that act on the sympathetic nervous system. In fact, the incidence of adverse sexual effects of drugs is not well documented. The effects which lead to sexual dysfunction are mostly reported by patients which are themselves reluctant to discuss with their physician. Antihistaminics, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, antidepressants, antipsychotics and minor tranquilizer may have an adverse effect on sexual function. Because elderly people are prone to adverse drug effects, they arc expected to experience more side effects on their sexual life with commonly prescribed drugs than younger ones are to. Refraining drug use and attentive listening may help the patient restore his normal sexual life.",

      "title": "Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and dissociative experiences: Suggested underlying mechanisms and implications for science and practice",
      "abstract": "A strong and specific link between obsessive-compulsive disorder or symptoms (OCD/S) and a tendency for dissociative experiences (e.g., depersonalization-derealization, absorption and imaginative involvement) cannot be explained by trauma and is poorly understood. The present theoretical formulation proposes five different models conceptualizing the relationship. According to Model 1, dissociative experiences result from OCD/S through inward-focused attention and repetition. According to Model 2, dissociative absorption causally brings about both OCD/S and associated cognitive risk factors, such as thought-action fusion, partly through impoverished sense of agency. The remaining models highlight common underlying causal mechanisms: temporo-parietal abnormalities impairing embodiment and sensory integration (Model 3); sleep alterations causing sleepiness and dreamlike thought or mixed sleep-wake states (Model 4); and a hyperactive, intrusive imagery system with a tendency for pictorial thinking (Model 5). The latter model relates to Maladaptive Daydreaming, a suggested dissociative syndrome with strong ties to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. These five models point to potential directions for future research, as these theoretical accounts may aid the two fields in interacting with each other, to the benefit of both. Finally, several dissociation-informed paths for further developing clinical intervention in OCD are identified.",

It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Modified state of consciousness (MSC) is defined as a mental state that can be subjectively recognized by an individual or by an objective observer of the individual, as representing a difference in the psychological functioning of the “normal” state, alert and awake of the individual. Drugs are products with definitions and conceptual boundaries, historically defined. The use of psychoactive drugs is related to the increased plasticity of human subjectivity which is reflected in various technical means to change the perception, cognition, affect and mood. The authors propose to conduct a literature review on the types of MSC, the way to achieve them and their implications in drug consumption pattern. A MSC consists of dimensions such as self-oceanic limitlessness, agonizing self-dissolution and visionary restructuring. Normal MSC includes dreams, hypnagogic state and sleep. Others may be induced by hypnosis, meditation or psychoactive substances. Those achieved by drugs allow the subject to access feelings and sensations which go beyond the everyday reality or, on the other hand, leakage of reality. Anthropological studies show that in almost all civilizations, man sought ways to induce MSC. What characterizes the problematic or abusive use of certain substances is not necessarily the amount and frequency of drug use, but the disharmony in the socio-cultural, family and psychosocial contexts of the individual.

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The blocking effect of sensory arousal and of active attention on epileptic seizures is studied in 200 cases of petit‐mal and 20 cases of grand mal with focal onset. The mechanisms of the seizure block may be similar to desynchronization and reciprocal inhibition of neuronal activity in the cortex during arousal. They may arise from the non‐specific thalamo‐reticular system which is activated by sensory afferents or attention. RÉSUMÉ L'effet du blocage d'une excitation sensorielle et de l'attention active dans des crises épileptiques a été observé en 200 cas de petit mal et 20 cas de grand mal ayant eu un début focal. Les mécanismes du blocage pendant la crise peuvent être semblables à une désynchronisation et à une inhibition réciproque de l'activité neuronale dans le cortex durant l'excitation. lis peuvent provenir du système thalamo‐réticulaire non spécifique qui est activé par des afférents sensoriels ou par l'attention.",

      "abstract": "Several environmental factors play a role in the poor quality of sleep of hospitalized patients, such as noise pollution, nocturnal awakenings for the administration of medication or the taking of vital signs, the discomfort of the beds, the luminosity or even certain night-time equipment. To cope with these insomnia problems in the hospital setting, patients often request drug treatment, which leads to over-prescription of sedatives, such as benzodiazepines. This leads to serious side effects such as an increased risk of falling, confusion and respiratory depression. This hostile hospital environment must be taken into account before considering specific treatment.Plusieurs facteurs environnementaux jouent un rôle dans la mauvaise qualité du sommeil des patients hospitalisés, tels que les nuisances sonores, les réveils nocturnes pour l’administration de médicaments ou la prise de signes vitaux, l’inconfort des lits, la luminosité ou encore certains équipements nocturnes. Pour faire face à ces problèmes d’insomnie en milieu hospitalier, les patients sont souvent demandeurs d’un traitement médicamenteux, ce qui mène à une surprescription de sédatifs, tels que les benzodiazépines. Il s’ensuit des effets secondaires potentiellement dangereux comme un risque accru de chute, un état confusionnel ou encore une dépression respiratoire. L’environnement hospitalier hostile doit davantage être pris en compte avant d’envisager un traitement spécifique.",

      "abstract": "\"Unmada\" is a broad psychopathological entity of Ayurveda that includes various psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions. Pitru grahonmada (PG) is one among 18 types of bhutonmada or grahonmada, and it is caused by affliction of \"pitru graha\" (an evil spirit or super natural power or extraterrestrial force or an idiopathic factor). Previous studies have established the similarity between grahonmadas and different psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions. No studies have been conducted on PG till date. The aim and objective of the present study is to explore PG with the help of contemporary psychiatric literature. Ayurvedic literature related to PG has been collected from major classical Ayurvedic texts and from their commentaries. PG is characterized by features such as \"Aprasanna drishtim and Apashyantam\" (vision loss or abnormalities), \"Chala netra pakshmaanaam\" (abnormal eye movements), \"Shankitekshanam\" (suspicious looks), \"Apasavya vastram\" (confusion or memory loss or disorientation), \"Deena vadanam\" (depression), \"Anannabhilasha or Arochaka or Avipaaka or Alpaagni or Manda paavaka\" (various gastrointestinal tract abnormalities), \"Pratihata vaacham or Skhalat vaacham\" (speech abnormalities), \"Nidraalu\" (excessive sleepiness), \"Samsushka taalukam\" (oral manifestations of Vitamin B12 deficiency), \"Shaantaatma\" (catatonia or depression or reduced psycho-motor activity) and \"Tila, guda, maamsa, and paayasa priyam\" (cravings for sugar and meat). These features of PG have shown striking similarity with Vitamin B12 deficiency-induced neuropsychiatric conditions. PG has shown similarity with various neuropsychiatric manifestations induced by Vitamin B12 deficiency which needs to be established by further studies.",

      "abstract": "• In a study of vestibular responses to caloric stimulation that controlled opportunity for fixation and state of alertness, we evaluated previous findings of diminished nystagmus in schizophrenia. We failed to replicate earlier reports in these respects: (1) None of the psychotic patient groups, when compared with normal controls, showed lower response intensity, latency, or culmination time of the nystagmic response. (2) The schizophrenic groups did not manifest a prevalence of clinically significant asymmetry. We did, however, observe that chronic deteriorated schizophrenics and recent schizophrenics have significantly greater dysrhythmic responses. This diminished orderliness of nystagmus may explain previous reports of absent or diminished nystagmus in the schizophrenics. The results are not compatible with peripheral vestibular disease in schizophrenia, but they may reflect state-related phenomena consistent with disturbances in alertness, which are not necessarily voluntary or motivational in origin.",

      "abstract": "Common causes of memory loss in older people are mild cognitive impairment, the various types of dementia, and psychiatric illness, mainly depression. Around 10% of patients with mild cognitive impairment progress to dementia each year. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of cases. Other common types of dementia are vascular, fronto-temporal, Lewy body, Parkinson's, and mixed type dementia. There is evidence to suggest that dementia pathology is established before the onset of symptoms, and thus mild cognitive impairment can be considered as a predementia stage. NICE guidance suggests examination of: attention, concentration, short- and long-term memory, praxis, language and executive function. Particular attention should be paid to any signs of neglect, state of dress, agitation or poor attention. Dysphasia and difficulty in naming objects is often present. Mood symptoms (including suicidal ideation) may be primary or comorbid. Abnormal thoughts and perceptions should be probed for, as psychotic symptoms are common. Primary care options for cognitive testing include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition or the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. Physical examination should include observation of gait, inspection for tremor; examination for rigidity, bradykinesia, frontal release signs, upper motor neurone lesions, pulse and BP. Structural brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy, exclude other pathologies and act as a prognostic marker of dementia progression but the overlap in structural changes between the dementias makes imaging alone insufficient for diagnostic purposes. NICE guidelines recommend referral to a memory clinic for patients with mild cognitive impairment, those at high risk of dementia, such as patients with learning disabilities, Parkinson's disease, or patients who have had several strokes.",

      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

      "title": "ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS USE IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS",
      "abstract": "Background. Classical antipsychotics – neuroleptics are one of the most frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs in child psychiatry. Atypical antipsychotics are used for the same indications – psychotic (schizophrenia) as well as unpsychotic disorders (pervasive developmental disorders, mood disorders, conduct disorders and tics disorders). It is surprising that the studies on their use with regard to this age group are rather rare. They are carried out on a small number of samples and only exceptionally double blind. This article summarizes published clinical experience with atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents. A short overview of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and side effects is given. Schizophrenia and pervasive developmental disorders are major indications for use of atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents, but they have also been successfully used for other disorders such as aggressive behaviour, tics and anorexia nervosa. Conclusions. With better side-effect profile, some of the atypical antipsychotics are expected to be doctrinally recognised as the first-line treatment for childhood schizophrenia and pervasive developmental disorders. However, more long-term studies carried out on a larger sample are needed. Atypical antipsychotics are already used in everyday practice as first-line treatment of childhood and adolescents schizophrenia.",

Ten patterns were distinguished, which were typical of the type of impairment: (1) crawling–mildly impaired children who will achieve independent walking; (2) creeping and crawling–diplegic children with moderate motor impairment; (3) creeping, never leading to independent walking–children with severe diplegia or tetraplegia; (4) bottom shuffling–children with hemiplegia and ataxia and minimal or mild motor impairment; (5) bunny‐hopping–dyskinetic children with marked motor impairment but generally not mentally retarded; (6) rolling–severely diplegic and dyskinetic children; (7) other forms of locomotion, such as bridging or grub‐type creeping, rare and typical of children with ataxic elements; (8) just walk–children with hemiplegia, diplegia, ataxic diplegia or ataxia, generally in cases of mild motor impairment but mental retardation; (9) just walk with aids–children with severe diplegia; and (10) no mobility. The locomotion pattern, age at onset and even manner of execution all influenced prognosis for walking. Severe deformity affected the choice of locomotion pattern. Though physiotherapy probably would not greatly influence the adoption of a particular locomotion pattern, early intervention might help prevent deformities. RÉSUMÉ Allures du déplacement dans L'IMC Les allures du déplacement ont étéétudiées chez 160 enfants IMC. Dix allures ont été distinguées, qu'on pouvait relier à un type d'incapacité: (1) le ramper–chez les enfants modérément atteints qui marcheront ultérieurement; (2) le glissement et ramper–chez les enfants diplégiques avec troubles moteurs modérés; (3) le glisscment isolé, n'aboutissant jamais à une marche indépendante chez les enfants avec diplégies ou tétraplégies sévères; (4) le déplacement sur le derrière chez les enfant; avec hémiplégie ou ataxic et trouble moteur modére ou léger; (5) le sautillement de lapin chez les enfants dyskinétiques avec trouble moteur sévère mais habituellement non retardés mentaux; (6) le rouler‐ ‐ ‐chez les enfants avec diplégie ou dyskinésie sévères; (7) d'autres formes de déplacement tels que déplacement en pont ou glissemcnt en surface, rares et caractéristiques d'élément ataxiques; (8) la marche limite–chez les enfants avec hémiplégie, diplégie. diplégie ataxique ou ataxie, généralement de trouble moteur léger et retard mental; (9) la marche limite avec aides–chez les enfants avec diplégie grave; (10) absence de toite forme de déplacement. L'allure de déplacement, l'âge au début et même la façon de réiliser marquaicnt le pronostic de marche. Les déformations graves influaient le choix du mode dr déplacement. Une intervention précoce peut aider à prévenir les déformations, même s'il est probable que la kinésithérapie n'influence guère l'adoption d'un mode de déplacement. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Bewegungsmuster bei Cerekralparesen Zusammenfassun Bei 160 Kindem md Cerebralparese wurden die Bewegungsmuster uniersucht. Es wurd 10 Bewegungsmuster unterschieden, die für die jeweilige Art der Schädigung typisch waren; (1) krabbeln–Kinder mit leichter Schädigung. die frei laufen lernen werden; (2) kriechen und krabbeln–diplegische Kinder mil mäßiger motorischer Beeinträchtigung; (3) kriechen, freies Laufen wird nicht erreicht–Kinder mit schwerer Diplegie oder Tetraplegia, (4) schlurfender Gang–Kinder mit Hemiplegie und Ataxie und minimalen oder leichtcn motorischen Störungen; (5) hüpfendyskinetische Kinder mit ausgeprägten motorischen Behinderungen, aber im allgemetnen geistig nicht retardiert; (6) rollen–Kinder mit schwerer Diplegie und Dyskinesia. (7) andere Bewegungsformen, wie bridging oder grubtype creeping, selten und für Kinder mit ataktischen Elementen typisch; (8) nur gehen–Kinder mit Hemiplegie, Diplegie, ataktischer Diplegie oder Ataxie, im allgemeinen bei Fällen mit leichter motorischer Behinderung aber geistiger Retardierung; (9) gehen nur mit Gehhilfern–Kinder mit schwerer Diplegie; (10) keine Mobilität. Bewegungsmuster, Alter bei Beginn und Ausführungsart beeinflußten die Prognose des Laufens. Schwere Deformierungen begrenzten die Wahl des Bewegungsmusters. Obwohl die Physiotherapie wahrscheinlich keinen großen Einfluß auf die Annahme eines bestimmten Bewegungsmusters haben wird, konnten aber durch frühzeitigen Beginn Deformierungen verhindert werden. RESUMEN Patrones de locomoción en los sindromes de parálisis cerebral Se estudiaron los patrones de locomoción en 160 niños con pardlisis cerebral. Se distinguieron diez patrones diferentes tipicos de la forma de alteración: (1) a cuatro patas en los casos con poca alieración y que llegarian a andar; (2) a cuatro patas y arrastrarse sobre el vientre–niños diplégicos con alteración motora modcrada; (3) arrastrarse sobre el vientre, sin llegar nunca a una marcha independiente–niños con una diplegia grave o una tetraplegia; (4) desplazarse sobre el trasero– niños con hemplegia y ataxia y alteración motora minima o moderada; (5) saltando como un conejo–niños discineticos con grave alteración motora pero en general sin retraso menta; (6) enrrollándose–niños con diplegia y discinesia grave; (7) otras formas de locomoción tales como haciendo puente o arrastrarse como una larva, rara y típica de niños con elementos atáxicos; (8) simplemente andar–niños con hempilegia, diplegia atáxica o ataxia, generalmente en casos de alteración motora moderada pero con retraso menta; (9) andar con ayuda–niños con diplegia grave; (10) no movilidad. El tipo de locomoción, la edad al iniciarse e incluso la manera de hacerse todo afeta al pronóstico de la marcha. Una deformidad grave afecta la elección del tipo de locomoción. Si bien de un tipo paticular de patrón, su aplicación precoz puede facilitar la evitación de deformidades.",

      "abstract": "The network therapy approach can be useful in addressing a broad range of patients with addictions characterized by the following clinical hallmarks of substance use disorder: First, when they initiate consumption of their addictive agent, be it alcohol, cocaine, opioids, or depressant drugs, they frequently cannot limit that consumption to a reasonable and predictable level; this phenomenon has been termed \"loss of control\" by clinicians who treat persons dependent on alcohol or drugs. Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis). These patients may need special supportive care (e.g., inpatient detoxification or long-term residential treatment).",

Although it can be achieved by non-pharmacological measurements (sleeping, computer training, exercising), people often tend to reach for pharmacological solutions like OTC substances (coffee, energy drinks and Ginkgo biloba extract pills), and most recently, psychostimulant drugs (amphetamines, methylphenidat, modafinil) perscribed by doctors for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy, which are obtained illegaly from a „black market“. This kind of practice is usually associated with certain social groups like pupils and students with prevalence rates between 1 and 20%, depending on the design of study. Efficiency of pharmacological cognitive enhancement (PCE) also differs among individuals and appears to be the highest in those whose initial neurotransmiter (dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin) concentrations are low. On the other hand, media, as well as public, sees „smart drugs“ as highly efficient and considers PCE to be cheating. Using drugs to inhance cognitive performance is a controversial subject that opens up many scientific and moral questions, which, for now, stay unaswered: should the use of „smart drugs“ be legalized and would legalization lead to social progress, what kind of health consequences (especially on young people) would PCE have, having in mind differences in efficiancy among individuals, how would it be determined in which individuals would the benefit of PCE be bigger than risks, which steps should be taken to educate the public etc. Further research about efficiancy and safety of use of drugs as cognitive enhancers is needed.",

From the day of deprivation – in the self-rating from the 4th day – up to 1 week later a therapeutic effect can be observed. The psychic part of the symptomatology was more reduced than the somatic one. Compared to total and partial SD during the 2nd half of the night, there is, on average, a smaller therapeutic effect which occurs later. The diurnal variation of the depressive symptomatology is less influenced. According to the period without sleep, the circadian course of the heart rate is less and differently modified by SD during the 1st half of the night. Only an existing diurnal variation (before SD) is a predictor of the prompt effect. Implications for the mechanism of the therapeutic SD were discussed. For clinical practice, SD during the 2nd half of the night is the method of choice.",

Noncognitive feature is a terminology that draws the distinction between cognitive loss and the heterogeneous group of symptoms that include psychiatric symptoms such as depression, hallucinations, delusions and misidentifications. This term also includes behavioral disturbances such as aggression, agitation, pacing and eating disorders (Burns et al., 1990). An alternative expression is neuropsychiatric features (Cummings et al., 1994). The term \"Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia\" (BPSD) has also been defined as \"symptoms of disturbed perception, thought content, mood and behavior that frequently occur in patients with dementia\" (Consensus Conference on the Behavioral Disturbances of Dementia, 1996). Noncognitive disorders can cause distress both to patients and carers. Such changes are often a determinant for institutional care. A study reported that psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) were present in about 50% of patients with dementia and disruptive behavior (e.g., physical violence, hiding things, wandering, demanding or critical behavior) in up to 70% (Rabins et al., 1982). These include hitting, yelling, grabbing people, wandering, hoarding, and repetitive gestures and questioning (Moak & Fisher, 1990; Reisberg et al., 1987). All of these problematic behaviors are often grouped together as \"agitation\" or \"agitated behavior\".",

      "abstract": "El alprazolam es un benzodiacepinico de accion intermedia. Su vida media es de 6 a 12 horas. Pocos estudios existen sobre la intoxicacion con esta benzodiacepina. La intoxicacion oral por benzodiacepinas (BZD) que se toman en sobredosis sin coadyuvante rara vez causa toxicidad significativa. La presentacion clinica clasica de dicha intoxicacion incluye depresion del SNC con signos vitales normales. Clinicamente existe disartria, ataxia y alteracion del estado mental. El compromiso respiratorio es poco comun con las ingestiones orales aisladas, pero se puede observar cuando los pacientes ingieren agentes hipnoticos, sedantes adicionales (como etanol) o cuando los medicos administran BZD como uno de varios agentes para la sedacion de procedimiento. Resumen del caso: paciente masculino de 17 anos de edad que ingiere oralmente doce tabletas de alprazolam como intento de autolisis. Acude por el servicio de emergencia con somnolencia, enlentecimiento del lenguaje, incoherencia y mareo. Signos vitales estables. Los examenes complementarios no revelan anormalidad. Se realizan interconsultas a Psicologia y Psiquiatria confirmando diagnostico de depresion mayor, en 72 horas evoluciona favorablemente. Conclusiones: La intoxicacion por benzodiacepinas orales de forma aislada rara vez causa depresion respiratoria, descartandose el mito al pensar que una intoxicacion oral por benzodiacepinas es igual a depresion respiratoria.",

      "title": "Clinical approach to the weak patient in the intensive care unit.",
      "abstract": "Motor weakness in a patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) may be related to (1) pre-existing neuromuscular disorder that leads to ICU admission, (2) new-onset or previously undiagnosed neurological disorder, or (3) complications of non-neuromuscular critical illness. Neuromuscular syndromes related to ICU treatment consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and are now recognized as a frequent cause of newly acquired weakness in ICU patients. Clinical features include quadriparesis, muscle wasting, and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Evaluation of these patients is based on knowledge of clinical setting and predisposing factors, focused neurological examination, detailed electrophysiological investigation, serum creatine kinase level, other laboratory studies as needed, and histological examination of muscle biopsy. If a central nervous system (brain or spinal cord) lesion is suspected, neuroimaging studies are required. In addition to conventional nerve conduction and needle electromyography, phrenic nerve conduction, diaphragm electromyography, blink reflex, and (recently) the technique of direct muscle stimulation have been employed. Critical illness polyneuropathy is an axonal motor and sensory neuropathy that often follows sepsis and multiorgan failure. Risk factors for critical illness myopathy are corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking drugs, acute respiratory illness, and organ transplant. Three subtypes (acute necrotizing myopathy, thick myosin filament loss myopathy, and type II fiber atrophy) are recognized. Major differential diagnoses of critical illness related paralysis are incidental Guillain-Barré syndrome and unmasked myasthenia gravis. Rarely, atypical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polymyositis or other myopathies, and precipitation of porphyria or rhabdomyolysis due to drugs used in the ICU have been described. Recently a poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis due to West Nile virus infection was reported. A subgroup of patients with myasthenia gravis with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody is noted to present as respiratory crisis. Muscle biopsy in ICU paralysis syndromes may be helpful in arriving at a specific diagnosis or to classify the type of critical illness myopathy. Nerve biopsy is only rarely indicated.",

In the great majority of cases consciousness remains unclouded, judgment fairly clear, memory good and the moral sense normal, until the end or very near the end. Emotional control, when we consider that almost always the patient, if an adult, knows he is suffering from a very serious disease, is usually better than would be expected. When, then, mental symptoms do occur, three questions arise: (1) Is the abnormal mental state a mere accidental complication, merely happening at the time of the tetanus and in no way caused by it? (2) Is it due to the medication employed? (3) Is it the direct result of the exhaustion produced by the disease or a result of a secondary intoxication set up by the primary intoxication of the tetanus bacillus?

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

Taste distortion or loss involves an impairment of this interaction and may be defined as dysgeusia (taste distortion), hypogeusia (reduced ability to taste), or ageusia (complete inability to taste). Medications have been reported to induce reversible and persistent taste disturbance in many patients. The mechanism by which medications alter taste is unknown, but there are many hypotheses. Patients may react to taste disturbances with decreased appetite, decreased dietary and nutrient intake, and/or increased use of salt or sugar. Management of taste disorders often includes discontinuation of the suspected offending agent.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Cardiovascular agents can be associated with a negative effect on cognition, especially in older adults, critically ill people, and those with baseline cognitive impairment. Negative effect on cognition is commonly reported as uncomplicated acute confusion and delirium and, less commonly, chronic cognitive changes due to drug-induced depression and/or dementia. Methods: A literature review of case reports, case series, prospective cohort studies, clinical trials, and literature reviews were included in this study. Articles were located using online databases PubMed and Medline using the following keywords: antiarrhythmic agents, anticholinergic burden, antihypertensive agents, beta-blockers, cardiovascular agents, cognitive impairment, delirium, cognition, dementia, depression, digoxin, diuretics, and drug-induced cognitive impairment. Results: In general, use of all antihypertensives, especially in the case of polypharmacy or inappropriate dosing, can lead to hypotension and/or bradycardia, and thus lead to mental/cognitive status change due to decreased cerebral perfusion. Use of diuretics can be associated with fluid/electrolyte and/or acid-base imbalance, resulting in the onset of confusion and delirium. In addition, cardiovascular agents with central bioavailability, such digoxin and select antiarrhythmics, and antihypertensives may carry a risk for cognitive impairment due to various mechanisms proposed, such as antagonism of central muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, neurotransmission imbalance in the brain, and disruption of physiologic function of sodium/potassium ATPase in the neuronal cells. Discussion: When dealing with an individual who presents with acute, subacute, and chronic changes in cognitive function, one should perform a thorough medication history as the first step in order to aid in the identification of drug-induced cognitive impairment.",

Se disena un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo que busca precisar sus caracteristicas. Material y metodo. Se registran los fenomenos clinicos en 61 pacientes consumidores de PBC, consultantes espontaneos de un centro tratamiento de adicciones en una comuna popular de Santiago, elegidos de modo aleatorio. Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia. Es una adiccion condicionada ya que la conducta compulsiva solo aparece como respuesta a estimulos externos (principalmente la posesion de dinero) o internos (cambios animicos o la fantasia de estar fumando). En un mismo individuo existen patones de consumo muy diferentes en un breve lapso de tiempo. Rapidamente se desarrolla sensibilizacion (hipertonia y estereotipias motoras, paranoia, ilusiones auditivas, visuales y cenestesicas, que son sintomas transitorios y vinculados al estado de intoxicacion aguda) y tolerancia (disminucion y desaparicion del efecto euforizante). La sensibilizacion y la tolerancia aparecen simultaneamente y en conjunto con la conducta compulsiva. Cada episodio de consumo por lo general termina con intensos sentimientos de culpa, ansiedad y aun ideas suicidas. Existen una frecuente perdida de normativas sociales y la constitucion de un sindrome psicopatico. Conclusiones. el consumo de PBC se cine a patrones de conducta muy variables pero siempre condicionadas a estimulos internos y externos, con poca o ninguna relacion con la euforia, sugiriendo un fenomeno asociado a la neurobiologia del aprendizaje",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

      "abstract": "In Italy, as in other countries, an apparently increasing number of subjects is reporting a variety of subjective symptoms that the subjects themselves refer to the exposure to electric, magnetic or electromagnetic fields (EMF) from nearby electric appliances, cellular phones, antennas, etc. Terms like electricity hypersensitivity (EHS), EMF hypersensitivity, or other similar, are frequently adopted to describe such symptoms; nevertheless, up to now, these terms are not entered the medical terminology. No accepted diagnostic criteria or procedures for the diagnosis of EHS are currently available. Furthermore, apart from the subject's self-attribution of the symptoms to EMFs, no direct cause-effect relationship between EHS symptoms and electromagnetic fields has been proved; additionally, evidence of a possible pathogenetic mechanism is lacking. In this paper, two cases developing symptoms of EHS ascribed to overhead power line in the proximity of their house are discussed. Nervous system (asthenia, depression, paraesthesias etc.), cardiovascular system (cardiac palpitations) and the skin (tingling, itching, etc.), are mostly (but not exclusively) involved. Based on available scientific knowledge, the rationale for an approach to subjects claiming for EHS is discussed. The establishment of a National archive for the collection of cases is communicated.",

      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

      "abstract": "One of the commonest neurological development disorders is the syndrome of inattention with hyperactivity, ADHD. The complex neurobiological network which intervenes in paying attention permits us to maintain a basal state of alertness, to focalize and maintain attention for long periods, select the stimulus-signal required and analyze its components, and also to simultaneously carry out processes of input-output and performance (tutorial, controlling).Damage to the various systems participating in 'paying attention' leads to a syndrome of inattention, with or without hyperactivity. The distinction into clinical sub-types (combined, mainly lacking attention or mainly hyperactive and impulsive) gives a primary differentiation of the syndrome. However, from the neuropsychological point of view, some degree of heterogeneity within the groups which defines academic behaviour and conduct may also be recognized. This type of study permits a more specific neuro-cognitive and pharmacological approach. Some clinical characteristics of the syndrome of inattention improve with different drugs, such as the state of alterness (methylphenidate), impulsivity (pipamperone) and selective attention (tiapride). However, this treatment is symptomatic and in most cases is useful to accompany the ultimate biological development of the neocortical control mechanisms.A neuro-cognitive approach which permits acquisition of habits of control, functional strategies, sequential planning of activities and per- and post-functional surveillance is fundamental. The EFE programme for training executive functions is directed towards working with the damaged processing mechanisms in each neuropsychological subtype.",

      "title": "“Neuropsychiatric manifestation of hyponatremia: a case report”",
      "abstract": "Introduction “Electrolyte abnormalities are commonly encountered in daily clinical practice, and their diagnosis relies on routine laboratory results. Electrolyte disturbances can affect the brain among many other organs and tissues and must be promptly recognized, as they can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications if neglected or not appropriately treated. Neurological manifestations reflect the severity of acute neuronal dysfunction and thus require urgent treatment. Acute and/or severe electrolyte imbalances can manifest with rapidly progressive neurological symptoms, seizures, and psychiatric manifestations. They are more frequently observed in patients with sodium disorders (especially hyponatremia), hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Objectives Were the psychiatric manifestations secondary to hyponatremia or epilepsy? Or is it a comorbidity? What are the risk factors? And what is the appropriate course of action for this type of patient?” Methods We present, through a clinical case, the situation of a 64-year-old patient who experienced status epilepticus secondary to hyponatremia, requiring hospitalization in the neurology department. Subsequently, she developed psychiatric manifestations with a marked change in behavior. She began experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depressive mood, headaches, somatic complaints, and social isolation. Her condition gradually worsened, necessitating hospitalization in the psychiatry department 3 years later. Results The patient was placed on Carbamazepine by her neurologist, and since then, she has not experienced epileptic seizures. Her follow-up electrolyte panel initially showed slight disturbances before normalizing. Psychiatric manifestations were concurrent with these somatic symptoms and worsened over time. During her psychiatric hospitalization three years later, after a thorough evaluation, she was prescribed Sertraline ans Risperidone in combination with Carbamazepine, resulting in a significant improvement in her condition. Conclusions In summary, this case illustrates the critical impact of electrolyte abnormalities on both neurological and psychiatric health, especially in older patients. Understanding risk factors associated with electrolyte imbalances is crucial for effective diagnosis and management, particularly in the elderly. This underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address the potential serious consequences of electrolyte disturbances on overall patient well-being.

      "abstract": "The clinical approach to evaluation and management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) involves taking an accurate history, prospective daily symptom monitoring to establish the diagnosis, patient-specific initial medical or psychological therapy, and adequate follow-up with appropriate alterations in the treatment plan. A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

      "abstract": "Summary Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of non‐rapid eye movement (non‐REM) sleep. Non‐REM parasomnia behaviours have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream‐like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterise the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental (dis)connection associated with behavioural episodes, 35 adult patients with non‐REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in‐depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviours (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterised by delusional thinking to varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni‐ or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%), and variable, but often pronounced, amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (“awake dreaming”). The surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people), or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness, amnesia and sensory disconnection during non‐REM parasomnia episodes is variable and graded. In their full‐fledged expression, non‐REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep‐related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "title": "Escitalopram-induced extrapyramidal symptoms",
      "abstract": "Sir, Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for a variety of clinical conditions due to their relatively safe side-effect profile. Among the various classes of antidepressants, SSRIs are the common offenders producing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs). The incidence of EPS is high with escitalopram (12%) followed by sertraline (11%), paroxetine (10%), and fluoxetine (8%).[1] The SSRIs produces reversible or irreversible motor disturbances through pathophysiological changes in basal ganglion motor system by altering the dopamine receptors postsynaptically.[2] A 34-year-old female presented with complaints of sadness of mood, crying spells, feeling lonely, decreased interest in day-to-day activities, lethargy and disturbed biological functions for the last 6 months. Her past and family history and personal history was noncontributory. General and systemic examination was within normal limits. Mental status examination revealed decreased psychomotor activity, depressed affect, depressive cognitions with well-preserved insight. A diagnosis of moderate depressive disorder was made, and she was started on escitalopram 10 mg/day along with clonazepam 0.5 mg at night time. She was maintaining well and escitalopram 10 mg was continued for the next 18 months as per patient's request. 18th month, she presented with complaints of slurring of speech, drooling of saliva, decreased bodily movements, and slowness in walking. Neurological examination revealed bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, dysarthric speech, and tremor of hands. Routine biochemical tests and head MRI, EEG were done and were found to be normal. No history of any other drug use/abuse, head injury, seizures, fever or movement disorder was reported. A diagnosis of escitalopram-induced acute extrapyramidal syndrome was made after excluding other possible causes. Escitalopram was immediately discontinued, the patient was reassured, and trihexyphenidyl 2 mg bid was started. Follow-up after 2 weeks reported significant improvement. Subsequently trihexyphenidyl was stopped and dothiepin 50 mg/day was started to control the depressive symptoms. The patient was followed-up for the next 6 months without any symptom recurrence. The Naranjo probability scale applied retrospectively revealed a score of 6, pointing to a \"probable\" drug reaction. The data for escitalopram-induced EPS is rare except in few cases.[34] The potential risk factors for EPS induced by antidepressants are advancing age, female gender, preexisting extrapyramidal disorder, other concurrent neuroleptic medications and pharmacokinetic interaction through CYP2D6 inhibition.[1] Other than the female gender, none of these risk factors were present in our patient. Researchers have extrapolated a link between antidepressant-induced EPS and the CYP2D6 phenotype. On analyzing the risk factors for these reactions during treatment with SSRIs, including the CYP2D6 phenotype, serotonin, and dopamine transporter and receptor polymorphisms, it was noted that the risk of EPS with SSRIs seemed to increase with advanced age and the presence of the A1 allele of the dopamine D2 receptor gene Taq1A.[5] Being a young patient, the possibility of young-onset parkinsonian disease was considered in which, family history of parkinsonism is an important risk factor.[6] Our patient's history was not significant for either parkinsonism or any other movement disorder. In rat models of EPS induced by SSRIs, a specific effect on tyrosine hydroxylase, which is a speed-limiting enzyme of dopamine synthesis in substantia nigra has been reported. Tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis was significantly decreased by SSRIs in substantia nigra, and the serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibition can activate microglia and alter the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis, and these changes may play a role in mediating the EPS associated with SERT inhibitors.[7] Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) may represent a preexisting vulnerability to future Parkinson's disease. Treatment of DIP involves discontinuation of the offending drugs, which usually promotes remission of the parkinsonian syndrome within a short time, although parkinsonism may sometimes persist and require dopaminergic treatment. One atypical feature in our patient was that compared to previously reported cases where EPS developed few weeks after initiation of escitalopram, in the index patient EPS developed only 2 years after starting escitalopram. However, the EPS was reversed after a short course of anticholinergic treatment. The reason for late onset of EPS needs further exploration. This is an attempt to create an awareness of drug-induced EPS as adverse reaction in patients taking escitalopram even after months or years of therapy so that timely recognition can prevent such adverse effects.

While physical dependence is linked to withdrawal syndrome, psychic dependence, on the Author's opinion, is related to a long-standing previous state of true or masked endogenous depression (in this case it would be well termed as \"neuropsychological dependence\"), and the drug taking is only a maladaptive self-medication. This thesis is substantiated by the literature, reporting, in chronic drug addicts the use of the whole series of antidepressants (i.e. tricyclics, doxepine, lithium, etc.), with noticeable therapeutical success. According with other reports and with personal experience, the Authors maintain a great importance to drugs acting, directly or not, on GABA, i.e. l-glutamine, piracetam, and, particularly, N-dipropilacetic acid.",

This rare condition is called summation anaphylaxis (SA). Food‐dependent exercise‐induced anaphylaxis is the most well‐known SA. However, SA may also occur with the association between food and/or exercise plus one or more of the following other cofactors, such as drugs, especially non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAID), alcohol, infections, temperature variation, and menstrual cycle. SA can explain some cases of idiopathic anaphylaxis, as well as cases of an apparent breakdown in a previously acquired tolerance for food, or finally, when faced with a suggestive clinical history of food allergy or exercise anaphylaxis and the provocation test is negative. In these situations, a more careful clinical history looking for other cofactors is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Difficulty sleeping can become a chronic condition that interacts with other medical conditions and puts people at increased risk for depression, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, including first time myocardial infarction. Therapists can play a crucial role in helping people improve the quality and quantity of sleep by providing psychoeducation about good sleep hygiene, environmental variables that impact sleep, and treating mental health problems that exacerbate, or result from, sleep difficulties. DSM-5 includes a new classification for Sleep-Wake Disorders, which contains the same basic subtypes of sleep disorders as DSM-IV , with some modifications. The sleep-wake disorders in DSM-5 include: insomnia disorder, hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorder, parasomnias, non-rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorder, nightmare disorder, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, substance/medication-induced sleep disorder, and other specified and unspecified sleep-wake disorders.",

      "abstract": "Les recommandations du NICE reposent pour l’essentiel sur le consensus professionnel du groupe de travail. Elles sont cependant ici une aide precieuse a la decision. L’enuresie nocturne (plus de 2 fois par semaine) toucherait 8 % des enfants de moins de 4 ans et demi et 1,5 % des enfants de moins de 9 ans et demi. Elle peut persister jusqu’a 19 ans… Le NICE rappelle qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une « faute» et que les « punitions » n’ont aucun role therapeutique… Il faut donc d’abord informer les enfants et leurs familles et leur donner des conseils pratiques immediats pour limiter l’impact (protections et vetements de nuit adaptes). Une enuresie recente doit faire rechercher une infection urinaire ou un diabete ; apres quelques mois de possibles facteurs declenchants (maladie recente, trouble emotionnel…) qui peuvent necessiter une prise en charge specifique. L’evaluation est multifactorielle (symptomes de jour, autres problemes, notamment de constipation, troubles du developpement, du comportement, de l’attention ou de l’apprentissage, problemes familiaux…). Une evaluation en milieu specialise peut etre indispensable en cas d’incontinence diurne, d’antecedents d’infection urinaire, d’anomalies congenitales ou de troubles comportementaux majeurs, notamment en cas de suspicion de maltraitance. Le NICE recommande de ne pas restreindre les apports hydriques de la journee, ne pas reveiller l’enfant la nuit, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, de lui rappeler d’utiliser les toilettes a heures regulieres durant la journee. La place des differents traitements alarmes, desmopressine en premiere intention, recours a un avis specialise en cas d’echec avant utilisation d’anticholinergiques ou d’imipramine, est bien precisee. Le NICE rappelle qu’il est habituellement inutile d’envisager un traitement avant l’âge de 7 ans, meme si certaines mesures peuvent etre envisagees a partir de 5 ans. 1.

The disorders associated with behaviors while asleep (parasomnias) are: sleep terrors and sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder. Injury can result from behaviors that occur during sleep. The patient's ability to recall the episode depends partly on the type of the parasomnia (occurrence during non-REM versus REM sleep). The other sleep disorders are recurrent hypersomnia and insomnia. Insomnia can result from multiple causes including psychiatric or general medical disorders, medication effects, substance abuse, and other sleep disorders. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is another important cause of insomnia. RLS is thought to be related to periodic limb movement disorder and is characterized by lower extremity dysesthesias that occur at rest.",

These disturbances include depression, anxiety, psychotic disorders, and cognitive and personality changes occurring in the inter-ictal or peri-ictal (pre-ictal, ictal, post-ictal) states. We focus on four areas in patients with epilepsy: (1) more frequent comorbid psychiatric disorders, (2) integrated symptoms secondary to epilepsy, (3) stigma and psychosocial consequences of epilepsy, and (4) non-epileptic seizures. In this chapter, we will call attention to pertinent elements of the history in the patient with seizures, diagnostic work-up, assessment of comorbidities, and consequences of treatment of the seizure disorder (including medications, resective surgery, and neuromodulation) and of the psychiatric comorbidity.",

Some medications and psychotherapies including hypnotherapy have been used in various situations. In this study, the hypnotherapy was used on a 46-year-old female patient. Method : She had been suffering from insomnia, nightmares, and sleepwalking for over a year. Through hypnotherapy, she was able to express her anger towards people who had hurt her in the past. Also, through regression and trance logic, she was able to reconcile with her mother who had passed away. Result and Conclusion : As a result, her sleepwalking disappeared and other psychological problems such as depression and anxiety were reduced effectively.",

These include atypical changes in perception (positive and negative hallucinations), pain (analgesia), memory (amnesia) and the experience of volition. Some behaviours may appear to occur without volitional control (ideomotor suggestion) whilst others occur despite volitional control (challenge suggestion). The considerable effects of hypnotic suggestion on somatic physiology have been successfully applied to the treatment of a variety of medical disorders, i.e. the effects of hypnosis may be observed in phenomenological, behavioural and physiological data. Historically, research paradigms in hypnosis have emphasized methodologies largely restricted to one or another of these possible data sets.",

      "title": "Developmental delay and epilepsy",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Developmental delay can be associated with epilepsy. Epilepsy might be either the cause of the delay of acquisitions (epileptogenic encephalopathy) or only one additional manifestation, the consequence of the underlying neurological pathology (encephalopathy with epilepsy); it is therefore not the only factor responsible for delay. Within the framework of encephalopathies with epilepsy a rigorous diagnosis is necessary with, in particular a cutaneous examination (neuro‐cutaneous syndromes), a precise clinical examination (anoxo‐ischaemic sequelae of the perinatal period), an EEG, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as the search for associated abnomalities (cardiac, renal…). There are also epileptogenic encephalopathies such as age‐related syndromes: Hemiconvulsions‐Hemiplegia‐Epilepsy syndrome; Rasmussen's syndrome; Dravet's syndrome; myoclono‐astatic epilepsy (Doose). Age at onset and type of seizures, as well as ictal and interictal EEG finding provide valuable hints for a specific diagnosis, while other investigation are usually not contributive. Developmental delay and epilepsy are frequently associated. One of the first steps to diagnosis consists in trying to establish the eventual causal role of the epilepsy. Answering this question may prove to be of primary importance for the choice of a therapeutic strategy and/or further etiological investigations.",

Many of the same effects are reported in normals after harmine and Nalline (other workers). unlike mescaline and LSD at usual dosage levels, the present psychotomimetics regularly produce drowsiness and sleep along with the aberrant mental effects. The resultant state is partly that of \"hypnagogic\" visual hallucinations or imagery. The results with increased dosage suggest that the basic effect of these agents is to produce an acute toxic reaction type. The difference between them and mescaline or LSD with respect to clouding of consciousness and certain aspects of the hallucinogenic response may be quantitative rather than qualitative. The indole nucleus is not necessary in the structure of psychotomimetics since Win-2299 and Nalline are non-indoles. The tertiary nitrogen grouping may contribute to certain aspects of psychotomimetic action.",

Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

Nevertheless, the historical accounts of the properties of marijuana have provided an impetus for modern investigations on the effects and potential therapeutic uses of marijuana, its constituents, and their analogs. A seizure is a paroxysmal event that consists of a transient distortion of normal electrical activity in the brain and some alteration of normal motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic function. Convulsions subsequent to cannabinoid administration have been reported to occur under certain conditions in \"normal\" animals, genetically seizure-susceptible animals, and experimentally seizure-susceptible animals. Convulsions subsequent to relatively low-dose administration of cannabinoids can occur in animals rendered seizure susceptible by some experimental techniques. Gammaaminobutyric acid deficiency may be involved in chorea, tardive dyskinesia, and spasticity, and serotonin deficiency in postanoxic myoclonus and perhaps in other neurological disorders.",

      "title": "#3095 Rapid anti-obsessive treatments of obsessive-compulsive disorder: reviewing effects of ketamine in OCD",
      "abstract": "Objectives/Aims Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common neuropsychiatric condition characterised by persistent endogenous repetitive and intrusive anxiogenic thoughts, feelings, or images often followed by anxiolytic mental or physical actions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the mainstay of OCD treatment, used both as first line (SSRIs) and second line (Clomipramine) approaches. Despite their effectiveness in treatment of OCD, their anti-obsessive effects only start at eight to 12 weeks into treatment (Pittenger &amp; Bloch, 2014), leaving an effectiveness time gap between diagnosis and treatment. Various treatment strategies have been tried but there is no consensus on the most effective approach. A single pharmacological agent with rapid anti-obsessive action would be an ideal candidate to manage this treatment gap. One such agent may be ketamine with its novel mechanism of action. Ketamine is assumed to increase neuroplasticity by synthesising neurotrophins in the cortex and has demonstrated to have rapid-onset anti-depressant effects (Bjrkholm &amp; Monteggia, 2016). We reviewed the state of evidence for similar rapidly emerging anti- obsessive effects and report our findings here. Methods Embase, MEDLINE(R), and PsycINFO were searched to identify studies investigating rapid anti-obsessive effects of ketamine in humans, available in English. ClinicalTrials.org was further searched for grey literature. Other reviews were excluded. Results 181 studies were identified after deduplication of which nine studies met inclusion criteria. Eight studies revealed rapid anti-obsessive effects, five of which display statistical significance. Combined, OCD scores decline by approximately 49.7% during the first hour following intravenous ketamine administration. Furthermore, a significant reduction of depressive symptoms and suicidality were reported in studies further investigating comorbid depression. Contrary to depression scores, anti-obsessive effects were not sustained. OCD scores increased within three hours post-administration and reversed back to baseline within seven days. One trial reported an extended length and margin of effect when combined with cognitive behavioural therapy. All studies were of small scale as the literature search primarily yielded pilot trials and case reports, suggesting statistical imprecision and reflecting the topics novelty. Conclusions Our review points out the presence of preliminary research evidence to support the presence of anti-obsessive effects of ketamine and a potential for its usefulness as a rapidly acting intervention for OCD, thereby plugging an important gap in clinical management of OCD. However, as such effects are unsustained, their potential to complement existing pharmacological strategies may be limited. Greater awareness and randomised controlled trials are required before recommending the use of ketamine in OCD treatment. References Bjrkholm C, Monteggia LM.

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

      "abstract": "Patients with mental disorders exhibit a range of abnormal movements. The severely depressed are given to hand wringing, pacing, and restlessness. Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Dissociative amnesia represents the classical functional disorder of episodic memory. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDRD) involves lack of integration of one or more components of perception and characterizes by \"the presence of recurrent or persistent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both\".

Pischacha grahonmada (PG) is one among those 18 types. No works are available on PG till date. The concept of PG and its clinical application is unclear due to the scarcity of published literature on this topic. The aim of the present study is to explore the condition of PG in terms of contemporary psychiatric literature. Ayurvedic literature pertaining to \"Pishacha grahonmada\" has been collected from major classical Ayurvedic texts and their commentaries. Electronic databases have been searched to find out the relevant psychiatric and/or neuropsychiatric conditions which are similar to PG by using relevant keywords. PG is characterized by clinical features like Aswastha chittam (feeling uneasy), naikatra tishtantam (unable to sit at one place), paridhaavinam (wandering/pacing/running), dayita nritya geeta haasa ucchishta ratim (hypomania or mania like features), madya maamsa ratim (fond of eating meat, alcohol abuse), shunya nivaasa ratim (staying alone/social withdrawal), nirbhartsanaat (threatening others), deena shankita vadanam (depression with suspiciousness), nakhai aatma vapushi likhantam (self-injurious behavior with nails), nashta smriti (memory loss), baddhaabaddha bhaashinam (irrelevant speech), akasmaat rudantam (crying suddenly), dukhaani aavedayamaana (sharing his sorrows to everyone)/dukhaani avedayamaana (unable to feel pain), uddhvasta (nakedness), rooksha deha and swara (rough emaciated body and voice), durgandham/ashuchi (unhygienic), rathya chaila trina aabharanam (gross abnormal behavior), and bahvaashinam (hyperphagia). \"Nashta smriti\" is the unique symptom of PG and it denotes memory impairment commonly seen in conditions like dementia. The clinical features of PG have shown similarity with \"Frontotemporal dementia\" associated with malnutrition and/or Vitamin B12 deficiency.

      "abstract": "Principles of benzodiazepine selection are outlined for various psychiatric indications and diverse populations (the elderly, and drug and alcohol abusers). Benzodiazepines are still among the most commonly used classes of medications, and they differ in their pharmacodynamic properties. They have varied uses as monotherapy or as adjunctive medication because of their efficacy in the treatment of conditions involving a dysfunction of the GABAergic system or where neuronal inhibition is required. In multiple therapy, benzodiazepines augment the efficacy of other drugs such as lithium in mania, antipsychotics in psychotic agitation and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in panic disorder. Benzodiazepines can produce dependence and tolerance in most patients; predisposed individuals are at greater risk. Short- and intermediate-beta half-life compounds carry a greater risk of rebound and withdrawal reactions, and drug dependence than long acting agents. Adverse effects include sedation, psychomotor and cognitive impairment, memory loss, potentiation of other central nervous system depressants and treatment-emergent depression. Drug potency and beta elimination half-life are reviewed and compared as pharmacokinetic variables.",

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction.

In this article, the last of a four-part series, the discontinuation effects of the following psychotropic drugs are described: benzodiazepine drugs (which have hypnotic, anti-anxiety, and anticonvulsant effects), non-benzodiazepine drugs (used for insomnia), glutamate-modulating drugs, opioid receptor agonist drugs (used as analgesics for the treatment of various pain conditions), and stimulant drugs. Serious adverse effects are likely to occur only after abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepine drugs, and they should almost always be tapered. Prominent discontinuation effects are seen with opioid and stimulant drugs, but these are usually not serious. Tapering medication, rather than abruptly stopping them, can avoid or minimize the potential adverse discontinuation effects associated with most psychotropic drugs.",

      "title": "[Brain-gut interactions in irritable bowel syndrome: physiological and psychological aspect].",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in the investigation of brain-gut interaction in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were reviewed. Brain is suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of IBS on the basis of the following evidence. (1) Stress often induces major symptoms of IBS patients (Drossman et al., 1982), simultaneously with colonic hypermotility (Fukudo et al., 1987) or dysmotility of the small intestine (Kumar et al., 1985). (2) IBS patients rarely express symptoms or small intestinal dysmotility during sleep (Kellow et al., 1990). (3) IBS patients complain of more pain with balloon distension of the colon or rectum than normal controls; visceral perception is enhanced in IBS (Whitehead et al., 1990). (4) IBS patients often show psychoneurotic symptoms and extra-colonic somatic symptoms (Young et al., 1976). (5) There are some animal (Williams et al, 1987) or human (Dinan et al, 1990) experiments which indicate the possible involvement of brain peptide or brain monoamine in IBS. (6) Dysrhythmia or increased beta power in electroencephalogram is observed more often in IBS patients than in the normal controls (Fukudo et al, 1991) in addition to abnormal REM sleep in IBS patients (Kumar et al., 1992). These observations support our hypothesis that not only the gut but also the brain show dysfunction and exaggerated responsivity to the stimuli in IBS. Further research on brain-gut interaction in IBS is warranted.",

      "title": "Practical Approach for the Diagnosis and Management of Insomnia During Menopausal Transition",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Several nonpharmacological treatment methods of insomnia and their effects were reviewed. A long-term use of most hypnotics may produce tolerance, dependence, cognitive and psychomotor impairments at daytime, shallow sleep, and rebound insomnia on drug withdrawal. To reduce hypnotic abuse, nonpharmacological strategies have been developed to correct disordered behavioral and cognitive factors. These treatments aim at modifying maladaptive sleep habits, lowering physiological and cognitive arousal levels, and correcting dysfuctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep. These non-pharmacological or cognitive behavior treatments include stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation training, sleep hygiene education, cognitive therapy, and light therapy. Among them the stimulus control therapy has been demonstrated most effective as a single treatment or in combination with other treatments. Through nonpharmacological treatments, sleep latency was most significantly reduced and wake time after sleep onset was also reduced. About 50% of insomniacs reported clinical improvements in terms of nearly normalized sleep latency, awakening time, sleep efficiency, and reduction of hypnotic use. Compared to the hypnotic therapy, nonpharmacological treatments are more cost-effective and more readily accepted by patients, and their effects last longer.",

Notably absent were the behavioral aberrations such as aggression, which are usually seen with PCP intoxication in older children and adults. The possibility of drug intoxication was denied by most of the parents or surrogate parents accompanying these small children and infants for treatment.

The physician involved in the care of these patients knows that the disease may present itself also with extramotor symptoms, which condition a more difficult management of the patient. The non-motor symptoms are classified in four categories in order of management importance: 1) disautonomic, 2) cognitive, 3) affective and 4) sensitive. These symptoms are more frequent and difficult to manage in late stage of disease, except for affective type, which may be precox and adaptive at the communication of the diagnosis or sometime precede it. The more frequent disautonomic symptoms are: constipation, symptoms related to the uro-genital sphere, the cardio-pressor regulation (orthostatic hypotension), the thermoregulation, sialorrhea dysphagia and seborrhoea. The cognitive symptoms: isolate (bradyphrenia, alteration of executive function) or dementia with or without delirium and allucinosis. The affective symptoms: depression, agitation, anxiety, panic attacks. The sensitive symptoms: pain, dysesthesia, paresthesia with bizzarre features (cold sensation, numbness, interior agitation). There are other symptoms which are not framing in the previous categories: sleep, respiratory and circulatory disorders (venous and lymphatic), which have different causal factors: emotional-affective, motor and iatrogenic.

      "title": "The “new syndrome excuse syndrome”",
      "abstract": "I Introduction Behavioral science is on the march. Psychiatrists and psychologists are identifying an ever-proliferating and often bewildering array of new syndromes or disorders. Some have received the clinical and scientific imprimatur of actual inclusion the American Psychiatric Association's official diagnostic manual, referred to as DSM-IV.(2) Examples of the diagnostically respectable disorders include: Antisocial Personality Disorder,(3) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,(4) Intermittent Explosive Disorder,(5) Kleptomania, and Pathological Gambling.(6) DSM-IV characterizes other categories as in need of further study because their existence as discrete psychopathological entities is not yet sufficiently validated to warrant inclusion the manual.(7) Examples Postconcussional Disorder,(8) Caffeine Withdrawal,(9) and Dysphoric Disorder(10) (which was formerly termed Premenstrual Syndrome or PMS and, later, Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder). Finally, and least respectably, some alleged syndromes have not received general provisional recognition as valid, but are advocated with varying degrees of success by clinicians and researchers who have supposedly identified them. Examples from the last group, which have been chosen from the mental health and legal literatures and from legal cases, where they often arise, include, Battered Woman Syndrome,(11) Vietnam Syndrome,(12) Sexual Abuse Syndrome,(13) Holocaust Survivor Syndrome,(14) Urban Survival Syndrome,(15) Rotten Social Background,(16) and Adopted Child Syndrome.(17) Diagnostic identification, research, and advocacy are unproblematic if they are confined within the mental health professionals' domain. Although the concepts of mental and behavioral abnormality are hotly contested, human suffering is potentially involved, and we will all probably benefit from activities aimed at acquiring valid knowledge of how our mental and behavioral nature is carved at the joints. But swept away by the torrent of science and, alas, pseudo-science concerning alleged new syndromes, many people now suffer from yet another new that I have identified, or at least given a name: the Syndrome Excuse Syndrome. The primary diagnostic criterion for this is an almost irresistible impulse to use the alleged discovery of syndromes of mental abnormality as good reason to alter the criminal law. Those suffering from the new include many members of the criminal defense bar, properly seeking any possible purchase to exonerate defendants, legal commentators, some mental health professionals, and some judges and legislatures. Courts and, less often, legislatures are increasingly inundated with claims that syndromes old and new, validated and unvalidated, should be the basis for two types of legal change. The first is the creation of new affirmative defenses. Examples are claims for the creation of a discrete battered victim or urban survivor syndrome defense. The second change proposal is the expansion of old defenses: for example, loosening objective standards for justifications such as self-defense. All too often, I fear, the new syndromes are not sufficiently validated and are the product of unacceptably soft science or clinical crockery. Nevertheless, this paper will not discuss the pseudo-science problem. Instead, it will accept the validity of some of the new syndromes or some yet to be discovered syndromes because the legal issues are theoretically and practically important only if claimed new syndromes do have reasonable validity. Consequently, this article win assume away the scientific and clinical problems and will focus on the conceptual difficulties and policy dilemmas the New Syndrome Excuse Syndrome presents.

      "title": "The burden of narcolepsy symptoms from patients’ perspective: a narrative qualitative study",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

      "title": "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor-Induced Serotonin Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The selective pharmacology of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) results in a lower potential for pharmacodynamic drug interactions relative to other antidepressants such as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).However, the SSRIs have been implicated in the development of the serotonin syndrome-a potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with psychotropic drugs. The syndrome is produced most often by the concurrent use of two or more drugs that enhance central nervous system serotonin activity and often goes unrecognized because of the varied and nonspecific nature of its clinical features. The serotonin syndrome is characterized by alterations in cognition (disorientation, confusion), behavior (agitation, restlessness), autonomic nervous system function (fever, shivering, diaphoresis, diarrhea), and neuromuscular (ataxia, hyperreflexia, myoclonus) activity. The difference between this syndrome and the occurrence of adverse effects caused by serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone is the clustering of the signs and symptoms, their severity, and their duration. There are important pharmacokinetic interactions between SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs due principally to their effects on the cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes, the potential for which varies widely amongst the SSRI group, which may increase the likelihood of a pharmacodynamic interaction. The exceptionally long washout period required after fluoxetine discontinuation may cause additional problems and/or inconvenience. Patients with serotonin syndrome usually respond to discontinuation of drug therapy and supportive care alone, but they may also require treatment with an antiserotonergic agent such as cyproheptadine, methysergide, and/or propranolol. To reduce the occurrence, morbidity, and mortality of the serotonin syndrome, it must be both prevented by prudent pharmacotherapy and given prompt recognition when it is present.

      "title": "The Management of Preoperative Anxiety in Children: An Update",
      "abstract": "Anxiety in children undergoing surgery is characterized by subjective feelings of tension, apprehension, nervousness, and worry that may be expressed in various forms (1). Postoperative maladaptive behaviors, such as new onset enuresis, feeding difficulties, apathy and withdrawal, and sleep disturbances, may also result from anxiety before surgery. In fact, studies have indicated that up to 60% of all children undergoing surgery may present with negative behavioral changes at 2 wk postoperatively (1,2). Variables such as age, temperament, and anxiety of the child and parent in the preoperative holding area have been identified as predictors for these behavioral changes (1). Extreme anxiety during induction of anesthesia is also associated with an increase of these postoperative negative behavioral changes (3). In addition to behavioral manifestations, preoperative anxiety activates the human stress response, leading to increased serum cortisol, epinephrine, and natural killer cell activity (4,5). This stress response can be activated by many different noxious stimuli including fear, anxiety, pain, cold, major surgery, and infection. The main components of the stress system are the corticotropin-releasing hormone and the locus ceruleus-norepinephrine/autonomic systems and their peripheral effectors, the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis and the limbs of the autonomic system (5). There is also evidence for a bidirectional communication between the neuroendocrine system and the immune system. Stress activates the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis, increases circulating glucocorticoids, and is associated with alterations of immune function and susceptibility to infection and neoplastic disease (6). The human response to surgical stress is characterized by a series of hormonal, immunological, and metabolic changes that together constitute the global surgical stress response (7,8). This perioperative response is considered a homeostatic mechanism for adapting to the perioperative injury. The effects of the surgical stress response, however, may be detrimental: neuroendocrine hormones (e.g., cortisol, catecholamines) and cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6) provoke a negative nitrogen balance and catabolism, delay wound healing, and cause postoperative immunosuppression (7,8). Children are particularly vulnerable to the global surgical stress response because of limited energy reserves, larger brain masses, and obligatory glucose requirements (9). Because acute psychological stress, such as preoperative anxiety, is associated with immediate stress hormone release, the contribution of perioperative psychological factors to the global perioperative stress response cannot be ignored. In adults, increased preoperative anxiety is associated with poor postoperative behavioral and clinical recovery (10,11). As an indicator of the importance of preoperative anxiety, a panel of 72 anesthesiologists recently ranked various anesthesia low-morbidity clinical outcomes based on importance and frequency. The five clinical outcomes with the highest combined score were incisional pain, nausea, vomiting, preoperative anxiety, and discomfort from IV insertion (12). Thus, consensus is evident among anesthesiologists about the need to treat anxiety before surgery. In a modern epidemiological framework, diseases can be characterized in terms of risk factors, interventions, and outcomes. In this update, we will review preoperative anxiety in children using this conceptual framework (Fig. 1).Figure 1: Conceptual framework of perioperative anxiety. Revised from (72).The Psychobiology of Separation Learning to cope with separation from a parent is necessary for a child's normal development (13). Separation experiences such as going to school facilitate normal psychological development and personality organization. Other separation experiences, such as perioperative separation, may precipitate confusion and anxiety. Between these two extremes, there are many separation experiences with varying degrees of psychobiological stress. In the first weeks of life, infants are able to discriminate among people, but will accept care and comfort from adults other than their parents (14). By 3 mo of age, however, infants begin to respond differently to familiar and unfamiliar people. Older infants smile more at familiar people and may even try to engage their attention (14). Separation anxiety usually begins at 7–8 mo of age and peaks around 1 yr of age. In part, separation anxiety represents the infant's acquisition of new cognitive abilities and object permanence. The intensity of separation anxiety declines with age, largely because of increasing cognitive abilities and memory capacity. Frequently, however, the increase in abilities does not immunize toddlers and preschoolers against the stress and distress of separations. The extent to which separation is traumatic or evokes adaptive responses reflects an individual child's developmental age, parenting experiences, genetic endowment, and environmental stability. For children with biologically based vulnerabilities, such as a sensitivity to novelty and transitions, even expected separations may impose a greater degree of stress than for less sensitive children (13). How parents help the child mediate a separation experience play a crucial role in the child's acute and long-term responses. In the extreme, the parent may be unable to mediate the experience for the child because of limitations such as severe anxiety. How well children have been cared for up to the time of the separation also influences their response to the stressor. Children deprived of attention in the home are at increased risk for stress in response to separations. Thus, the extent to which separations evoke adaptive responses reflects an individual child's genetics, personality, parenting, and previous life experiences. Preoperative Anxiety: Identification Identifying risk factors for development of preoperative anxiety is important, as more resources can be directed toward vulnerable children. Children 1–5 yr old are at the highest risk for developing extreme anxiety (1). This is not surprising considering the psychobiology of separation anxiety. Children who are shy or inhibited and those who have a high intelligence quotient and lack good adaptive abilities are also at increased risk (15). Previous surgery or hospitalization and poor response to visits to the pediatrician's office are also predictors for the development of preoperative anxiety. Finally, parental anxiety has been identified as a predictor for increased child's anxiety. Preoperative Anxiety: Behavioral Modalities Preoperative Preparation Programs Most studies suggest that preoperative preparation programs reduce anxiety and enhance coping in children (16). These behavioral preparation programs have evolved significantly over recent decades. In the 1960s, preparation programs were designed to provide an orientation tour and narrative information and facilitate trust between the hospital staff, the child, and the parent (16). In the 1970s, modeling techniques were developed where children indirectly experienced the perioperative course by role rehearsal using dolls or by viewing a video (17). These modeling techniques were augmented in the late 1980s with child life preparation and the teaching of coping skills (17). Currently, development of coping skills is considered the most effective preoperative preparation intervention, followed by modeling, play therapy, operating room tour, and printed material (18). Although experts favor teaching of coping skills, most preparation programs in the United States consist of an orientation tour and printed information (18). Although coping preparation has been associated with reduction of anxiety in the preoperative holding area, no differences were found among the various preparation programs during induction, in the recovery room period, or postoperatively (19). Thus, the cost-effectiveness of child life specialists may or may not be justified by an associated reduction in preoperative anxiety. Psychological preparation programs should be tailored to individual needs such as age, developmental stage, and previous experience (20). The priority of the age criterion relates to both the anxiety such exposure might generate and the length of time over which children can cope with anticipation. In addition, timing of the program before surgery is an important variable (20). Children aged ≥6 yr benefit most if they participate in a preparation program ≥5 days before surgery and benefit least if the program is given only 1 day before surgery. This phenomenon is related to the way that children in this age group process new information. Finally, a child who has previously undergone surgery or has been hospitalized may develop an exaggerated emotional response to an information-based preparation program (20). As increased parental anxiety results in increased child's anxiety (1), there is a need for interventions that are designed specifically for parents. Cassady et al. (21) demonstrated that parental preoperative anxiety decreased after viewing an educational videotape. We suggest that more parental interventions need to be developed and that a child's anxiety should be evaluated as an outcome. Preoperative Anxiety: Behavioral Modalities Parental Presence during Induction of Anesthesia. Parents and children prefer to stay together during medical procedures such as immunizations, dental treatment, and induction of anesthesia (22). Some data indicate, however, that parental presence during induction of anesthesia (PPIA) is allowed in 26% of US hospitals and is encouraged in only 8% of hospitals (23). In contrast, 28% of hospitals have no formal hospital policy and parental presence is against hospital policy for 32% of hospitals in the US. The smallest use of this induction technique was reported in the South-Central region and the highest in the Northwest and the Northeast (23). Interestingly, anesthesiologists from Great Britain (GB) encourage PPIA significantly more than anesthesiologists from the US (23,24). The reasons for these differences may include the use of different induction techniques, less concern about legal ramifications in GB, and a stronger demand for parental presence in GB. Economic issues such as operating room (OR) efficiency, infrastructure issues, lack of induction rooms and patchy preoperative educational programs, probably limit the availability of PPIA in the US. Potential benefits from PPIA include reducing the need for preoperative sedatives and avoiding the fear and anxiety that may occur on separation to the OR. Other benefits, such as increasing the child's compliance during induction, remain controversial. Objections to PPIA include concern about disruption of the OR routine, crowded ORs, and a possible adverse reaction of parents. In addition, increased parental anxiety can increase a child's anxiety, prolong anesthetic induction, and place additional stress on the anesthesiologist. Although early observational studies suggested reduced anxiety if parents were present during induction (25), more recent randomized controlled trials indicate that routine parental presence is not beneficial (26–28). One study demonstrated that only children >4 yr of age, those who have a \"calm\" baseline personality, or those who have a parent with a \"calm\" baseline personality benefit from this intervention (26). When interpreting the results of these studies, however, it should be noted that the design of a randomized controlled study does not reflect the practice of all anesthesiologists. When data of survey studies are reviewed (23,24), it is noticed that most anesthesiologists use either PPIA or sedative premedication to treat preoperative anxiety. When sedative premedications were directly compared with PPIA, however, it was found that children receiving oral midazolam were significantly less anxious and more compliant during the induction process (27). A recent study examined whether a combination of PPIA and oral midazolam is more effective than oral midazolam alone (28). The investigators found that PPIA has no additive anxiolytic effects for children who received oral midazolam preoperatively. Parents who accompany their sedated children into the ORs, however, are significantly less anxious and more satisfied both with the separation process and with the overall anesthetic, nursing and surgical care provided (28). PPIA is also associated with important legal implications. Lewyn (29) described a case in which a mother was invited to accompany her son into an emergency treatment room. According to the court, the mother fainted and suffered an injury to the head. In its verdict the Illinois Supreme Court stated that a hospital, which allows a nonpatient to accompany a patient during treatment, does not have a duty to protect the nonpatient from fainting. However, if medical personnel invite the nonpatient to participate in the treatment, then the hospital has a legal responsibility toward the nonpatient. Interestingly, some hospitals in the US now require the parents to sign a written informed consent acknowledging the risk of being present during induction of anesthesia. We believe that future research interests should shift towards an emphasis on what parents actually do during induction of anesthesia, rather than simply on their presence. Allowing a parent into an OR without significant preparation may be counterproductive because some parent behaviors, such as criticism and commands, are associated with increased distress. Effective methods of training such as parental preparation programs can be developed for enhancing the effects of PPIA. Preoperative Anxiety: Pharmacological Modalities The reported rate of use of pharmacological modalities for the treatment of preoperative anxiety in the US varies widely among age groups and geographical locations (24). Premedicant sedative drugs are least often used with children <3 yr of age and most often used with adults <65 yr of age (25% vs 75%). Currently, the most commonly used sedative premedicant in the preoperative holding area is midazolam (85%), followed by ketamine (4%), transmucosal fentanyl (3%), and meperidine (2%) (Fig. 2). TABLETABLE The majority of children in the US are premedicated via the oral route (80%), followed by the intranasal route (8%), the IM route (6%), and the rectal route (3%).Figure 2: Types of premedicants used in the preoperative holding area (23).Table 1: Premedications Administered by the Oral RouteTable 2: Premedications Administered Transmucosally and RectallyMidazolam. Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is very lipophilic at physiologic pH, which accounts for its rapid onset of action. Davis et al. (30) has demonstrated that intranasally administered midazolam in a dosage of 0.2–0.3 mg/kg in patients undergoing myringotomies led to satisfactory separation from parents and a satisfactory induction over 70% of the time and did not prolong recovery time and hospital discharge time. Midazolam administered intranasally is effective in reducing anxiety in children within 10–12 min (31). A major drawback of intranasally administered midazolam, however, is that at least 50% of children cry on administration because it transiently irritates the nasal passages. Midazolam can also be given as a nasal spray, which is effective in reducing procedural anxiety in children undergoing cancer therapy (32). Midazolam can be administrated sublingually at the same dosage as intranasally. Although sublingual administration of midazolam is associated with a decreased incidence of crying (18%), it may be difficult to prevent small children from either swallowing the midazolam or spitting it out immediately (33). Rectal administration of midazolam in doses of 0.5–1.0 mg/kg effectively reduces the anxiety of children before induction of anesthesia (34). Although the incidence of hiccups after IV midazolam is <2%, the incidence noted that in a recent study involving rectally administered midazolam was more than 20%(34). The investigators had no explanation as to the increased rate of hiccups other than the young age of the children, but they found that the hiccups were easily treated by ethyl chloride nasal spray (34). Orally administered midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) has been shown to significantly reduce preoperative anxiety in young children (27,28). Orally administered midazolam can be given in a dosage of 0.25 mg to 1.0 mg/kg up to total dose of 20 mg depending on the duration of surgery and the anxiety level of the child. A commercially available and Food and Drug Administration-approved midazolam in a syrup form of 2 mg/mL became available in 1998. Suresh et al. (35) examined different doses of the commercially available midazolam and found that 0.25 mg/kg resulted in satisfactory sedation and anxiolysis in a majority of patients within 20 min. This study also found that increasing the dose resulted in an increase in the proportion of patients with satisfactory sedation and a shortened time to onset of action (35). Other authors report that the minimum time interval for successfully separating premedicated children from their parents is 10 min with a peak sedative effect occurring between 20 and 30 min (36). The issue of orally administered midazolam and delays in the discharge of patients is controversial. Although several recent studies noted that orally administrated midazolam is not associated with a delayed discharge (28,29,37), two studies involving children undergoing adenoidectomy report that emergence and recovery are delayed in the children who receive oral midazolam preoperatively (38,39). Another study involving children who underwent myringotomies using sevoflurane or halothane anesthesia indicated that children who were given oral midazolam experienced significant delays in recovery time but no delays in discharge time from the hospital (40). Finally, Martlew et al. (41) have addressed the issue of a combination of preoperative oral midazolam and propofol-based anesthetic. The investigators found that propofol infusion requirements decrease by one-third and discharge readiness was delayed in children who had been given midazolam preoperatively. The investigators suggested that the increased postoperative sedation may have been attributable to synergism of propofol and midazolam on GABA receptors (42). As indicated above, a significant proportion of children experiences maladaptive behavioral changes after outpatient surgery (1). In one investigation, children who were premedicated with oral midazolam had a significantly decreased incidence of negative behavioral changes during the first week after surgery (43). However, this study noted that by 2 wk postoperatively there were no significant differences between the midazolam and placebo groups. The mechanism by which midazolam decreases the incidence of postoperative behavioral changes is not clear but it may be related to amnesia of the perioperative process (44). Children who received a benzodiazepine for dental extractions and were amnestic about the experience tolerated further dental treatments better than children who were not amnestic about their initial dental extractions (45). This finding may be particularly important for children undergoing repeated surgical procedures. Memory becomes impaired in children after oral midazolam as early as 10 min and anxiolytic effects are apparent as early as 15 min after administration (44). This short timing to onset of amnesia is of particular importance in busy surgery centers where the turnover of cases is very quick. Midazolam and diazepam can be reversed with flumazenil, which antagonizes benzodiazepines competitively. The initial recommended dose in children is 0.05 mg/kg given IV in a titrated fashion of up to 1.0 mg total. Some children who are reversed with flumazenil will experience resedation, so it is prudent to monitor them for 1–2 h (46). Adequate drug levels can also be reached intranasally in a dose of 40 μg/kg given by drops from a syringe (47). Fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is very lipophilic, which makes the drug a good candidate for administration across mucosal and dermal barriers. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) administered in the form of a lozenge attached to a stick and known as the OTFC was the first sedative drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1993 for use in children. Oral transmucosal citrate in 200-, 300-, and 400-μg dosage units is mixed in a raspberry-flavored candy matrix and given to children in the dosage of 10–15 μg/kg for absorption transmucosally. Its sedative effect is often associated with facial pruritus, which usually occurs 30–45 min after children begin to consume the lozenge. OTFC sedates children before induction of anesthesia (48–51). OTFC does not, however, reliably lead to decreased apprehension or improved cooperation with induction in young children (48–51). In a small percentage of patients, OTFC can cause a respiratory depression leading to clinically significant oxygen desaturation, so a clinician skilled in airway management must be present while this drug is administered (48). OTFC usage in children is associated with a frequent incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting that is not easily antagonized by prophylactic droperidol (49). In fact, at least one study was prematurely terminated because of a very frequent incidence of preoperative vomiting (48). A significant advantage of OTFC is that it decreases the postoperative narcotic requirement (50). Dsida et al. (50) reported that preoperative OTFC is as effective as IV fentanyl (2 μg/kg) given intraoperatively for management of postoperative analgesia in children undergoing tonsillectomy. Ketamine. Ketamine is an arylcycloalkylamine that produces a state of sedation, immobility, analgesia, amnesia, and dissociation from the environment. An advantage of ketamine compared with other premedicants is that it causes less respiratory depression when given in equipotent sedative doses (52). A disadvantage of ketamine as compared with other premedicants is the association of increased salivary and bronchial secretions, which can lead to laryngospasm (53). Ketamine can also cause muscle rigidity and nystagmus in children, which can alarm parents if they are not informed about this characteristic. An increased incidence of postoperative emesis is associated with preoperative administration of ketamine (54, 55). The above side effects are all dose related and can be diminished with the use of a small dose of orally administered ketamine (3 mg/kg) (54). Unfortunately, the time of onset of the action of orally administered ketamine is also dose related with large-dose orally administered ketamine (6 mg/kg) having an onset of action of 10 min and small-dose ketamine leading to sedation within 20 min (54,55). Ketamine administration may be associated with agitation and hallucinations during the postoperative period (55,56). Two recent studies have found that concurrent use of a benzodiazepine given to children undergoing ketamine sedation did not affect the incidence of postprocedure agitation (55,56). In addition, the incidence of postoperative nightmares, restless sleep, and nocturia is no different in children receiving ketamine, midazolam, or a combination of ketamine and midazolam together (55). The IV preparation of ketamine can be mixed with cola or fruit syrup to create an oral mixture of ketamine, which is favorably accepted by most children. Ketamine can be also be given intranasally (3–5 mg/kg), transmucosally (5–6 mg/kg), rectally (5 mg/kg), and IM (2–5 mg/kg) (57,58). Postanesthesia care unit discharge time of children who received orally administered ketamine is reported not to be prolonged compared with orally administered midazolam provided that duration of surgery is longer than 30 min (55). Ketamine administered IM in an emergency room setting, however, was found to significantly delay discharge and increase costs compared with midazolam administered rectally or intranasally (59). Funk et al. (55) reported that the combination of midazolam and ketamine administrated orally had a 90% success rate of satisfactory anxiolysis compared with <75% with either drug alone. An oral ketamine/midazolam mixture was also found to be superior to IM meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine in children undergoing pediatric cardiac catheterization (60). The ketamine/midazolam mixture provided superior sedation and amnesia and there was less need for IV propofol rescue as compared with the IM regimen (60). Clonidine. Clonidine is an α2 adrenergic agonist first developed as an antihypertensive agent but later found to have analgesic, anxiolytic, and sedative properties (61). Orally administrated clonidine in a dose of 4 μg/kg reliably causes sedation, decreases anesthetic requirements, and decreases requirement for postoperative analgesics (61–63). End-tidal halothane requirements decrease by almost 50% in children premedicated preoperatively with clonidine (62). This decrease in minimum alveolar concentration requirement may be secondary to the analgesic effect of clonidine as well as a primary hemodynamic effect (62). Preoperatively administered clonidine is also as effective as intraoperatively administered fentanyl (3 μg/kg) for postoperative analgesia in children undergoing tonsillectomies (64). The recovery profile of children who receive clonidine is similar to the recovery profile of children who receive oral diazepam (0.2 mg/kg), but clonidine causes significantly less postoperative psychomotor impairments as compared with diazepam (65,66). One major drawback for the use of clonidine as a sedative premedicant is its slow onset of action. Clonidine has to be administered orally as early as 45 min before surgery (61). In children, peak plasma concentration is at 60–90 min for orally administered clonidine and 50 min for rectally administered clonidine (61). New Directions for the Future Future research efforts should concentrate on the development of sedatives that will be well tolerated, have a very short time for onset of anxiolysis, and have short duration of action. In addition, newly developed preoperative sedatives should possess properties such as antegrade amnesia and should ideally decrease intraoperative anesthetic requirements and reduce postoperative analgesic requirements. Finally, new methods of delivering sedative premedications should also be developed. For example, transdermal applications of medications should be investigated as well as oral transmucosal delivery methods for medications other than fentanyl. Simple transdermal medications usually take at least 1 h for minimally effective serum concentrations of drugs to be reached unless iontophoresis is used. Iontophoresis can significantly speed the transfer of medication across a dermal surface and has been effective in delivering fentanyl in adults within 10 min at 2 mA (67). Finally, the effectiveness of alternative treatment modalities such as acupuncture should be investigated (68). Further research is needed in these areas. The authors would like to thank Paul G.

      "abstract": "Psychoactive agents have been in use for the treatment of psychotic children since the 1930s. In those early years only hypnotics and anticonvulsants were available and they were administered chiefly for the management of excitement and agitation. The discovery of chlorpromazine (Delay & Deniker, 1952) and other neuroleptics resulted in a revolution in the treatment of psychoses of adults. It was hoped that these drugs would arrest or decrease the psychotic process in the child and that after the reduction of anxiety, hyperactivity, and/or aggressiveness he would become more amenable to special education and other treatment modalities. These hopes were not always fulfilled. Drug therapy has come under attack because of improper use, especially with institutionalized retarded Children. This abuse has included high dosage over prolonged periods of time, multiple drug usage—children receiving from two to eight drugs at the same time—no drug holidays, little or no evidence of drug monitoring, and usage of sedative types of phenothiazines which probably suppress cognitive learning functions (Lipman, 1970).",

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "title": "Aberrant Hippocampal Neuroregenerative Plasticity in Schizophrenia: Reactive Neuroblastosis as a Possible Pathocellular Mechanism of Hallucination",
      "abstract": "Hallucination is a sensory perception that occurs in the absence of external stimuli during abnormal neurological disturbances and various mental diseases. Hallucination is recognized as a core psychotic symptom and is particularly more prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia. Strikingly, a significant number of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other neurological diseases like cerebral stroke and epileptic seizure also experience hallucination. While aberrant neurotransmission has been linked to the neuropathogenic events of schizophrenia, the precise cellular mechanism accounting for hallucinations remains obscure. Neurogenesis is a cellular process of producing new neurons from the neural stem cells (NSC)-derived neuroblasts in the brain that contribute to the regulation of pattern separation, mood, olfaction, learning, and memory in adulthood. Impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the adult brain has been linked to stress, anxiety, depression, and dementia. Notably, many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the mitotic and functional activation of neuroblasts and cell cycle re-entry of mature neurons leading to a drastic alteration in neurogenic process, known as reactive neuroblastosis. Considering their neurophysiological properties, the abnormal integration of neuroblasts into the existing neural network or withdrawal of their connections can lead to abnormal synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission. Eventually, this would be expected to result in altered perception accounting for hallucination. Thus, this article emphasizes a hypothesis that aberrant neurogenic processes at the level of reactive neuroblastosis could be an underlying mechanism of hallucination in schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.",

The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

The primary objective of our study was to examine the therapeutic options, guidelines, and clinical considerations for the management of BPSD. The existing literature about BPSD was reviewed with searches in PubMed, MEDLINE, and online search platforms. Dysregulation of neurotransmission involving acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin has been shown to cause behavioral and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. BPSD can include hallucinations, agitation, delusions, anxiety, apathy, abnormal body movements, irritability, depression, disinhibition, and sleep or appetite changes. Pharmacologic therapies used in the treatment of BPSD include antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants. Treatment can be tailored to the specific noncognitive symptoms that are experienced. The use of these agents may be limited based on recommendations from the Beers Criteria®, STOPP criteria, treatment guidelines, and FDA warnings.",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar Affect: When Patients Laugh or Cry, but Don't Know Why",
      "abstract": "[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Disruption of neural circuitry undermines voluntary control of affect Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a disorder of affective expression that manifests as stereotyped and frequent outbursts of crying (not limited to lacrimation) or laughter. Symptoms are involuntary, uncontrolled, and exaggerated or incongruent with current mood. Episodes, lasting a few seconds to several minutes, may be unprovoked or occur in response to a mild stimulus, and patients typically display a normal affect between episodes. (1) PBA is estimated to affect 1 to 2 million people in the United States, although some studies suggest as many as 7 million, (1,2) depending on the evaluation method and threshold criteria used. (3) Many terms have been used to describe aspects of PBA (Table 1 (4) and Box, page 58 (5-10)). This abundance of often conflicting terminology is thought to have impeded efforts to categorize emotional expression disorders, determine their prevalence, and evaluate clinical evidence of potential therapeutic options. (11) Where to look for pseudobulbar affect PBA has been most commonly described in major neurologic disorders: * Alzheimer's disease * amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) * multiple sclerosis (MS) * Parkinson's disease * stroke * traumatic brain injury (TBI). Of these disorders, most studies have found the highest PBA prevalence in patients with ALS and TBI, with lesser (although significant) prevalence in Parkinson's disease (Table 2, page 59). (1,12) These big 6 diagnoses are not a comprehensive list, as many other disease states are associated with PBA (Table 3, page 59). (12-14) As PBA has become better defined and more widely recognized, additional sequelae have been described. PBA's sporadic and unpredictable nature and the potential embarrassment and distress of public outbursts may lead to an agoraphobia-like response. (15) People with PBA report a significantly worse subjective assessment of general health, quality of life, relationships, and work productivity compared with people with similar primary underlying diagnoses without PBA. (16) 2 Pathways: 'Generator' and 'governor' Despite the many and varied injuries and illnesses associated with PBA, Lauterbach et al (10) noted patterns that suggest dysregulation of 2 distinct but interconnected brain pathways: an emotional pathway controlled by a separate volitional pathway. Lesions to the volitional pathway (or its associated feedback or processing circuits) are thought to cause PBA symptoms. To borrow an analogy from engineering, the emotional pathway is the generator of affect, whereas the volitional pathway is the governor of affect. Thus, injury to the governor results in overspill, or overflow, of affect that usually would be suppressed. The emotional pathway, which coordinates the motor aspect of reflex laughing or crying, originates at the frontotemporal cortex, relaying to the amygdala and hypothalamus, then projecting to the dorsal brainstem, which includes the midbrain-pontine periaqueductal gray (PAG), dorsal tegmentum, and related brainstem. The volitional pathway, which regulates the emotional pathway, originates in the dorsal and lateral frontoparietal cortex, projects through the internal capsule and midbrain basis pedunculi, and continues on to the anteroventral basis pontis. The basis ponds then serves as an afferent relay center for cerebellar activity. Projections from the pons then regulate the emotional circuitry primarily at the level of the PAG. (10) Lesions of the volitional pathway have been correlated with conditions of PBA, whereas direct activation of the emotional pathway tended to lead to emotional lability or the crying and laughing behaviors observed in dacrystic or gelastic epilepsy. (10) The pivotal nature of the regulation occurring at the PAG has guided treatment options. …",

      "abstract": "The term addiction commonly used for drug addiction is uncontrolled use of alcohol, nicotine, opiates, heroine and other psychoactive substances. Apart from this some times it is also used for other compulsions. These unwholesome substances or bad habits are the remote causes for several others diseases. These bad habits are harmful for health but sudden discontinuation of these again produces some discomforts or diseases. These are known as withdrawal symptoms like cravings, irritability, insomnia, depression and anorexia, etc. Instead of withdrawal therapy, Ayurveda mentioned an attractive, logical, replacement therapy. It means unwholesome substances or bad habits should be replaced by good one, which is more constructive. The replacement therapy which should be very systematical and gradual is known as Satmyikarana process in Ayurveda. Satmya means suitability to some things, which are favourable for one’s own self. Satmyam nama yad yadatmanyupaseta (CS Vi-1/20). On the other hand, the substance that is unfavorable for one’s own self is known as Asatmya. Asatmyamiti tadvidyadyanna yati sahatmyatam (CS Sa-1/127). Satmya and Asatmya are also known as Upashaya and Anupashaya, respectively. Hita and pathya are frequently used as synonyms for Satmya and their antonym for Asatmya. Satmyikarana is a procedure of adaptation by gradual and logical giving up of Asatmya substance, on the other hand layer by layer acceptance of Satmya substance. In another word, making foreign substance homologous to body is also known as Satmyikarana. When persons are habituated to any unwholesome substances they feel happy with that. Absence of it creates emptiness or discomfort. Instead of being left blank, filling the blanks with another good one is more constructive. Administration of wholesome substances in this specific way may helps to avoid addictive stimulus and exhibit a healthier way to quench the thirst. It resists the appearance of withdrawal symptoms.",

To avoid discontinuation of medication, recurrence of psychosis, and rehospitalization, a longer acting psychotropic compound was needed, similar to depot insulin used in diabetes, and the development of such a compound among the phenothiazines was encouraged.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The various forms of behavior that constitute the label “challenging behavior” are not diagnostic categories, although they are sometimes treated as such particularly by the medical profession when using psychotropics. These behaviors are usually elicited by residents when they are distressed, confused, disinhibited, misinterpreting situations, deluded, or hallucinating. The behaviors are often transient, but need to be dealt with when they place the resident or others at risk of physical, emotional, or psychological harm. Often the causes are multifactorial, although some can be directly linked to physical problems (delirium, infection, and pain). Owing to the complex nature of many of these behaviors, a comprehensive assessment of the potential causes should be undertaken. This should be done prior to the administration of medication. Once the causes have been identified, individualized approaches aimed at reducing the relevant distress (e.g. improved communication, use of aromatherapy, music, etc.) or confusion (use of memory aids, signage, environmental changes) have been shown to be helpful. However, such strategies need to take account of the needs of the individual with dementia, the staff, and the resources within the care setting. The present case illustrates an approach used by a clinical team that fulfills the above requirements, and the processes by which successful outcomes can be achieved have been illustrated.",

      "abstract": "The term \"acute psychosis\" is commonly used as a provisional diagnosis in psychiatric acute settings, especially in emergency, when there is not sufficient information available to give a specific categorical diagnosis. The provisional diagnosis \"acute psychosis\" involves psychotic conditions with acute onset, psychotic conditions with unknown course and acute behavioural disorders with unknown subjective experiences. Because this provisional diagnosis is not a proper category, dimensional assessment of psychopathology including delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, mood/affect, catatonia and disorder of consciousness is required to start specific treatment. As \"acute psychosis\" is nosologically ill defined in the dichotomy of schizophrenia and mood disorder, traditional types such as bouffée délirante, cycloid psychoses and reactive psychosis are useful in practice as frames of reference. Because the provisional diagnosis of \"acute psychosis\" involves non-psychotic disorders such as adjustment disorders and personality disorders, the perspective of genetic understanding is helpful in making a non-dimensional differential diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Dangerous practices and games at school. Three separate categories of dangerous games can be distinguished. The non-oxygenating or fainting games, which consist of mechanical compressions or strangulative mechanisms. These are performed in the search of pseudo-hallucinogenic sensations. There are several such games: from the simple but non-the-less dangerous \"tomato game\", performed by younger children (from 3-4 years of age), to the \"choking game\", between 7 and 14 years of age. \"Aggressive\" or \"violent\" games which use physical and psychological violence from a group of people towards a single individual. Acute neurological complications can be the consequence of such games, and their degree depends on the duration and intensity of the strangulation. These can vary from cerebral edema, loss of consciousness, long term cerebral damage (deafness, blindness, bedridden), irreversible coma and death. Physical consequences of aggressive games are equally important, such as vertebral fractures, cranial trauma, organ rupture. Victims of violence present repeated psycho-traumatic manifestations. Preventive messages associate information on the risks of such games with civic education (listening, solidarity and trust in others), the development of psychological and social skills, an active involvement in school-life and concrete responsibility taking. Early identification of symptoms of these practices by family members and professionals helps to avoid their repetition and increased danger, even addictive patterns.Pratiques et jeux dangereux en milieu scolaire. Les pratiques dangereuses en cour d’école sont multiples. Les jeux dits de non-oxygénation ou d’évanouissement consistent, par un mécanisme de compression ou de strangulation, à rechercher certaines sensations pseudo-hallucinatoires. Les jeux dits d’agression ou jeux violents utilisent la violence physique ou psychologique de manière gratuite d’un groupe de jeunes envers une personne seule. Leur caractère répétitif dans le temps définit le harcèlement. La durée et l’intensité de la strangulation peuvent induire des complications neurologiques aiguës (oedème cérébral, perte de connaissance prolongée), des lésions cérébrales définitives (surdité, cécité, état grabataire), un coma irréversible, le décès. Les conséquences physiques des jeux d’agression sont très lourdes : fractures de la colonne vertébrale, traumatismes crâniens, ruptures d’organes. Les enfants victimes ont des manifestations psychotraumatiques répétées. Les messages de prévention associent, outre une information sur les risques, une éducation à la citoyenneté (écoute, cohésion, solidarité, confiance en l’autre), le développement de compétences psychologiques et sociales de l’enfant, une implication active du jeune dans la vie scolaire et la prise de responsabilités concrètes. Le repérage par les familles et les professionnels de symptômes chroniques évocateurs de ces pratiques permet d’éviter leur répétition et leur dangerosité encore accrue, voire un passage à l’addiction.",

      "abstract": "What is the topic of this review? It provides an overview of the recent papers linking brain neurotransmission with exercise-induced and/or mental fatigue. What advances does it highlight? The noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue during prolonged exercise, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. 2) Mental fatigue affects several neurotransmitter systems, with presumably an important role for dopamine and adenosine, in multiple brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex.In sports and exercise science, fatigue is an elusive concept that has important implications in performance during exercise. It has been described in many ways (tiredness, exhaustion, lethargy or weariness) and describes a physical and/or mental state of being tired and lack of energy. Exercise-induced fatigue can be defined as an acute impairment of exercise performance, and a distinction has been made between peripheral and central fatigue. Mental fatigue can be defined as a psychobiological state caused by prolonged exertion that has the potential to reduce cognitive performance and exercise performance. Recent studies have given clear indications that brain catecholamines are involved in the onset of fatigue during endurance exercise. Evidence is provided indicating that the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. Brain neurotransmission is also suggested to play an important role in mental fatigue. Several neurotransmitter systems might be implicated (with the most important role for dopamine and adenosine) in multiple brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and the summation of these alterations might explain the impairment in endurance performance in a mentally fatigued state. Obviously, we have to keep in mind that fatigue is a very complex construct and that, besides brain neurochemistry, several other factors play a role in its onset.",

Both trauma and long-term stress can cause alterations in the activities of neuroanatomical structures and neural networks within the central nervous system. These neurohormonal changes are associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a disturbance thought to be one of the most serious psychiatric illnesses. PTSD may develop in individuals after exposure to a traumatic event (war, violence, accident) and is manifested by various symptoms, such as re-experiencing, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, impaired memory of the event, sleep disorders, nightmares, panic attacks, and depression.

      "title": "Postpartum Delirium: A Psychosis Born in the 18th Century",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy and childbirth are moments of great vulnerability in a woman’s life, which can predispose her to the development of psychopathology, ranging from transient depressive symptoms (“baby blues”) to psychotic symptoms. Postpartum delirium is the psychiatric syndrome that some authors refer to as puerperal psychosis par excellence. It was first described in the 18th century and were thought to be associated with painful delivery, then became rare after the introduction of effective analgesia. Objectives The objective of this work is to contribute to a better understanding of this condition, through a literature review. Methods Bibliographic research using Pubmed® and the keywords: postpartum delirium. Results Clinical presentation of postpartum delirium includes: constantly varying degrees of consciousness; perplexity; hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations of one or more organs of sense; delusions or delusive-type thoughts; great motoric unrest and considerable motoric and verbal abandon; and acute aggressive discharges can also occur. It is thought to be due to organic complications, such as infectious disease, abnormal loss of blood, thrombosis, neurological disease, obstetric disease, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes. An article from 1975 mentions how difficult was to treat postpartum delirium despite the development of psychopharmaceutical therapy. The patients remained psychotic for long periods and had many relapses. They mention a comparative study that found that the symptomatic treatment of this syndrome with a combination of perfenazine and lithium carbonate produced relatively favorable results. For that reason, at that time, it was the medication of choice. Nowadays the psychopharmacological treatment of puerperal psychosis, in general, still consists of the combination of lithium and an antipsychotic, such as haloperidol, and possibly a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. Conclusions Postpartum delirium is rarely mentioned in the literature and just a few cases have been described. It is considered a rare postpartum psychotic condition but would perhaps be less rare if its existence were recognized. On this note, it is important for clinical practice to research on the psychoses of pregnancy and not just the most common. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Lapses in psychic functioning, i.e., occurrence of certain psychological mishaps, e.g., making a slip of tongue, reading wrong word, stumbling in walking, forgetting to carry out an intended purpose, accidentally breaking or mislaying something, failing to recall what one ought to be able to recall, etc., have been attracting a great deal of attention during past fifteen or twenty years. Unfortunately for psychology, those who gave subject this attention approached it with a bias resulting from preoccupation with system of psychotherapeutics known as psycho-analysis. Owing to this bias these investigators found in these lapses confirmation of their theories about mental and they have used these lapses and their interpretations of them as a means of introducing uninitiated into mysteries of so-called new psychology. According to this new such lapses are not explainable by principles of orthodox psychology, are due to operation of mental processes of which individual is not and cannot be aware at time of lapse, are manifestation of activity within the of desires of a painful or disgusting or unthinkable nature, and betray something which individual does not want to know or have known about himself. In following analyses of such lapses (slips of tongue, etc.) as have recently come under my notice or have been studied by me, I shall show that such psychic mishaps or accidents can be satisfactorily explained by principles of orthodox psychology, do not involve unknown or unknowable mental processes, are not manifestations of repressed desires, are not unconscious betrayals of individual's secret self, and that they furnish not slightest basis on which to construct a psychology of unconscious. The careful scrutiny of circumstances surrounding lapses (slips, forgettings, accidental breakages, etc.) proves that these mistakes are results of verifiable psychophysiological processes, that known laws of orthodox psychology are adequate to explain them, that they are psychologically determined (not psychically determined), that they are not valid psychic acts and do not give expression to repressed, unknown, and unknowable motives of an undesirable, discreditable, or disgusting nature.

      "abstract": "Los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) son trastornos multideterminados en los que los niveles biologico, psicologico y social influyen decididamente en su aparicion y mantenimiento. A nivel biologico las alteraciones que se producen en el organismo debido a la malnutricion y las conductas purgativas deben ser tenidas en cuenta para no confundir las manifestaciones psicologicas debidas a alteraciones somaticas con trastornos de la personalidad, ni con interacciones familiares disfuncionales. Por otro lado el abordaje puramente somatico es necesario, ya sea normalizando las constantes vitales, recetando farmacos psicotropos, o regulando una dieta adecuada. A nivel psicologico las alteraciones de la personalidad previa, una deficiente autoimagen y baja autoestima que se asientan sobre una base depresiva, se ven incrementadas por las conductas alimentarias disfuncionales. Estas alteraciones psicologicas deben ser estudiadas en detalle para incluirlas como objetivo terapeutico (Espina, 2003). A nivel social, la moda de la delgadez y el exito en la sociedad occidental, hace que personas susceptibles sean mas vulnerables a padecer trastornos alimentarios. Por otro lado, las relaciones familiares pueden tener unas caracteristicas, especialmente la dificultad de autonomizacion de sus miembros y las alteraciones de la comunicacion, que son terreno abonado para la aparicion de trastornos alimentarios en personas susceptibles. Estos factores, junto con acontecimientos vitales estresantes (separaciones, perdidas, fracasos...), pueden jugar un papel etiologico y, cuando el TCA esta establecido, actuar como factores de mantenimiento (Espina, 1998a).",

      "abstract": "Neuropati Optik Toksik (NOT) adalah kelainan pada fungsi penglihatan akibat kerusakan saraf optik yang disebabkan oleh zat beracun salah satunya adalah etambutol. Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotics are the second most commonly prescribed class of medication in the United States. An awareness and understanding of their potential effects on the central nervous system and their interactions with psychotropic agents is important in the evaluation of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms in patients. Since the introduction of antibiotic agents in the 1930s, numerous (primarily anecdotal) reports have appeared describing psychiatric side effects ranging from anxiety and panic to major depression, psychosis, and delirium in patients with and without a premorbid psychiatric history. Risk factors have included prior psychopathology, coexisting medical conditions, slow acetylator status, advanced age, concomitant medications, and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, as well as high antibiotic dosage and intrathecal or intravenous administration. Psychiatric toxicity may result from various mechanisms of action, including antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid or pyridoxine, adverse interactions with alcohol, or inhibition of protein synthesis. Adverse pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between antibiotics and concomitant medications including lithium, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, valproate, neuroleptics, antidepressants, methadone, and disulfiram have also been reported. Because such effects are often not recognized by clinicians, accurate epidemiologic data on their incidence are not available.",

Sargant interpreted these reactions in terms of a physiology derived from Pavlov, particular emphasis being laid on “transmarginal inhibition“—a variety of the “internal inhibition”, or “hypnosis” which Pavlov identified with sleep, and which was manifested by motor inertia and unresponsiveness to stimuli. Pavlov's dogs exhibited internal inhibition in response to monotonous stimulation of any kind (including repeated electric shocks); repeated non-reinforcement, disappointment, or non-fulfilment of the dog's expectations; delay in reinforcement; and, in experienced dogs, in response to being placed in the experimental situation (or having the stimulating electrode attached to the leg in the case of those given electric shocks).",

This approach ignores the brain states or feedback from the central nervous system or peripheral recordings, thus potentially limiting its efficacy and inducing side effects by stimulation of the targeted networks below or above the therapeutic level. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The currently emerging closed-loop (CL) approaches are designed to adapt stimulation parameters to the electrophysiological surrogates of disease symptoms and states. CL-DBS paves the way for adaptive personalized DBS protocols. This review elaborates on the perspectives of the CL technology and discusses its opportunities as well as its potential pitfalls for both clinical and research use in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "The gustatory system is responsible for four basic taste experiences: salty, sweet, sour, and bitter. A fifth quality, called umami, has been postulated to describe the taste of monosodium glutamate and related compounds (Rolls et al., 1998). However, these taste bud-mediated sensations should not be confused with flavor sensations like coffee, chocolate, strawberry, lemon, steak sauce, barbeque sauce, etc., which are mediated via the olfactory system. During deglutition, volatiles from foodstuffs or drinks stimulate the olfactory receptors retronasally (i.e., through the nasopharynx), imparting such sensations. Additional components of flavor include texture, temperature, oral irritation, pungentness, and other somatosensory sensations. Although many of these interrelated components of flavor can be impaired or distorted following traumatic cranial nerve or brain injury, nasal or oral trauma, and surgical or medical therapies, such impairment is extremely rare. In general, most \"taste\" losses reflect damage to the olfactory system (see Chapters 22, 30, and 44).",

Cognitive-behavior therapy of insomnia is multicomponent treatment with some nonspecific components (like hygiene of sleeping) and some specific components directed to dysfunctional behavior and way of thinking, like sleep education, stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation training, and cognitive therapy. The advantage of this therapy vs. pharmacotherapy of insomnia is that there are no problems of addiction, tolerance, side effects etc. The results of clinical trials suggest that the cognitive- behavior therapy leads to better quality of sleeping of most people with problem of insomnia, but insufficient number of educated cognitive-behavior therapists limits the much wider use of cognitive-behavior therapy in the treatment of insomnia.",

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

      "abstract": "1. If mild cerebral trauma such as we were investigating produced changes in the electroencephalographic tracing the abnormality disappeared within a period of minutes in the vast majority of cases. 2. Patients who gave a history of amnesia following cerebral trauma, but were clear mentally at the time the EEG was taken, showed only a slight increase in the percentage of abnormal records as compared to the control series. This was true even when the records were taken within a few hours of the accident. 3. If there was an impairment of consciousness of any degree at the time the EEG was taken, abnormality in the EEG was the rule. 4. Electroencephalographic records taken within 30 minutes after patients sustained head injury showed a greater percentage of abnormality than those taken after 30 minutes had elapsed. The rapid disappearance of abnormal electroencephalographic findings points, in our opinion, to some mechanism in concussion other than petechial hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, embolic phenomenon, or any other histopathological change which must of necessity require several days to disappear. 5. In the patients with abnormal electroencephalographic records the average velocity of the striking object or of the falling head at the time of impact was greater than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals as determined by others. The average velocity of the striking object or falling head in patients who showed normal or borderline electroencephalographic records was less than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals. 6. The study of the electroencephalographic records taken immediately following mild head injury was less reliable than clinical judgment in predicting time loss from work. An ultimate opinion of the value of EEGs in this respect will depend upon a study of a group of more severely injured patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is considerable interest in the role of neuroimmune processes in neuropsychiatric presentations among young people seeking mental health, neurological, paediatric and rheumatological services. The increasing availability of new immunotherapies, particularly monoclonal antibodies, introduces challenges in effectively and appropriately selecting candidates for immunotherapies. Neuroimmune-mediated neuropsychiatric syndromes (NIMNPS) typically include two broad types: i) ‘autoimmune encephalitis’, characterised by acute or subacute onset, neurological signs such as seizures, delirium or motor features and severe psychotic or major mood phenomena. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis was a pioneering clinical example, but various other autoantibodies have since been associated with this phenotype; and ii) atypical mood or psychotic syndromes with sub-acute or insidious onset, moderately severe atypical mood or psychotic symptoms, autonomic dysregulation, narcolepsy-like features, poor response to conventional treatments and adverse (notably motor) effects from psychotropic medications. Diagnosis of NIMNPS requires clinical or laboratory evidence of direct brain involvement, though autoantibodies are not always detectable. Given the broad and controversial diagnostic criteria for NIMNPS, we propose standardised clinical criteria for identifying ‘possible cases’, followed by laboratory, neuropsychological and brain imaging tests to confirm ‘probable’ cases suitable for immunotherapy. We emphasise rapid clinical and informed co-decision-making with young people and their families and loved ones. While immunotherapy holds promise for symptom alleviation, highly-personalised approaches and long-term management are essential. Future research should validate our proposed criteria, establish optimal, standardised yet personalised immunotherapy strategies that balance between clinical benefit and risks, and identify predictive markers of treatment response.",

For conceptual clarity, it is helpful to consider that there are different ways in which emotional factors can exert an influence on the course of any illness. Several of these factors are briefly described as follows: 1. Occasionally the emotional state or set of attitudes of the patient may be reflected in his inability or unwillingness to cooperate with the therapeutic regimen prescribed for him. This difficulty may be encountered, of course, in every degree of severity ranging from mildly annoying uncooperativeness to defiance of medical advice with tragic consequences.

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

Neurological complications increase the length of ICU and hospital stay, and reduce the likelihood of return to independent living. Minor neurological complications are very common and often go undiagnosed. It is now recognized that transient and early postoperative problems such as confusion, agitation, and delirium – previously considered self-limiting nuisances – are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a decline in cognitive function in the early postoperative period is predictive of late (five-year) cognitive decline. General considerations Clinical spectrum The spectrum of central nervous system injury during and after cardiac surgery encompasses a wide range of clinical entities ranging from death or persistent vegetative state to subtle changes in memory and concentration: Neurological injury may be: immediate – apparent soon after the patient recovers from anaesthesia; or delayed – with onset after a...",

Therefore, for cases in which verbal de-escalation fails, physical restraint and sedation may be required to ensure a safe environment where further acute care diagnosis and treatment can proceed., Treatment goals for this indication are rapid and safe sedation.Droperidol is a butyrophenone used in acute care settings for a variety of purposes, including the rapid sedation of patients with agitation, aggression, or who are exhibiting violent behaviour., Droperidol can be administered intravenously and it can also be administered intramuscularly, which has practical advantages when safely dealing with agitated patients. Many antipsychotic drugs, including droperidol, haloperidol, and olanzapine, have a similar adverse event profile that includes serious events such as respiratory depression, cardiac events, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).In 2001, a black box warning was issued by the US FDA for the use of droperidol based on post-marketing surveillance data., The black box warning emphasized careful patient selection and increased monitoring to prevent corrected QT (QTc) interval elongation in patients administered droperidol. QTc elongation can lead to sudden cardiac death. The extra burden placed on management of patients with droperidol has greatly decreased its use and availability in the US.The purpose of this report was to retrieve and review the current evidence on the safety and efficacy of droperidol for patients with agitation, aggression, or violent behaviour in acute care settings. In addition, this report aimed to retrieve and review relevant evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of droperidol in acute care settings.",

Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

      "title": "The impact of antipsychotic side effects on attitudes toward medication in patients with schizophrenia: A systematic review",
      "abstract": "Background Schizophrenia is a serious, debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by positive symptoms (namely hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (such as alogia, avolition, anhedonia, apathy and asociality), and disorganized symptoms (like disorganized speech and behaviour)1. Antipsychotics have become the mainstay treatment2,3 for symptomatic relief in both acute and chronic phases of schizophrenia,4,5 and the maintenance of antipsychotic treatment has been shown to play a vital role in relapse prevention.6,7 However, antipsychotics have long been associated with a wide range of side effects,6,8 including anticholinergic, extrapyramidal, hormonal, cardiovascular and haematological reactions, and these potentially have an adverse effect on patients' biological, psychological, sexual and social functioning.3,8 Clinicians have frequently observed that some patients experience a changed subjective state barely after a few doses from the initiation of antipsychotic treatment.9 This has been commonly described by patients as feeling ‘apathetic', ‘mummified', ‘like zombies', and ‘being incapable of thinking'.4 The development of undesirable side effects has shown to have many debilitating consequences, such as emotional distress, reduced quality of life, poorer interpersonal relationships, and reduced ability to undertake employment or fulfill work requirements.3 Overall, many patients experience antipsychotics as unpleasant and something they would rather avoid.2 As a result, medication noncompliance has become a major problem in antipsychotic treatment.10,11 This has led to higher rates of relapse5 and more frequent episodes of rehospitalisation.12 The subsequent clinical course is usually poor,13 with the exacerbations of symptoms eventually leading to the development of chronic psychosis.14 Generally, it has become a challenge for patients to return to their pre-relapse level of social adjustment, fulfill social and familial roles, secure employment or reintegrate back into the society.15 As such, medication compliance has become a focus of increasing concern for patients with schizophrenia,2 However, there is a lack of an adequate methodology to directly assess medication compliance. Instead, some clinicians attempted to use other indirect but relatively more convenient methods of assessing medication compliance, and this has been done through examining a multitude of factors that appear to influence medication compliance. Among these, side effects and negative attitudes toward antipsychotics have emerged to be among the major predictors of medication noncompliance.2,3,16,17 The importance of evaluating the patients' perspective, especially their attitudes toward medication in the presence of side effects, has long been emphasised.2,9,11,18 Hence, not only is it important to assess antipsychotic side effects independently, it is also essential to assess patients' attitudes toward antipsychotics in relation to their experience of side effects.4 However, no definite conclusion has been made thus far on the relationship between antipsychotic side effects and attitudes toward medication, as studies had conflicting results. There are studies that have found a positive relationship between antipsychotic side effects and negative attitudes toward medication,4 with some of these relating negative attitudes toward medication to only specific individual side effects, such as sedation,1 increased duration of sleep19 and extrapyramidal symptoms.5 However, there are a few studies that suggest a general weak relationship between antipsychotic side effects and negative attitudes toward medication.3,19 This systematic review will therefore examine the impact of antipsychotic side effects on attitudes towards medication in patients with schizophrenia. The results from this review could provide insight on the relationship between antipsychotic side effects with patients' attitudes toward medication. Unlike most of the other factors influencing medication noncompliance (such as demographic variables, psychopathology or insight), attitude is relatively modifiable, and its assessment allows for the potential implementation or intensification of more patient-centred, medication-directed interventions. This potentially increases patients' acceptance of the necessity of pharmacological treatment4, thereby promoting a more positive clinical course, better psychosocial functioning, formation of more stable and satisfactory social and family relationships, fewer symptoms and minimal episodes of rehospitalisation3. Review Objective The objective of this systematic review is to systematically review the best available evidence to determine whether antipsychotic side effects have an impact on attitudes toward medication in patients with schizophrenia. More specifically, the review question is: What is the impact of antipsychotic side effects on attitudes toward medication in patients with schizophrenia? Criteria for Considering Studies for This Review Types of Studies This review will consider quantitative research papers that examine the magnitude of the effect of antipsychotic side effects on attitudes toward medication in patients with schizophrenia and report findings in quantifiable terms (such as effect sizes, correlation coefficients, or regression coefficient. The higest priority will be placed on studies with the highest level of evidence (such as randomised controlled trial and other experimental designs). Non-experimental studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies will also be considered. Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults who have a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia receiving medication treatment (typical or atypical antipsychotics) from any health care settings (inpatient or outpatient). Types of interventions This review will include studies that investigate the impact of antipsychotics side effects using standardised instruments (both self-rated and clinician-rated instruments), such as the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale (LUNSERS) or the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale. Types of outcome measures / anticipated outcomes This review will include studies that quantitatively measure attitudes toward medication using standardised scales, such as the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI). Attitudes toward medication refer to the patients' perception towards different aspects of medication, including, but not limited to medication-taking, medication effects, and/or medication side effects. Exclusion criteria This review will exclude studies that involve: Qualitative data analyses as they do not represent the magnitude of the relationship between independent on dependent variables in measureable terms (e.g. correlation or regression coefficients); Patients aged less than 18 and more than 65 years old; Collecting data without using standardized instruments; and Collecting data using standardized instruments that focus on a single aspect of medication side effects (such as weight gain only). Search Strategy for Identification of Studies Prior to commencing this review, a preliminary search of the Joanna-Briggs Institute (JBI) Library of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted, and no activity of the review topic has been identified. The search strategy aims to find published studies and papers. A three-step search strategy will be utilised in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) was undertaken with the search terms “antipsychotic”, “side effect”, “attitude” and “schizophrenia” used singly or in combination, followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. The identified keywords and index terms are: Antipsychotic*, neuroleptic*; Side effect*, adverse effect*, adverse drug event*, adverse drug reaction*; Attitude*, subjective response*; Schizophren* A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will be undertaken, and it will extend to the following databases: MEDLINE CINAHL PsycINFO Scopus ScienceDirect Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Science Citation Index, Arts & Humanities Citation Index) Search terms will be modified depending on the format used in each database, and the use of database-specific headings will be included where available (e.g. MeSH headings in MEDLINE). The search will be limited to studies in English language and those published between the years 1990 to 2009. The search strategy (Appendix I) will cover search fields limited to title, abstract and keywords. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. All studies identified during these searches will be assessed by two independent reviewers for relevance based on the title and abstract. For studies that meet the inclusion criteria or those with inconclusive titles and abstracts, the full text will be retrieved for further assessment against the inclusion criteria to determine their relevance to the review objective. The decision to consider the study for inclusion in the review will then be undertaken by the two reviewers. All references will be entered into the bibliographic software package Endnote. Methods of Review Assessment of Methodological Quality Studies selected for retrieval will be assessed by the two reviewers for methodological quality prior to inclusion in the review using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Cohort/Case Control appraisal (Appendix II) and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Descriptive/Case series studies (Appendix III). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. Data Extraction Data will be extracted from studies included in the review using the JBI Data Extraction Form for Comparative Cohort/Case Control studies (Appendix IV) and the JBI Data Extraction Form for Descriptive/Case series studies (Appendix V). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. Data Synthesis Where possible, quantitative research study results will be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the JBI Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be double entered. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible, the findings will be presented in narrative form. Conflict of Interest There are no conflicts of interest regarding this systematic review.",

      "title": "Fatigue after Depression Responds to Therapy: What Are the Next Steps? A Sufficient Base of Evidence Is Often Lacking to Guide Pharmacotherapy for Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Fatigue and depression can be viewed as a vicious cycle: Fatigue can be a symptom of major depression, and fatigue can be a risk factor for depression. (1) For example, fatigue associated with a general medical condition or traumatic brain injury can be a risk factor for developing major depressive disorder (MDD). (1-3) It isn't surprising that fatigue has been studied as a predictor of relapse after previous response to treatment in patients with MDD. Despite the observed association between fatigue and depression, their underlying relationship often is unclear. The literature does not differentiate among fatigue associated with depression, fatigue as a treatment-emergent adverse effect, and fatigue as a residual symptom of depression that is partially responsive to treatment. (4,5) To complicate the situation, many medications used to treat MDD can cause fatigue. Patients often describe fatigue as (1) feeling tired, exhausted, or drained and (2) lacking energy and motivation. Fatigue can be related to impaired wakefulness but is believed to be a different entity than sleepiness. (6) Residual fatigue can affect social, cognitive, emotional, and physical health. We reviewed the literature about fatigue as a symptom of MDD by conducting a search of Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, using keywords depression, fatigue, residual symptoms, and treatment. We chose the papers cited in this article based on our consensus and because these publications represent expert opinion or the highest quality evidence available. Residual fatigue has an effect on prognosis Fatigue is a common symptom of MDD that persists in 20% to 30% of patients whose symptoms of depression otherwise remit. (4,7-9) Several studies have linked residual fatigue with the overall prognosis of MDD. (5) Data from a prospective study demonstrate that depressed patients have a higher risk of relapse when they continue to report symptoms of fatigue after their symptoms of depression have otherwise entered partial remission. (10) Another study demonstrated that the severity of residual symptoms of depression is a strong predictor of another major depressive episode. (11) In a large-scale study the prevalence of residual fatigue after adequate treatment of MDD in both partial responders and remitters was 84.6%. (12) The same study showed that one-third of patients who had been treated for MDD had persistent and clinically significant fatigue, which could suggest a relationship between fatigue and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants. Another study demonstrated that 64.6% of patients who responded to antidepressant treatment and who had baseline fatigue continued to exhibit symptoms of fatigue after an adequate trial of an antidepressant. (13) Neurobiological considerations Studies have shown that the neuronal circuits that malfunction in fatigue are different from those that malfunction in depression. (14) Although the neurobiology of fatigue has not been determined, decreased neuronal activity in the prefrontal circuits has been associated with symptoms of fatigue. (15) In addition, evidence from the literature shows a decrease in hormone secretion (16) and cognitive abilities in patients exhibiting symptoms of fatigue. (17) These findings have led some experts to hypothesize that symptoms of fatigue associated with depression could be the result of (1) immune dysregulation (18) and (2) an inability of available antidepressants to target the underlying biology of the disorder. (2) Despite the hypothesis that fatigue associated with depression might be biologically related to immune dysregulation, some authors continue to point to an imbalance in neurotransmitters--norepinephrine, histamine, dopamine, acetylcholine--as being associated with fatigue. (14) For example, a study demonstrated that drugs targeting noradrenergic reuptake inhibition were more effective at preventing a relapse of fatigue compared with serotonergic drugs. …",

      "abstract": "Introducción: el trastorno depresivo mayor es una alteración muy frecuente del estado de ánimo con gran impacto personal y social. Puede generar déficit notables en funciones psicológicas importantes como la ejecutiva, la atención o la memoria y evolucionar hasta un cuadro de pseudodemencia susceptible de mejorar con tratamiento antidepresivo.Objetivo: describir el funcionamiento de la memoria explícita en el trastorno depresivo mayor. Materiales y métodos: se hizo una búsqueda en la base de datos PUBMED con las palabras clave “major depression” (depresión mayor), “explicit memory” (memoria explícita) y “recollection memory” (memoria de recolección); se tomaron los artículos publicados después del año 2000; adicionalmente se incluyó bibliografía científica relevante para el cumplimiento del objetivo. Desarrollo: en la neuroanatomía del trastorno depresivo mayor se encuentran implicadas redes fronto-subcorticales (como las áreas prefrontales, tálamo, ganglios basales, hipocampo, entre otras). Estas estructuras pueden presentar atrofias que explicarían la persistencia o cronicidad de algunos de los síntomas cognitivos de la depresión. Las alteraciones en la memoria explícita, declarativa o de recolección, son de particular importancia por ser las más frecuentemente encontradas en sujetos con uno o más episodios depresivos mayores, y la estructura cerebral que se ha correlacionado más directamente con alteraciones en el almacenamiento de la memoria explícita es el hipocampo. Se ha observado actividad continua de neurogénesis en el hipocampo de animales adultos, la cual es especialmente susceptible cuando hay exposición prolongada a situaciones de estrés grave. Esto se evidencia en estudios que han encontrado reducido su volumen en sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor, en comparación con individuos sanos. De todas maneras, aunque no se encuentre una reducción marcada del volumen, se sugiere que hay una alteración de su funcionamiento.Conclusiones: la memoria explícita es un proceso psicológico con base biológica precisa, cuya estructura y funcionamiento se alteran en presencia de una condición menos precisa como la depresión mayor.",

      "abstract": "<italic>Life’s Rewards: Linking Dopamine, Incentive Learning, Schizophrenia, and the Mind</italic> explains how increased brain dopamine produces reward-related incentive learning, the acquisition by neutral stimuli of increased ability to elicit approach and other responses. Dopamine decreases may produce inverse incentive learning, the loss by stimuli of the ability to elicit approach and other responses. Incentive learning is gradually lost when dopamine receptors are blocked. The brain has multiple memory systems defined as “declarative” and “non-declarative;” incentive learning produces one form of non-declarative memory. People with schizophrenia have hyperdopaminergia, possibly producing excessive incentive learning. Delusions may rely on declarative memory to interpret the world as it appears with excessive incentive learning. Parkinson’s disease, associated with dopamine loss, may involve a loss of incentive learning and increased inverse incentive learning. Drugs of abuse activate dopaminergic neurotransmission, leading to incentive learning about drug-associated stimuli. After withdrawal symptoms have been alleviated by detoxification treatment, drug-associated conditioned incentive stimuli will retain their ability to elicit responses until they are repeatedly experienced in the absence of primary drug rewards. Incentive learning may involve the action of dopamine at dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons that have recently had glutamatergic input from assemblies of cortical neurons activated by environmental and proprioceptive stimuli. Glutamate initiates a wave of phosphorylation normally followed by a wave of phosphatase activity. If dopaminergic neurons fire, stimulation of D1 receptors prolongs the wave of phosphorylation, allowing glutamate synaptic strengthening. Activity in dopaminergic neurons in humans appears to affect mental experience.",

      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Christian Derouesne La troisieme conference internationale sur la demence a corps de Lewy (DCL) [1] reconnait les difficultes du diagnostic liees a la faible sensibilite des criteres utilises. Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

      "abstract": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is the most common type of status epilepticus and carries the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality (1). It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

      "title": "Utilization of Resistance and Paradox Communication in Short-Term Psychotherapy",
      "abstract": "Short-term psychotherapy can be applied most successfully in the treatment of cases which are characterized by great tension, distress and emotional upheaval, accompanied by heightened problem awareness. These cases are mostly acute ones, or represent the flaring up of chronic personality disturbances which have hitherto been compensated. These arise as a consequence of interpersonal conflicts, crisis situations, incapacitating or particularly unpleasant symptoms, object-loss, etc. Increased problem awareness and feeling of helplessness may motivate such patients to seek help more actively; it can make them more prone to develop a close and intense relationship with the therapist. The motivation to psychotherapy can also be elicited and activated by the therapist's appropriate behavior (i.e., by his congruence, empathy, unconditioned positive regard for the patient, etc.). The patient's state of mind and his need for attachment to a person in an asymetric, help-seeking way make the therapeutic interaction more dynamic and more intense. The signs of transference (both positive and negative) appear earler and stronger, and projections, regressive behavior patterns, infantile wishes and expectations come forward and can be recognized. These aspects of the patient's behavior evolve usually in the form of what is called resistance in psychoanalytic therapy, hence, in short-term psychotherapy, special attention must be paid to the various manifestations of resistance. Resistance operates chiefly against the verbalization and working-through of past experiences; it hinders the development of insight, but does not prevent the therapeutic transactions which try to utilize motivational trends, manifested in the patterns of resistance, to help the patient to show and to communicate his problems in an indirect, disguised way to the therapist. This utilization increases the possibility of corrective emotional experience for the patient, and thereby facilitates behavior change. The most appropriate and effective procedure for controlling and utilizing resistance is the paradox communication, in the sense of communicational theory, as developed by Bateson, Jackson and Haley (or the Palo Alto group). Paradox communication – or simply paradox-involves verbal messages as well as nonverbal communication, and im- Bud a plies manipulative tactics on the part of the therapist with the therapeutic relationship; its principle rests on taking into account the adaptive functions of symptomatic behavior, although the adaptation is mostly inadequately accomplished, both within the personality and in the interpersonal field. Paradox communication consists of promoting in the patient some of the motivational tendencies or interactional strategies, which, in the particular case, have consequences that interfere with symptomatic behavior. This leads almost inevitably to change at some level, either in the patients' relationship with the therapist or in his behavior outside the therapist's office. Short-term psychotherapy can be regarded as a process of regulation in a two-person system – in the sense of the systems theory – through a sequence of paradox communications; it is thereby a process bringing about a change (mostly a limited one) in the patient's behavior. The whole process may evolve without the awareness of the patient, and along the lines of resistance. The author elaborates his observations and views about the theory and practical uses of paradox communications, and briefly states his assumptions concerning the limitations in therapeutic goals, and the criteria of the outcome in short-term psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Metabolic encephalopathy is an acute disturbance in cellular metabolism in the brain evoked by conditions of hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, oxidative stress and/or inflammation. It usually develops acutely or subacutely and is reversible if the systemic disorder is treated. If left untreated, however, metabolic encephalopathy may result in secondary structural damage to the brain. Most encephalopathies are present with neuropsychiatric symptoms, one in particular being depression. However, mood disorders are often co‐morbid with cardiovascular, liver, kidney and endocrine disorders, while increasing evidence concurs that depression involves inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. This would suggest that metabolic disturbances resembling encephalopathy may underscore the basic neuropathology of depression at a far deeper level than currently realized. Viewing depression as a form of encephalopathy, and exploiting knowledge gleaned from our understanding of the neurochemistry and treatment of metabolic encephalopathy, may assist in our understanding of the neurobiology of depression, but also in realizing new ideas in the pharmacotherapy of mood disorders.

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes.

Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico.

      "abstract": "Unmada (a broad term which denotes various psychiatric problems under one umbrella) is a major psychiatric illness described in all Ayurvedic classics which is characterized by deranged mental functions. The etymological meaning of Unmada is \"a state of disturbed mental functions.\" Kaphaja Unmada is one among the five types of Unmada, which is caused by the aggravation of Kapha dosha. The description of Kaphaja Unmada is available in all classical texts of Ayurveda along with its symptomatology. Previous works have correlated \"Kaphaja Unmada\" with \"depressive disorder\"/\"depression\"/\"major depressive disorder.\" The symptomatology of Kaphaja Unmada and depressive disorder is 70% similar, but some of the signs and symptoms of Kaphaja Unmada such as laala sighanaka sravanam, swapna nityata, svayathuranane, shukla stimita malopadigdha akshata, naari priyata, chhardi, balam cha bhukte, ushnasevi, nakhadi shauklyam, kasa, and raatrau bhrisham are not seen in depressive disorders and they denote hypersomnia, puffiness of face, pernicious or megaloblastic anemia, hypersexual behavior, vomiting, nocturnal and postprandial aggravation, cold intolerance, depression, and dementia conditions which are due to the underlying hypothyroidism instead of depression only. These signs and symptoms can be explained in a better way when Kaphaja Unmada is compared with myxedema/hypothyroidism with depression. The present study considers that Kaphaja Unmada is more similar with hypothyroidism with depression/myxedema madness/myxedema psychosis than primary depression/typical depression alone.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (SYNGAP1) is abundantly expressed in the postsynaptic space in brain tissue and has a crucial role in the regulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance and in brain development. It is estimated that SYNGAP1 loss of function variants have an incidence of 1 to 4/10,000 individuals, mostly occurring de novo, even if few cases of vertical transmission of mosaic mutations have been reported. Loss-of-function mutations within this gene have been related with an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by eyelid myoclonia with absences (EMA) and myoclonic-atonic seizures (MAE) with early onset, commonly resistant to antiepileptic drugs (AED). Epilepsy is often associated with other clinical features, including truncal and/or facial hypotonia and/or ataxia with a wide-based and unsteady gate. Other clinical signs are intellectual disability, developmental delay, and behavioral and speech impairment, in a context of a normal neuroimaging study. In selected cases, dysmorphic features, skeletal abnormalities, and eye involvement are also described. The diagnosis of the disorder is usually established by multigene panel and, in unsolved cases, by exome sequencing. Management of the affected individuals involves different specialists and is mainly symptomatic. No clinical trials about the efficacy of AED in SYNGAP1 encephalopathy have been performed yet and Lamotrigine and valproate are commonly prescribed. In more than half of cases, however, epilepsy is refractory to AED.",

      "abstract": "1. The undiagnosed cases in institution psychiatry present interesting problems as to diagnosis and prognosis. 2. Many case histories are lacking in clear description of historical facts, conduct disorders, stream of speech, etc. 3. Undiagnosed cases should be followed up most carefully. The average hurried and perfunctory note is only a little better than no note at all. 4. Conclusions without a statement of facts are misleading. Terms such as rambling, confused and violent should be used very cautiously in the primary case record. 5. Undiagnosed cases should be represented as often as new facts discovered will warrant. 6. In a considerable percentage of undiagnosed cases, disagreement and hesitation upon the part of the staff indicate, though oftentimes unwittingly, a good prognosis. 7. Confusion and apprehension in an acute psychosis would seem to indicate dementia præcox more often than any other disorder. 8. The absence of definite hallucinosis in a case otherwise doubtful contributes to failure in classification. 9. There are depressions of psychogenic origin that are not manic-depressive in nature and these types often occur between the ages of 40 and 60 with recovery. 10. The senile-presenile state is uncertain ground. A return should be made to the Kraepelinian presenile grouping. 11. Psychiatry is so far from being an exact science that many cases must be left undiagnosed if the psychiatrist is to retain his self-respect. He can not honestly diagnose them all.",

The startle reflex (or startle response) is commonly measured in research studies by a blink response in humans, elicited by some startling stimulus such as a loud noise. The blink response is an early and reliable component of startle in humans. It occurs to stimuli in various sensory modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, cutaneous) and often begins within 30 ms after the onset of a sudden and intense stimulus.",

      "abstract": "Spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced paranoid hallucinatory psychosis (i.e., flashbacks) occasionally occurs in response to non-specific mild stress in drug-free patients with a history of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced psychosis. Stress sensitization associated with noradrenergic hyperactivity and increased dopamine release may be related to this flashbacks. Stressful frightening experiences as well as fear-related paranoid- hallucinatory states during methamphetamine use may be related to these stress sensitization. Robust noradrenergic hyperactivity with increased dopamine release may predicts subsequent flashback episodes. Schizophrenia-like symptoms (e.g., passivity phenomena, Gedankenlautwerden, and thought disorder such as circumstantiality and egorrhea symptoms) appear to develop related to dopaminergic hyperactivity. One of the dopamine receptor-encoding genes DRD2, TaqIA A1/A1 type, with which reduced density of the D2 receptor is associated, reduces to the risk of development of flashbacks. Stress sensitization has been proposed as a key step in the progression from vulnerability to an overt paranoidhallucinatory states, so that schizophrenia and flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis shares common underlying mechanisms of stress sensitization. Compared to flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis, psychedelic drug flashbacks are the recurrence of a perception learned while an individual is experiencing high anxiety levels, and thus recur in anxiety-related situations. Anxiety or fear during drug use is an important factor in the development of flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis and also psychedelic drug flashbacks. Dopaminergic and glutamatergic neural circuits including the striatum, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex play an important role in the development of psychostimulant-induced long-lasting behavioral sensitization. Immediate early genes expression in the particular brain regions affected by the psychostimulants is involved in this process. Furthermore, recent advances in molecular analysis could shed light on the fundamental mechanism involved, by identifying specific participating molecules such as delta FosB, NAC1, G-protein b1 subunit and methamphetamine-responsive transcript 1b.

Chronotype, which represents individual preferences for activity and performance, is associated with human health issues, particularly psychiatric disorders. This narrative review, which focuses on the relationship between chronotype and mental disorders, provides an insight into the potential mechanism. Recent evidence indicates that (1) the evening chronotype is a risk factor for depressive disorders and substance use disorders, whereas the morning chronotype is a protective factor. (2) Evening chronotype individuals with bipolar disorder tend to have more severe symptoms and comorbidities. (3) The evening chronotype is only related to anxiety symptoms. (4) The relationship between chronotype and schizophrenia remains unclear, despite increasing evidence on their link. (5) The evening chronotype is significantly associated with eating disorders, with the majority of studies have focused on binge eating disorders. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms or influence factors are described in detail, including clock genes, brain characteristics, neuroendocrinology, the light/dark cycle, social factors, psychological factors, and sleep disorders. These findings provide the latest evidence on chronotypes and psychiatric disorders and serve as a valuable reference for researchers.",

Other symptoms include delusions, thought disorder, psychomotor disturbances, and abnormal affect. To establish the diagnosis, one must rule out other disorders such as alcohol withdrawal delirium or other psychotic disorders. Although it is well recognised, relatively little is known about the condition. Moreover, the pathogenesis and treatment of AIPD are still unclear despite high co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders, high re-hospitalization as well as mortality rates and suicidal behaviour. Therefore, the prognosis appears less favourable. We present a case of young man with AIPD with suicidal attempt secondary to auditory hallucination.

The condition mimics psychotic hallucination, seizure, or other behavioral disorders, potentially causing management delay. We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage.A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial imaging revealed right parietal intracranial hemorrhage likely secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertension. Extensive workup and thorough clinical examination ruled out dementia, psychosis, seizure, or other behavioral disorders. The condition gradually improved without any specific intervention.Abnormality in auditory processing due to intracranial lesions affecting auditory cortical projections causes a variety of symptoms that mimic other conditions such as psychotic hallucinations, and ictal and postictal behavioral changes. Thorough characterization with detailed examination and workup may help in distinguishing one from the other. A rare form of palinacousis may occur after unilateral nondominant parietal lesion. The condition is self-limiting and requires no specific management. Ruling out seizure disorder or psychiatric condition may prevent unnecessary workup and treatment.",

      "title": "Pharmacological strategies in treatment-resistant depression",
      "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression may be due to factors such as co-morbid psychiatric or medical illnesses, chronic psychosocial stresses, and medication nonadherence. Alternative treatment strategies such as optimization, switching to a different antidepressant, augmentation or combination with another antidepressant are strategies useful in such patients. The first strategy in treating resistant depression is to optimize monotherapy. A switch should be made to another agent if there is no response to treatment after an adequate duration. Augmentation and combination strategies are useful if there is sub-optimal response to the initial antidepressant. With several antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the newer antidepresssants) and various antidepressant augmentation and combination strategies available to clinicians, the outcome of treating patients with depression should improve. Keywords: Depression, Treatment-resistant, Antidepressants, SSRIs, Tricyclics.

      "title": "On serotonin, psychedelics, entactogens and psychoplastogens in depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and related disorders.",
      "abstract": "There is controversy about a causal role of serotonin (5-HT) in depression, some arguing that there is no proof for impaired brain 5-HT function in depressed patients. Major depressive disorder comes with multiple endophenotypes; not surprisingly classical antidepressants (tricyclics, MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, SNRIs) are not universally effective. Most antidepressants target the 5-HT system, partially if not exclusively, but treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains a major issue. The most recent and heavily investigated class of potential rapid acting antidepressant, anxiolytic, and/or anti PTSD drugs, namely psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, DMT, ayahuasca, etc..) or entactogens (MDMA, ibogaine), all target the 5-HT system, at least in part. Phase II / III clinical trials support psychedelics- and/or MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a new class of rapid acting treatments for GAD, MDD, TRD, PTSD, and other disorders. Psilocybin and MDMA have FDA breakthrough status for TRD/MDD and PTSD, respectively, whereas LSD just received FDA breakthrough status for GAD. All psychedelics act as 5-HT2A receptor agonists, although LSD, DMT, psilocybin may also target other 5-HT and/or dopamine receptors. Psychedelics produce rapid onset and long-lasting antidepressant effects after one or two administrations. They all promote synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Neuroinflammation plays a major role in anxiety, depression, PTSD. Interestingly, psychedelic-induced 5-HT2A receptor agonism has profound anti-(neuro)inflammatory effects. Altogether, the 5-HT system plays an essential, but not unique role in MDD and related disorders. MDD, TRD and PTSD may be considered as biochemical, neurological and immune conditions, given the emerging role of neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation, which until recently, have been overlooked.",

      "abstract": "In psychiatry, one of the main factors contributing to poor response to pharmacological treatment is adherence. Noncompliance with maintenance treatments for chronic illnesses such as schizophrenia and affective disorders can exceed 50%, Poor adherence can be due to drug-related factors (tolerance, complexity of prescription, side effects, or cost), patient-related variables (illness symptoms, comorbidity, insight capacity, belief system, or sociocultural environment), and physician-related factors (communication or psychoeducational style). Psychosocial treatments must be used in conjunction with medication during the maintenance phase to improve adherence to treatment and to achieve - through the management of psychological variables - better social, work, and family functioning. This article reviews the concepts of adherence and noncompliance, and their impact on maintenance treatments, as well as the effect of dealing with psychosocial factors in psychiatric treatment.",

A general scenario includes the victim being drugged and severely incapacitated, usually in a situation that he/she perceives as non-threatening. The victim then loses consciousness within a short period of time after drinking a spiked beverage or food. When the victim regains consciousness sometimes later, the victim finds himself/herself in unfamiliar surroundings, partially or fully undressed, often with inexplicable injuries and no memory of what had happened. Due to feeling of guilt, shame and fear of retaliation, the reporting rate of such cases is very low.\r\n\r\nBuilding on years of research on forensic investigation of DFSA, we highlight a number of issues, including motives behind drink spiking, common myths and facts, examples of recent cases, types of drugs involved, analysis of different sample types and the factors for underreporting of the cases. Findings will be shared from a recent survey based research on knowledge, perception and experience about DFSA and provide some useful takeaway tips on how to stay safe from drink spiking.",

      "title": "17q12 Recurrent Duplication",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics The 17q12 recurrent duplication is characterized by intellectual abilities ranging from normal to severe disability and other variable clinical manifestations. Speech delay is common, and most affected individuals have some degree of hypotonia and gross motor delay. Behavioral and psychiatric conditions reported in some affected individuals include autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and behavioral abnormalities (aggression and self-injury). Seizures are present in 75%. Additional common findings include microcephaly, ocular abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities. Short stature and renal and cardiac abnormalities are also reported in some individuals. Penetrance is incomplete and clinical findings are variable. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by detection of the 1.4-megabase heterozygous recurrent duplication at chromosome 17q12 by chromosomal microarray testing or other genomic methods. Management Treatment of manifestations: Those with developmental delays, cognitive disability, and/or behavioral problems should be evaluated by a neurodevelopmental pediatrician or clinical psychologist/psychiatrist. Seizures should be managed by a neurologist using standard practice. Feeding therapy as needed. Individuals with vision, endocrine, cardiac, and/or renal abnormalities should be managed by the appropriate specialist. Surveillance: Regular assessment of psychomotor development is recommended for all children with the 17q12 recurrent duplication as well as psychological evaluation in both affected children and adults. Monitor for new-onset seizures, growth and nutritional assessment, and assessment of family needs at each visit. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment is warranted in at-risk relatives to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones in childhood or psychological assessment/intervention through adulthood. Genetic counseling The 17q12 recurrent duplication is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with approximately 10% of duplications occurring de novo and approximately 90% inherited from a parent who is often minimally affected or phenotypically normal. Prenatal testing for an at-risk pregnancy requires prior identification of the duplication in an affected family member. Interpretation of results from prenatal testing is challenging given the inherent difficulty in accurately predicting the phenotype.",

The interview not only is diagnostic, but it can also be therapeutic. Use open-ended questions, such as, “Tell me about your headaches,” “Tell me in your own words how headaches affect your life,” or “What else can you tell me about your headaches?” After presenting the patient with a list of therapeutic options described here, always ask, “What do you think about these options? Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

      "abstract": "Critically ill patients with a primary neurological injury or illness pose unique challenges for pain, agitation, and delirium management in intensive care units (ICUs). Detection and monitoring can be limited by contextual level of consciousness (LOC) alterations, cognition, expression, or language deficits. Recent data suggest that existing pain assessment tools may not be applicable to all neurocritically ill patients, especially in those with LOC alterations and atypical pain-associated behaviors. Targeted sedation goals may be neurologically disease specific; for instance, intracranial pressure (ICP) targets will supersede sedation titration by other criteria. Technology such as bispectral index (BIS) may be beneficial in avoiding excessive medication administration in deeply sedated neurologically injured ICU patients. Given the wide variety of pathology in the neurocritically ill patients, it is unclear if delirium can be diagnosed and unequivocally differentiated from symptoms of the underlying neurological pathology. However, delirium symptoms may herald life-threatening primary insult progression or result from a new secondary neurological injury and should be monitored. Patients with neurological injury or illness are often excluded from ICU studies addressing pain, sedation, and delirium, but this need not be the case. We review what is understood in this area based on current evidence.",
