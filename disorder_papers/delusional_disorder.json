      "title": "Brief Psychotic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder (BPD) according to DSM-5 is the sudden onset of psychotic behavior that lasts less than 1 month followed by complete remission with possible future relapses. It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "abstract": "Mental Exaltation, Mania .—The question of the Prognosis in Mental Exaltation—Mania—in its various forms, is a far more debatable and uncertain matter than in melancholia. The symptoms in melancholia being of a negative character due to a lowering or suspension of brain activity, we do not look for all those diversities, endless varieties and aspects which we may find in mania, be it simple, acute, or chronic. Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

      "abstract": "Described over a century ago, schizophrenia still presents personal, clinical and scientific challenges, and is increasingly considered a concept rather than a single disorder. It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

It refers to a change in cognitive function that is severe enough to compromise an individual's daily function. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia. Dementia can further be defined by a possible, probable, or definite etiologic diagnosis. A degenerative dementia implies disease progression over time.",

Delusional disorder is the least disabling of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and involves the presence of one or more delusions of at least one-month duration. Delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech that have a sudden onset and return to normal within a month are indicative of a brief psychotic disorder. Schizophreniform disorder is an intermediate diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder and schizophrenia. Another important distinction separates schizophreniform disorder from a diagnosis of schizophrenia—level of impairment. Symptoms of schizophrenia are the same as for schizophreniform disorder, except for the duration criteria, which must last at least 6 months. Schizoaffective disorder is one of the least understood disorders in DSM-5 . It includes symptoms of a mood disorder along with symptoms of a cognitive disorder, with the duration and severity of each being crucial for diagnosis.",

Its primary symptoms are \"severe, recurrent temper outbursts\" (manifested verbally and/or physically) superimposed on and associated with chronic irritability. DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

      "abstract": "We present diagnostic criteria for mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS) for inclusion into the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders. The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by two or more years of recurrent and intermittent mood episodes in which the individual oscillates or “cycles” between periods of depression and hypomania, with or without normal periods interspersed between the depressive and hypomanic states. Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

      "abstract": "textabstractBipolar disorder (also called manic-depressive illness) is one of the major mood disorders. The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "title": "Bipolar and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorders feature a distinct period of mania or hypomania. For example, a patient might develop a relatively acute onset of euphoria, diminished need for sleep, grandiosity, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and a variety of behavioral indiscretions. Absent complicating factors, such a patient would likely be readily identified as having a manic episode as part of bipolar I disorder. Complicating factors abound in diagnosing bipolar and related disorders, however, which is one reason that this chapter features an abundance of cases. Most of the complications relate to symptom evaluation. DSM-5 identified seven symptoms that tend to cluster in bipolar I disorder, and the diagnosis of mania requires three of these symptoms. Each of the symptoms requires clinical judgment in regard to both duration and intensity, and certain problems, such as \"distractibility\" and \"reduced need for sleep,\" are not always obvious during a clinical evaluation. A diagnosis of mania requires that symptoms from this cluster persist for most of the day, every day, for at least a week. This standard requires an accurate history, which can be difficult to obtain from any patient, but particularly from a patient who may have little insight into the presence of a psychiatric problem (as is often the case for individuals with bipolar disorder). An accurate bipolar history is even more difficult to obtain when the presenting symptom is depression, and manic symptoms might not have been present for many years. Half of patients with bipolar disorder use illicit substances, which can complicate the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. Depression is so commonly found in bipolar disorder that the disorder was previously called \"manic depression.\" The relationship between the two mood states is not always clear, however, which is one reason that bipolar and related disorders were shifted into a separate chapter in DSM-5. As it turns out, depression can be absent in bipolar disorder, but it can also be the dominant mood state in regard to both frequency and intensity of symptoms. Mood can oscillate between the two poles of depression and mania, or the two can coexist (e.g., a mood episode with mixed features). The relationship between the depressive and manic symptoms is made even more complicated by the reality that patients are more likely to spontaneously complain about dysphoria than about euphoria. Finally, as is generally the case for disorders throughout DSM-5, a bipolar diagnosis requires impairment. Some of the core symptoms of mania—increased activity, euphoria, and talkativeness—can lead to increased effectiveness and pleasure, at least in the short term, which further complicates the assessment. DSM-5 addressed these uncertainties by describing multiple syndromes within the bipolar spectrum. For example, diagnoses of mania and hypomania both require \"three of seven listed criteria, most of the day, nearly every day.\" However, mania requires at least one episode lasting at least 7 days, whereas hypomania requires only a 4-day duration. Instead of requiring a marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, as specified for mania, hypomania requires an unequivocal change from baseline that is observable by others. These criteria take into consideration the reality that manic and hypomanic patients often lack insight, and the criteria emphasize that hypomania is less severe than mania. Hypomania is a key feature of DSM-5 bipolar II disorder. A second distinguishing feature of bipolar II disorder is the requirement for at least one major depressive episode at a time when hypomanic symptoms are not present. This requirement is in contrast to bipolar I disorder, which does not require the historical presence of depression. Other patients may have classic manic or hypomanic symptoms but with an apparent physiological precipitant. For example, a patient may have developed manic symptoms immediately after receiving prednisone, a steroid, for a flare-up of systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). In this case, the clinician might conclude that the patient has bipolar disorder, which would presumably warrant a mood-stabilizing medication. Alternatively, the patient may have had a fairly common reaction to steroids and warrant a diagnosis of medication-induced bipolar disorder (a disorder commonly and inaccurately labeled \"steroid psychosis\"); if so, a likely treatment would be reduction of the steroid medication. The patient's symptoms may, however, be best conceptualized as neuropsychiatric lupus, which in DSM-5 would be called bipolar disorder due to another medical condition. In that case, however, the patient might be best treated by an increase in steroids. One reason that the bipolar diagnosis is so hotly contested is that making the correct diagnosis is vitally important for patient care. The bipolar spectrum also includes clusters of individuals whose mania-related symptoms are significant but who do not meet criteria for bipolar I or II disorder by virtue of the number or duration of symptoms. For example, some patients have a chronic course of alternating hypomanic and subthreshold depressive symptoms. To reach the diagnostic threshold for DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder, these symptoms need to be distressing and persistent (more days than not for at least 2 years—1 year in adolescents—with no more than 2 months without symptoms), and the individual should never have met criteria for a manic episode or a major depressive episode. DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder is quite parallel to DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder in regard to both duration and intensity of symptoms. Other patients have significant manic symptoms, but an adequate history is not elicited because of the situation (e.g., an emergency room visit); in such cases, the diagnosis would be unspecified bipolar and related disorder. A variety of other patients are diagnosed with other specified bipolar and related disorder. These include people whose manic symptoms either persist for an inadequate duration (e.g., only 2–3 days rather than the required 4 days) or persist for greater than 4 days but do not meet the three of seven symptomatic criteria for hypomania. Still others meet criteria for hypomania but lack a history of major depressive disorder and therefore do not meet criteria for bipolar II disorder. Others have chronic hypomania and subthreshold depressive symptoms but do not meet the 24-month criterion for cyclothymia. Bipolar spectrum diagnoses have generated significant controversy. One issue relates to duration. It is difficult to make a diagnosis in which the symptoms need be present for only a few days and do not necessarily cause significant distress. Another complication relates to symptom intensity. Distinguishing normal from abnormal is not always easy when the variables include such core human behaviors as talkativeness, risk taking, need for sleep, and self-esteem. To address this controversy, DSM-5 balances two competing interests. The first is to identify robust, discrete symptom clusters that occur within distressed patients. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for a cluster of disorders that cause significant dysfunction and distress and are accompanied by a lifetime risk of suicide that is more than 20 times that in the general population. The second competing interest is to avoid pathologizing normal human experience. Absent reliable tests for \"bipolar disorder,\" the onus is on the clinician to make use of these criteria and to follow available evidence in both the diagnosis and treatment of these challenging patients.",

The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor.

DSM-IV classification: requires the presence of obsessions or compulsions unrelated to another axis 1 diagnosis. Symptoms must be distressing, time-consuming (more than 1 h/day), and must interfere with activities or relationships. The person must recognize that the obsessions are excessive and unreasonable.

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

The adoption of a lumping strategy for mood disorders, particularly for classifying depressive disorders, reflects the perspective of depression as a unitary construct that represents a final common pathway derived from a variety of etiological and pathophysiological sources, which accounts for the shared clinical features seen in the heterogeneous groups of depressive disorders. A diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE) is made by recognizing the characteristic syndrome of symptoms that cluster together during the same period of time. The hallmark of manic and hypomanic episodes is a discrete period of abnormally elevated, euphoric, expansive, or irritable mood that persists for at least a week in the case of mania or at least 4 days in the case of hypomania. Major depressive disorder is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes.",

Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

      "title": "Syndromes of Brain Dysfunction Presenting with Cognitive Impairment or Behavioral Disturbance: Delirium, Dementia, and Mental Disorders Caused by a General Medical Condition",
      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "title": "Understanding subthreshold depression.",
      "abstract": "The concept of subsyndromal, subthreshold or sub-case depression has received considerable attention in recent decades. Judd and colleagues[1] — who reported that patients with depression are symptomatic more than 60% of the time and that most of that time is spent in subthreshold states— proposed the following operational definition of subsyndromal depression: ‘two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia.’\r\n\r\nDistinguishing major depressive disorder from subthreshold depression and distinguishing the different types of subthreshold depression from each other is one example of a fundamental limitation of our current psychiatric nosology. The elaborate classification systems currently in use in psychiatry are based on subjective descriptions of symptoms. The detailed phenomenology includes descriptions of multiple overlapping clinical subtypes, but there are no biological characteristics that distinguish one subtype from another. Moreover, different disorders can exhibit similar clinical symptoms and the same disorder can have different symptomatic patterns in different individuals.[2] In the absence of biological markers, establishing thresholds in terms of frequency, duration or severity of symptoms that define when a symptom cluster becomes ‘psychopathological’ and that distinguish one symptom cluster from another symptom cluster will always be problematic.\r\n\r\nThe original hope for ICD-10 and DSM-IV was that the diagnostic emphasis on observable behaviors (rather than on presumed cognitions) would advance the reliability and validity of the diagnostic categories. Based on this approach, the core entity of depressive disorders in DSM-IV became a uniform major depressive disorder with modifiers for different subtypes (e.g., psychotic or atypical) and for circumstances presumed to have clinical significance (e.g., seasonal or postpartum depression).[3]–[5] The authors of ICD-10 recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of affective disorders but did not feel that the related science was sufficiently mature: ‘the relationship between etiology, symptoms, underlying biochemical processes, response to treatment, and outcome of mood [affective] disorders is not yet sufficiently well understood to allow their classification in a way that is likely to meet with universal approval’.[5],[9] The reported emphasis of the upcoming DSM-5 on the dimensional aspects of psychopathology may provide an opportunity to more clearly characterize the different manifestations of the different subthreshold conditions along the depressive continuum, but this remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that the depressive symptoms at the major, minor, dysthymic or subsyndromal levels are all integral components of the longitudinal clinical structure of major depressive disorder (MDD), with each symptom level representing a different phase of illness intensity, activity and severity.[1],[2],[6],[7] The different depressive disorders included in official diagnostic systems (i.e., MDD, minor depression, dysthymia) and subsyndromal depression do not represent discrete disorders but, rather, are stages along a dimensional continuum of symptomatic severity.\r\n\r\nOvercoming the current nosological problems will require changing the current phenomenology-based classification system to a classification system based on reliable neurobiological findings that takes into consideration the remarkable synchronization of psychological, social and cultural factors with biochemistry and physiology.[3],[4] Studies of the relationship of stress and illness[2],[4] that clarify the inter-related roles of social, psychological and biological factors in the cause, course and outcomes of mental disorders provide one clear example of the potential benefits of this more integrative approach to the conceptualization of mental disorders.\r\n\r\nIt is now broadly accepted that psychological stress may change the internal homeostatic state of an individual. During acute stress adaptive physiological responses occur, including the increased adrenocortical secretion of hormones, primarily cortisol.[2]–[4] Several authors hypothesize that prolonged dysfunction of the stress response system, characterized by either hyper- or hypo-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, plays a central role in the etiology and course of mood disorders. There is accumulating evidence supporting the suggestion that depressive disorders include individuals with different treatment response profiles who have abnormalities in HPA axis activity and in immune functions.[3]–[5],[8],[9]\r\n\r\nDespite the fluctuating operational criteria and the current lack of definitive biomarkers for subthreshold depressive states, it is clear that the various subthreshold depressive conditions have a high prevalence in the community and are all associated with psychosocial disability, poor quality of life, and high healthcare costs that increase incrementally in parallel with increases in symptom severity.[1],[6],[7] Moreover, individuals with any of the subtypes of subthreshold depression are more likely to experience full-criteria episodes of MDD and to progress into a persistent, fluctuating depressive condition. Thus, research advances in understanding the neurobiology of subthreshold depression and the related development of evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for these conditions could substantially decrease the morbidity associated with subthreshold depressive symptoms that, in spite of their high prevalence and impact, are often overlooked, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.",

Patients have to be back at their baseline functional level once the disorder has resolved. This is a heterogeneous group of patients who have either a disorder similar to schizophrenia or something closer to a mood disorder. Objectives To analyze clinical, psychopathological and epidemiological characteristics of schizophreniform disorder and also review causes, incidence, prevalence, diagnostic, therapeutic tools and the importance of maintaining the treatment, because of the abandonment of the treatment, which is a predictor of relapses. Methods A review of the main impact literature concerning schizophreniform disorder is done during the last five years: prevalence, incidence, pathogenesis and its relationship with other psychiatric disorders encoded in DSM-V are studied. Results The etiology is unknown. Psychotic symptoms can be treated with antipsychotics for 3 to 6 months. They usually respond faster than patients with schizophrenia (75% vs 20% respond within 8 days). Conclusions The disease has a favorable prognosis, and has similarities with mood disorders. However, some data suggest a close relationship to schizophrenia. In support of the relationship with mood disorders, patients have more affective symptoms and a better outcome than patients with schizophrenia. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "abstract": "The Somatoform Disorders class was created for clinical utility and not on the basis of an assumed common etiology or mechanism. The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues. Considering the major anxiety disorders, the somatic symptoms in Panic Disorder tend to appear initially in discrete episodes. The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s). Pain disorder associated with a general medical condition was not considered to be a mental disorder, because the requirement was not met that psychological factors play an important role.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has been used for many years to describe disturbances of mood or physical symptoms occurring regularly 7–10 days before menses and remitting during menses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III-R) included PMS among the ‘proposed Diagnostic Categories Needing Further Study’ under the name of Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), and established among its diagnostic criteria the need for daily prospective symptoms self-ratings during at least two cycles, for confirmation [1]. The more recent fourth edition of DSM maintained PMS among the categories needing further study, adding the new category of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) [2]. PMDD is distinguished from PMS in several respects: It requires at least one mood symptom; the symptoms must be severe enough to cause functional impairment, and they must not be a mere exacerbation of another psychiatric disorder. Since no other diagnostic criteria have been proposed, many studies have compared the scores from the premenstrual and follicular phases: a 30–50% increase found in prospectively administered diaries is now normally accepted as an indicator of the diagnosis of PMS [3], no attention being paid to the quality of symptoms. On the other hand, no specific hormone changes or other biological markers are able to distinguish between PMS sufferers and normal women [4]. Therefore, the absence of both a universally accepted definition and an objective biological or clinical marker makes it impossible to study the etiology of PMS. Accordingly, the therapeutic approach is presently indefinite. Steinberg [5] correctly stated that the time-honored medical adage maintaining that ‘in the absence of cure, treatments multiply’ seems to be appropriate to PMS. Nevertheless, it is well accepted that the severe form of PMS, i.e. the one characterized by psychosocial impairment and thus requiring medical treatment, is present in 5–8% of women during their 40s. This implies that we should multiply our efforts toward the understanding of the disorder.",

      "title": "Whiplash headache: Does the diagnosis make more harm than the whiplash?",
      "abstract": "According to the study of Obermann et al. in the current issue of Cephalalgia, headache after whiplash injury is a self-limiting condition with a good prognosis. Although 4.6% fulfilled criteria for chronic whiplash headache, i.e. still having headache after 3 months, none had headache lasting more than 1 year. Predictors for headache lasting > 3 months were medication overuse, pre-existing pain conditions, and several psychological factors. Another factor, sore throat after the whiplash, was somewhat speculatively interpreted as a possible result of musculoskeletal damage. The headaches were mostly compatible with tension-type headache (TTH). Although the study has a positive message, that the headache subsides in less than a year, it also demonstrates some very problematic aspects of the whiplash headache entity. First, the criteria contain no description of the headache itself. It is sufficient that the headache and neck pain occur within 7 days after an event with a possible whiplash mechanism. For the chronic whiplash headache, it is required that the headache persists for > 3 months after the accident, but there is no requirement that the headache occurs with a certain frequency. This is in contrast to, for example, chronic TTH, where the headache must occur on more than half of the days for > 3 months. Quite wisely, therefore, the authors have in their definition of chronic headache added the requirement that the headache shall occur daily or near daily. Nevertheless, to find enough patients with ‘chronic’ headache for the analysis, they also used the criteria of the Quebec task force (QTF), but also these criteria have no definition of chronicity. An even more problematic aspect of the chronic whiplash headache entity is that, according to the very lax International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) criteria, in principle any headache that occurs in an individual for years after the event can be classified as chronic whiplash headache, provided that there was head and neck pain during the first week. This is so even though this single event leaves no trace in the body that can be demonstrated by objective means, and even if the headache resembles the naturally occurring primary headaches, as demonstrated in this and previous studies (1,2). This issue is even more crucial after the demonstration that even sham whiplash accidents, involving virtually no physical forces but many psychological stressors, could induce head and neck pain in up to 20% of the exposed individuals within the first days after the event (3), hence allowing a diagnosis of whiplash headache according to the current ICHD-II criteria. Thus, it may be that so-called whiplash headache mostly or even exclusively represents primary headache induced by the stress of the situation (2). Theoretically, it is highly unsatisfactory to have a headache category named after each type of precipitant for headache episodes, psychological or other. From a practical viewpoint, it is probably unsound to name the headache after the whiplash event if the headache is a primary headache, particularly since most patients and health professionals will then tend to understand the aetiology in terms of a physical injury to head and neck structures. Many unhealthy practices (e.g. use of a neck collar, hazardous neck operations) that may increase the complaints stem from a traumatic conception of the headache, and the prognosis of headache after rear-end collisions seems to be best in cultures where the traumatic event is ignored (4). In the present study the incidence of chronic headache is consistent with the prevalence figures of chronic headache seen in population-based studies, and the authors wisely comment that development of chronicity in this whiplash group may have similar pathophysiological or clinical mechanisms to chronic headache in general. In my opinion, this raises the issue of whether whiplash headache is a biologically meaningful entity, i.e. caused by injury to head or neck structures. To solve this problem, descriptive case series based on patients presenting in an emergency room or to a",

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Myoclonic status epilepticus (MSE) is defined as prolonged continuous or discontinuous clusters of epileptic myoclonus, with or without impairment of consciousness. 1 MSE is a heterogeneous condition that has been described in generalized epilepsy syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases, toxic-metabolic states, and following anoxic brain injury. 2Acute symptomatic MSE usually occurs after prolonged anoxia or metabolic insults. 1 Except for acute symptomatic seizures, MSE is rarely reported in patients who do not have a history of epilepsy. 1This case study explores MSE of unknown etiology in an elderly patient who did not have a history of seizures.A 76-year-old woman presented with sudden clusters of irregular myoclonic twitching without impairment of consciousness, which had developed 1 day prior to seeking treatment.The myoclonic jerks had first appeared in the lower face and spread bilaterally to the shoulders and upper arms.They occurred with a high frequency (more than dozens of times per minute), and each cluster lasted a few seconds.The patient denied any history of seizures or morning jerks.She suffered from ischemic heart disease and had taken medications including nicorandil, aspirin, clopidogrel, and pravastatin several years previously.She did not report any other medical illness or additional medications, and denied any history of withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines.The patient was alert and oriented during her myoclonic jerks.She had experienced mild memory difficulties during the previous several years, but she reported no impairment in the activities of daily living.Laboratory findings were unremarkable, including the levels of glucose, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and the findings of liver function tests, thyroid function tests, and arterial blood gas.Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed no acute abnormality (Fig. 1A).Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed bilateral subcortical ischemic lesions (Fig. 1B).Gradient echo imaging did not reveal any hemorrhagic lesions or microbleeds (Fig. 1C).Electroencephalogram (EEG) displayed abundant bursts of high-voltage generalized polyspikes with a normal background.In addition, generalized asymmetric spikes were observed between or preceding the bursts (Fig. 1E).Myoclonic movements were time-locked with the bursts of generalized polyspikes.The patient was initially treated intravenously with a loading dose of valproic acid (800 mg), followed by the oral administration of valproic acid (900 mg/day) beginning the next day.The myoclonic seizures almost completely resolved after single intravenous valproic acid infusion.The patient received oral valproic acid for 1 year and remained free of myoclonic seizures after valproic acid was discontinued up to the follow-up examination conducted after 3 years.This case was an elderly patient who presented with late-onset MSE without any previous history of epilepsy.Except in generalized epilepsy syndromes (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and progressive myoclonic epilepsy), MSE is usually associated with anoxic ischemic injury,",

      "abstract": "Delirium can be conceptualized as an acute decline in cognitive function that typically lasts from hours to a few days. Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

If that discrete and sustained discharge occurs in the temporal lobe or limbic region of the brain, the condition is referred to as nonconvulsive complex partial status epilepticus (discussed in Chapter 10). If the discharge is ongoing in systems that subserve language function, an aphasia may result (see Chapter 11). This chapter will deal with the disorders and conditions associated with FSE arising from other regions of the brain. This condition can be associated with a wide variety of neurologic disorders and have a multitude of signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms vary according to the function of the brain area engaged by the discharge and can be as simple as a repetitive movement, as seen in epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), or as subtle as an inability to write to command (see case example).",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan).

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "The DSM-IV criteria for mania require: a distinct period that represents a break from pre-morbid functioning, a duration of at least one week, elevated or irritable mood, at least three to four classical manic signs and symptoms and the absence of any physical factors. Although not specifically mentioned in the ICD-10 or the DSM-IV definitions, delusional, hallucinatory, even first-rank, psychotic experiences can occur in mania. Acute mania can be subdivided into classical pure mania, mania with mood-congruent or mood-incongruent psychosis, mixed state and rapid-cycling mania. One quarter to two thirds of all manic episodes are associated with delusions, while 13% to 40% are associated with hallucinations. Mixed episode is a complex syndrome which is difficult to diagnose, has the most prolonged duration of bipolar episodes and more frequent psychotic profile than pure mania with high suicidality and poor response to drugs. Mixed state mania has been well known since Kreapelin and listed in classification systems with criteria that include both a manic and a major depressive episode nearly every day for at least a one-week period. On the other hand, mixed-like episodes that are clearly caused by somatic antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electro-convulsive therapy or light therapy) should not contribute toward a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder. Although, theoretically, mania is supposed to be resolved within 1-3 months even without treatment, psychiatric hospitalization is very common in especially severe cases due to functional impairment. Current treatments for mania aim to control the agitation, impulsivity, aggression and psychotic symptoms and to help patients regain their pre-morbid functionality. However, the clinical management of mania is challenging as most patients show syndromal remission but incomplete functional recovery after the first episode of mania.",

      "title": "Hot off the press: <scp>MRI</scp> sensitivity for transient global amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an idiopathic acute neurological disorder that presents with sudden onset anterograde memory loss. It was first described as a syndrome in 1956 by Courjon and Guyotat1 and also by Bender.2 Fisher and Adams formally described TGA in 1964.3 The usual presentation is a patient between 50 and 70 years of age who is cognitively and neurologically intact but asking repetitive questions and unable to form new memories. Symptoms are short-lived and resolve within 24 h. The incidence has been reported as 23.5 per 100,000 people per year and is more common in people who get migraine headaches.4, 5 TGA is often precipitated by physical or emotional stressors, pain, the Valsalva maneuver, hot or cold water immersion, or sexual intercourse.6 The criterion standard of TGA diagnosis combines seven clinical criteria: the attack is witnessed, there is clear anterograde amnesia, the absence of other neurological symptoms during the attack, the absence of abnormal neurological examination findings, memory loss is less than 24 h, there are no epileptic features or history of same, and there is no recent head injury.7 The workup of TGA can include laboratory testing, EEG, ECG, echocardiography, and advanced neuroimaging. This is a systematic review of observational studies of TGA. It included adult patients with a diagnosis of TGA based on existing clinical criteria who were evaluated with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at varying time intervals (e.g., 0–12 h, 12–24 h) after symptom onset. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of DW-MRI in diagnosis of TGA. DW-MRI had low sensitivity for TGA early after symptom onset, but the sensitivity increased over time. The authors concluded that obtaining a DW-MRI in patients with a clinical diagnosis of TGA in the acute setting is likely a low-yield test. This was a good quality systematic review with a relevant diagnostic question, a detailed search strategy, and appropriate assessment of primary studies for common forms of bias. The major limitations of the included studies were the lack of precision (i.e., wide confidence intervals [CIs]) and high heterogeneity for estimates of DW-MRI sensitivity in diagnosing TGA. Heterogeneity as measured by the I2 test was very high at 72%–96% for most measured time points after symptom onset. Another limitation is that all studies included in this systematic review were observational in nature, with no randomized trials allocating patients to any time frame. Furthermore, although there were almost 1700 patients included in this review, there were still very few patients in some of the time points at which MRI was performed. This study also suffered from partial verification bias, also known as referral or workup bias. This occurs when only a certain set of patients who underwent the index test are verified by the reference standard. In this case, only those who met the clinical criteria for TGA had a DW-MRI performed, while patients who did not meet clinical criteria did not have an MRI. This could increase the overall sensitivity reported in the study. Finally, to get an accurate measure of sensitivity and specificity, we need a criterion standard to measure against. TGA is a clinical diagnosis, and the criterion standards used were the defined clinical criteria for the disease. This may be a somewhat uncertain criterion standard. Furthermore, if the criterion standard is clinical, the bedside physician already has access to the criterion standard diagnosis, and it is reasonable to ask what value an MRI could possibly add. Overall, 23 studies with a total of 1688 patients met inclusion criteria. All studies were case series of adult patients who were diagnosed with TGA clinically and who underwent DW-MRI. In the first 12 h from symptom onset, sensitivity of DW-MRI is 15.6%. Sensitivity improves thereafter to ranges as high as 83%, but there are very wide CIs for all point estimates and significant heterogeneity between studies. The Table 1 summarizes sensitivity of DW-MRI as a function of time interval from symptom onset. This study emphasizes the value of clinical criteria in the diagnosis of TGA and the low yield of DW-MRI testing. This is valuable information as it will reduce the unnecessary use of an expensive and time-consuming test in the acute setting. It is possible but unlikely that future prospective and randomized trials will change this. @shawnkdowling: Assuming there are no red flags, I do some basic labs and non-contrast CT head. I'd never considered ordering a DW-MRI and glad I do not need to based on this study. I typically consult neuro if the amnesia has not resolved at 12 h. @iwwalker: Textbook TGA does not need a neuro consult so consulting early likely keeps them unnecessarily in the ED for that, but cannot send them home until resolved regardless. If TGA is going on and on, I would also question the diagnosis, thus the referral. @Kapur_AK: Similar approach here. Our neurologists suggest we refer all as outpatients, which I'm okay with doing. I refer atypical or prolonged presentations in the ED (closer to 4–6 h). Ultimately the conclusion of emergency physicians weighing in on Twitter was not to order MRIs, while outpatient neurology consultation practices were variable. Clinical criteria remain the criterion standard in diagnosis of transient global amnesia. Early imaging with DW-MRI is a low-yield test and should not be performed in the emergency department.

The syndrome is quantitative rather than qualitative; that is, there are no clearly defined, outstanding symptoms. The onset is insidious and gradual, although the patient, usually a woman, may associate its beginning with some unusual dietary event, as a party, or indulgence above the ordinary in unusual foods. This event, however, should it occur, usually marks a culmination rather than a commencement. The several typical symptoms, which, let it be emphasized again, are quantitative rather than qualitative, are: (1) constipation; (2) fatigue, which is manifested by a marked disproportion between the mental desire for accomplishment and the physical inability of realization; (3) meteorism; (4) precordial or",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

Symptoms develop gradually and typically begin during young adulthood and are never resolved. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a psychiatric history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person. For a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the described symptoms need to have been present for at least six months (according to the DSM-5) or one month (according to the ICD-11). Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders, especially mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and obsessive–compulsive disorder.

These physical complaints are not consistent with the clinical picture of known, verifiable, conventionally defined diseases, and are unsupported by clinical or paraclinical findings. The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

In the new classification system DSM-III-R the concept of dysthymia is more clearly defined and delimited. It is there defined as a chronic mood disorder, particularly characteristic in cases with an early onset. Coexisting personality disturbance is relatively common. Dysthymia is a common kind of mood disorder. Often the symptoms are heterogeneous. In about one-third of the cases there are superimposed episodes of major depression, called double depression. As a result of the chronic course of dysthymia, dependence on alcohol or other substances is common. Double depression is relatively well suited to antidepressive treatment, whereas “pure” dysthymias, the mildest case in particular, show little response to antidepressant drugs. The concept of reactive depression is discussed. In DSM-III-R this is at present not included under mood disorders (but is found under adjustment disorders). There is no obvious reason why it should not be considered an additional kind of mood disorder.",

One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining. Therefore, prevention is the key.\r\n Main components of prevention are education and follow up.\r\n Balance between optimal training and recovery is a strategy of success.\r\n Right amount od training overload and enough time to rest will result in an additional motivation, as psychological, and as physiological set out for new triumph.",

We tested our clinical observation that development of disruptive agitation is more likely in semantic than in nonfluent PPA and examined which clinical variables could be associated with this behavior.We retrospectively analyzed neuropsychiatric scores and the need for behavioral treatments in semantic PPA (n = 41) and nonfluent PPA (n = 39) cases and compared first (1-3 years since the onset of symptoms) and last (5-13 years since the onset) evaluations. Clinical variables and laterality of temporal atrophy were associated with symptoms in semantic PPA cases.The semantic PPA group developed more frequent (p = 0.03) and intense agitation (p = 0.0008) and had a greater need for antipsychotic drugs (p = 0.001) than the nonfluent PPA group. Presence of agitation was clearly associated with psychotic symptoms (delusions/hallucinations) but was not associated with gender, age at onset, duration of the disease, or laterality of temporal atrophy. In contrast, nonfluent PPA cases were more frequently depressed and treated with antidepressants (p = 0.0007). There were no differences in anxiety, irritability, apathy, perseverations, hyperorality, or abnormal motor behavior.Semantic PPA in advanced disease is frequently associated with agitation and psychotic symptoms with fewer mood symptoms, while nonfluent PPA maintains a high prevalence of depression. This implies different treatment and care and support needs for each group.",

Those workers who would argue this point invariably introduce some special designation for the syndrome which is usually understood to be a disease entity.<sup>1</sup>My definition follows: Idiopathic epilepsy is a chronic, usually progressive, inherited disorder of the brain, characterized by periodically recurring convulsions (major seizures), lapses (minor seizures, petit mal or petit mal variant attacks) or behavior disturbances (psychomotor episodes) which occur in a person with no other demonstrable, relevant neurologic disease and with no recognized pathologic lesion except the cerebral dysrhythmia elicited by means of the electroencephalograph. The attacks are usually precipitated by some sort of metabolic disturbance,",

      "title": "\"Bipolar Family\"",
      "abstract": "Sir: When depression is preceded by a history of manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode, classifying it as bipolar depression rather than unipolar depression becomes straightforward. However, when there is no access to such history and the initial presentation is from the depressive end of the pole, correctly classifying the disorder as bipolar rather than unipolar then becomes difficult. Being able to correctly classify depression as bipolar rather than unipolar is crucial due to the ramifications of the diagnosis in terms of management. For example, it has been recommended that the depressive period of uncomplicated bipolar disorder should be treated for shorter periods than that for unipolar depression.1 Whereas in unipolar depression antidepressant monotherapy may be appropriate, in bipolar depression, without coupling it with a mood stabilizer, it may precipitate a “manic switch” and create a state of chronic irritable dysphoria and possibly a long-term rapid-cycling course.\r\n\r\nDue to symptomatic similarity between the 2 diagnostic entities, no particular symptom invariably distinguishes between the 2 disorders. However, if residents, psychiatrists, and family physicians can maintain a high index of suspicion, then certain factors from the past or present history would indicate that the depressive episode is more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar. We describe the mnemonic “Bipolar Family” to remind clinicians of factors or symptom clusters that would make a depressive episode more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar (Table 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\n“Bipolar Family”: Factors That Make a Depressive Episode More Likely To Be Bipolar Rather Than Unipolara\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the significant difference in treatment3 and despite the similarity in presentation, we hope that residents, psychiatrists, and primary care clinicians will utilize this mnemonic as a screening tool when faced with a patient who primarily presents with a depressive episode.",

Controversy surrounds the definition of delirium, because its manifestations are pleomorphic and its mechanisms poorly understood. The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), emphasizes four key features (Table 60.1). The first of these is disturbance of consciousness. Patients with delirium characteristically are less aware of their surroundings and have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. They become easily distracted and have difficulty following commands or maintaining a conversation. Accompanying delirium is an impairment of cognition and perception not attributable to prior or progressing dementia. This is manifested by memory problems, disorientation, misperceptions, hallucinations, and language problems (e.g., dysnomia, dysgraphia). The course of delirium is acute (defined as hours to days) and fluctuating (patients may be lucid during morning rounds yet combative or confused at night). Finally, delirium in an individual patient has one or more underlying medical etiologies.1 KeywordsFemoral Neck FractureNeuroleptic Malignant SyndromeAcute Confusional StateDelirious PatientElderly Medical PatientThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "Uncomplicated depression is normal sadness, not depressive disorder: further evidence from the NESARC",
      "abstract": "We write to update the results of our recent paper 1 suggesting that uncomplicated depressive episodes are not in fact disorders and should be excluded from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We also address some concerns expressed about our claims. The concept of \"uncomplicated depression\" is essentially a generalization to all stressors of the \"bereavement exclusion\" that appeared in DSM-IV (and was eliminated in DSM-5). Uncomplicated depression is defined as a response to a stressor that satisfies current DSM-5 five-symptoms-for-two-weeks criteria for MDD but is better explainable as a normal distress response, as evidenced by the fact that it lasts no longer than six months and does not include any of the following pathosuggestive symptoms: marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and psychomotor retardation. Uncomplicated episodes thus contain only depressive symptoms common in general distress reactions (e.g., sadness, moderate withdrawal or role impairment, decreased interest in usual activities, insomnia, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue). In our recent paper 1, using longitudinal data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study 2, we found that in those with lifetime uncomplicated MDD at baseline, the one-year recurrence rate (3.4%) was not significantly different from the background MDD incidence rate in those who never previously had MDD (1.7%), but both were dramatically lower than recurrence rates in other (\"complicated\") MDD (14.6%). Thus, in terms of recurrence risk, uncomplicated MDD is different from other MDD but indistinguishable from no-MDD-history. We concluded that \"consideration should be given to eliminating uncomplicated episodes as a class from MDD diagnosis\". However, that study had several limitations. We 3 therefore replicated and broadened the analysis using an entirely different, more recently collected longitudinal community data set – the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 4) – that allowed a more clinically meaningful 3-year follow-up window and use of an expanded set of three clinically important validators (depression recurrence, suicide attempt, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), as well as other advantages in measuring impairment and clinical significance. Due to data-set limitations, only single-episode uncomplicated cases could be evaluated in this study. The results were that people with single-episode uncomplicated major depression had rates during follow-up of MDD recurrence (6.9%), GAD (4.3%), and suicide attempt (0.1%) that were not significantly different from background rates for those who never had MDD (6.1%, 2.7%, and 0.3%, respectively), but were dramatically and significantly lower than rates for both single-episode complicated cases (19.5%, 7.8%, and 0.8%, respectively) and multiple-episode cases (27.1%, 11.2%, and 1.7%, respectively) 3. The results were not explainable by group differences in severity or treatment rates. Given the replication's success, we concluded that uncomplicated MDD is a benign condition that is typologically distinct from the rest of MDD, thus supporting our earlier thesis that uncomplicated MDD is in fact a form of normal sadness. However, in a commentary on the replication, Maj 5 expressed some concerns about the evidence provided by our study. These previously unaddressed concerns are now considered. In MDD, the quality of remission, and especially the number of residual depressive symptoms, is important both because subthreshold depression is harmful in itself and such symptoms predict recurrence and may indicate a latent pathology. Yet, Maj notes, our studies did not report the residual symptom levels among those not experiencing MDD during the follow-up. To address this concern, we analyzed the average number of MDD symptom groups experienced during follow-up by individuals in each of our baseline MDD groups who did not have recurrences during the follow-up period. In each of the four baseline wave 1 lifetime MDD history groups, the mean number of residual symptom groups experienced by those who had no wave 2 recurrences during the 3-year follow-up period was: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35-0.39) for the no lifetime MDD history group (N=25,514); 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=379); 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=1,756); and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.10) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=1,876). Thus, there is not a significant difference in the number of symptoms during follow-up between the no-MDD-history group and the uncomplicated single episode MDD group. There is no \"residual symptom\" problem indicating implicit pathology or risk of recurrence among the uncomplicated group above the non-MDD baseline. In contrast, the complicated single episode and multiple episode groups both experienced significantly higher residual symptom levels than the no-history and uncomplicated single episode groups. In sum, recovery in uncomplicated depression generally returns to population baseline levels of depressive symptoms, which is unlike the recoveries of those with other MDD. Maj 5 also argued that the 3-year follow-up may have been too short to detect recurrences in uncomplicated cases because recurrence after recovery can occur after longer intervals. He noted, for instance, that in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study, the median time to first recurrence of MDD in people who had fully recovered from their index episode was over 4 years 6. However, the baseline NESARC data used in our study were lifetime MDD data at interview 1. Thus, the duration of the follow-up was not just three years. In fact, many of the individuals classified with lifetime MDD at wave 1 had not had their last MDD episode for some years prior to the wave 1 interview, so the average time interval since recovery was potentially much greater than three years. Thus, to address Maj's concern, we calculated for each of our MDD groups the average time from the end of the last episode to the wave 1 interview to obtain a more accurate approximation of the time intervals from the last episode to the outcome reported for wave 2. The mean years of remission prior to wave 1 assessment for each group were: 9.1 (95% CI: 7.9-10.3) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=417); 9.1 (95% CI: 8.6-9.6) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=2128); and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.2) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=2501). Thus, the average time from the end of the last episode to the beginning of the wave 2 follow-up period was lengthy, about nine years for both uncomplicated and complicated single-episode cases and about four years for multiple episode cases. This substantial time interval is more than enough for elevated recurrence rates to emerge during the examined 3-year window, and such elevated rates did occur for the single-episode complicated cases but not for the uncomplicated cases at the same 9-year average time since the baseline episode. Our recent replication and extension 3 of our earlier results 1 supports the predictive validity of the uncomplicated versus complicated depression distinction across stressors, supplementing a previous study supporting concurrent validity 7. A course with elevated recurrence relative to population baselines is generally considered the single most salient identifying feature of depressive disorder versus normal sadness 8 and a primary rationale for inferring underlying dysfunction 9, yet no such elevation occurs for uncomplicated depression. The evidence thus supports two conclusions. First, uncomplicated depression is not similar to, and is typologically distinct from, major depressive disorder. Second, given the lack of differences between uncomplicated depression and no history of MDD in crucial negative sequelae including recurrence, suicide attempt, and GAD, uncomplicated depression is best interpreted as an intense normal emotional episode. The additional analyses presented here in response to Maj's 5 concerns regarding quality of recovery and duration of follow-up substantially strengthen the support for these conclusions. Jerome C.

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is a major feature of the illness. Like many of the other aspects of the illness, however, it has not been studied extensively in older patients. Several studies of older patients with a lifetime course of poor outcome and chronic institutional stay have indicated that some patients manifest evidence of profound cognitive impairments on a cross-sectional basis and cognitive and functional decline over longitudinal follow-ups of 30 months or longer. Risk factors for this decline include lower educational attainment and more severe positive symptoms, but do not include more severe symptoms of physical illness. These impairments have been shown to be discriminable from normal age-related changes and from the changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In contrast, studies of patients with no history of lifetime institutional stay find no such evidence of either age-related changes in cognitive functioning or longitudinal decline in cognitive or functional status. Since there is accumulating evidence of progressive brain changes over the lifespan in patients with schizophrenia, the course of cognitive deficits in later life will remain an important topic, both for understanding the lifetime course of schizophrenia and for developing interventions aimed at reduction of disability in the illness.",

In children, dysthymia may present as irritable mood, and a duration of symptoms of only one year is required to make the diagnosis. By definition, there is no history of a major depressive disorder. Associated symptoms include poor appetite or overeating, insomnia or hypersomnia, poor concentration or difficulty making decisions, low energy, low self-esteem and feelings of hopelessness. Because of the chronic nature of this disorder, treatment requires an understanding approach and continuity of care.",

      "abstract": "Enuresis is defined as the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months in a child who is at least 5 years of age. The behavior is not due exclusively to the direct physiologic effect of a substance or a general medical condition. Diurnal enuresis defines wetting, whereas awake and nocturnal enuresis refers to voiding during sleep. Primary enuresis occurs in children who have never been consistently dry through the night, whereas secondary enuresis refers the resumption of wetting after at least 6 months of dryness. Monosymptomatic enuresis has no associated daytime symptoms, and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, which is more common, often has at least one subtle daytime symptom. Monosymptomatic enuresis is rarely associated with significant organic underlying abnormalities. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disabling illness characterized by repetitive, ritualistic behaviors over which the patients have little or no control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between OCD and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE).In this case-control study, we evaluated 186 children aged 6-17 years old who were visited in the pediatric clinics of Amir Kabir Hospital, Arak, Iran. The control group included 93 healthy children, and the case group included 93 age- and sex-matched children with stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Then, the children's behavioral status was evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.The difference in compulsion was significant (P = 0.021), whereas the difference in obsession was significant between the two groups (P = 0.013). The most common symptom in CKD children with compulsion was silent repetition of words.Compulsive and obsessive are more common in NMNE versus healthy children. The observed correlation between compulsive-obsessive and NMNE makes psychological counseling mandatory in children with NMNE.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "title": "Los trastornos de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia",
      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

      "title": "Mania Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition in the brain. A 29-year-old housewife with secondary mania related to multiple sclerosis is described. The case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in treating patients with mania, especially when there are unexplained neurological findings and cognitive dysfunction. The case also illustrates the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for investigating organic causes of secondary mania and psychosis. Key words: Bipolar disorder, Case report, Diagnosis, Magnetic resonance imaging, Multiple sclerosis Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode according to DSM-IV requires a distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 4 days, with at least 3 associated symptoms, such as inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. Very often, the florid psychopathology can obscure subtle neurological/physical signs and symptoms, and make the diagnosis of the underlying organic conditions difficult. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a particularly devastating disease of the central nervous system (CNS); a patient's presenting symptoms and the temporal evolution of the clinical findings may suggest the correct diagnosis. In relapsing-remitting MS--the type present in 80% of patients--symptoms and signs typically evolve over a period of several days, stabilise, and then often improve, spontaneously or with treatment, within weeks. Relapsing-remitting MS has a peak age of onset of 20 to 40 years and has a female predominance of approximately 2:1. This type of MS typically starts with sensory disturbances, unilateral optic neuritis, diplopia, limb weakness, clumsiness, gait apraxia, and neurogenic bladder and bowel symptoms. Twenty percent of affected patients have primary progressive MS, while others may develop persistent neurological signs after relapse and the disease may progress between relapses (secondary progressive MS). Prominent cortical signs (aphasia, apraxia, recurrent seizures, visual field loss, and early dementia) and extrapyramidal phenomena (chorea and rigidity) only rarely dominate the clinical picture. Eventually, cognitive impairment, depression, emotional lability, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, progressive quadriparesis, and other CNS manifestations become troublesome. The diagnosis is based on established clinical, and when necessary, laboratory criteria. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are Poser's criteria. (1) Very recently, a new criterion developed by McDonald has been found to enable earlier diagnosis in a group of patients with one demyelinating syndrome. (2) It may become widely used in the near future. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), findings of multifocal lesions of various ages, especially those involving the periventricular white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and the spinal cord white matter, support the clinical impression. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI indicates current sites of presumed inflammatory demyelination (active lesions). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often shows increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins of restricted specificity, oligoclonal bands may be present, or the synthesis of immunogobulin G (IgG) may be increased. Physiological evidence of subclinical dysfunction of optic nerves and spinal cord (changes in visual evoked responses and somatosensory evoked potentials) may further support the diagnosis. A case of a 29-year-old married woman with secondary hypomanic features associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented, along with a review of the subject. …",

According to DSM‐5 , a diagnosis of pica requires symptoms to occur, at minimum, for a 1‐month period. Pica behaviors are inappropriate to the individual's developmental level and not part of a social or cultural practice. When the symptoms occur within the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, a diagnosis of pica is made only if the eating behaviors require clinical attention or significantly interrupt social functioning. Pica can be dangerous, depending on the amounts and types of substances consumed and the degree of nutritional deficiency that may be present. Although pica is an old illness, little is known about its prevalence and course because it has not been formally studied in high‐risk populations, and treatment is difficult to assess.",

No one is likely to mistake the signs of advanced dementia, but there is always difficulty deciding at what point someone who has been showing gradually worsening memory can be diagnosed as having definite dementia. A definition of dementia ... No reliable scanning technique or laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis, which is down to the individual judgement of a clinician. Tests can help ( Chapter 2), and there are operational criteria for mild, moderate and severe dementia ( Box 1.2), but the earlier the diagnosis of dementia is made, the more uncertain it will be. WHO criteria require symptoms to be present for at least 6 months, and specify that the impairment is ‘sufficient to interfere with everyday activities’, but people vary greatly in the level of activity they undertake and their ability to cope with declining memory.",

      "title": "Attention deficit and hyperkinetic disorders in childhood and adolescence",
      "abstract": "Abstract The concept of ADHD arose from neurological formulations, but does not entail them, and the modern definition simply describes a set of behavioural traits. The historical evolution of the concept was described by Schachar. It began with the idea that some behavioural problems in children arose, not from social and familial adversity, but from subtle changes in brain development. The term ‘minimal brain dysfunction (MBD)’ was often applied, and covered not only disorganized and disruptive behaviour but other developmental problems (such as dyspraxias and language delays) presumed to have an unknown physical cause. MBD, however, stopped being a useful description when studies of children with definite and more-than-minimal brain damage made it plain that they showed a very wide range of psychological impairment, not a characteristic pattern (see Harris, this volume); and therefore it was invalid to infer the presence of brain disorder from the nature of the psychological presentation. The successor to the concept of MBD was attention deficit and hyperactivity: defined, observable behaviour traits without assumption of cause. ‘Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder’ (ADHD) in DSM-IV, and ‘Hyperkinetic Disorder’ in ICD-10, describe a constellation of overactivity, impulsivity and inattentiveness. These core problems often coexist with other difficulties of learning, behaviour or mental life, and the coexistent problems may dominate the presentation. This coexistence, to the psychopathologist, emphasizes the multifaceted nature of the disorder; to the sociologist, a doubt about whether it should be seen as a disorder at all; to the developmentalist, the shifting and context-dependent nature of childhood traits. For clinicians, ADHD symptoms usually need to be disentangled from a complex web of problems. It is worthwhile to do so because of the strong developmental impact of ADHD and the existence of effective treatments. Public controversy continues, but professional practice in most countries makes ADHD one of the most commonly diagnosed problems of child mental health.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history.

RESUMEN Se ha estudiado la mortalidad y la evolución été los estados neurológico y mental en niños été 28 dias a un ano été edad con convulsiones afebriles no debidas a insulto postnatal. Los casos fueron divididos en 4 tipos été ataques: espasmos infantiles, estatus epilepticus, y “otros” generalizados o parciales (enfermos sin espasmos o status). Durante más été un ano se estudié la mortalidad en 334 casos y el pronéstico mental y neurologico en 313 ninos. El pronostico global fué muy pobre incluso en los casos sin espasmos infantiles. La mortalidad fue más alta y las secuelas neurológicas m^s comunes en los casos sintomaticos que en los criptogenicos. La más alta mortalidad y el mayor niimero été defectos neurolbgicos se encontraron en los status epilepticus y en el grupo été“otros” ataques parciales. Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%). La evolu‐ción menos sombria se observo en el grupo criptogenico été“otros” ataques generalizados con historia familiar positiva. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen.

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

This is at least partially explained by the overlap between symptoms of depression and symptoms of AD. Recent studies using latent class analysis provided clarification to this diagnostic dilemma. All nine DSM-IV symptoms of major depression were found to characterize a class with a high chance (96%) of having a clinical diagnosis of major depression, and symptoms of anxiety were also frequent. Other psychiatric symptoms may also be included under the construct of depression in AD, since both apathy and anxiety are among the most frequent comorbid conditions for major depression in AD. Subtypes of depression should also be validated in this condition. For instance, increased awareness of cognitive and functional deficits is significantly associated with dysthymia but not with major depression, suggesting that different depressive syndromes in AD may have different etiology.",

      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders according to DSM V, like all other psychiatric disorders, are still based\r\n on the description and grouping of symptoms. The emotional state can change in two\r\n directions: an elevated mood (which can oscillate from hypomania to mania) and lower\r\n mood (depression). For diagnosing mood disorder, it is essential to have a more\r\n comprehensive diagnostic formulation. The role plays careful observation and identifying\r\n the symptoms, which are used as the most important method for diagnosing mood\r\n disorders. There must be diagnostic criteria for each disease to determine the spectrum of\r\n symptoms occurring in the disease, but it is also important that there are minimal\r\n symptoms when deciding which diagnosis will be given to the patient. In the patient\r\n besides the main mental problem, the appearance of other illnesses, such as the\r\n circumstances that have arisen in the patient's life, and in the working and social\r\n environment, must be considered. We set the mood disorder diagnosis based on anamnesis,\r\n clinical picture, and course of the disease. In basic symptoms of depression, there is a loss\r\n of interest in, until then, important things and activities. The disturbances must last at least\r\n two weeks in order to be a depressive episode. Along with the symptoms that are\r\n compulsory, there are also symptoms such as loss of energy, appetite, sense of worth and /\r\n or guilt, deconcentration, helplessness, indecision, and suicidal thoughts until attempted\r\n suicide. Patients can become so frozen that they can not show the usual emotions, such as\r\n sorrow, joy or pleasure, or they may feel that the world around them without color and life\r\n is dead. The main symptoms that characterize mania are elevated mood, increased energy\r\n and activity. These patients experience graceful ideas, they think they have tremendous\r\n power, they think they can change the whole world. One of the picture of the disease that\r\n can occur in manic patients is the appearance of interpersonal conflicts, which can lead to\r\n paranoid treatment of reality. Pharmacological and psychological therapy gives the best\r\n results, and it is important to emphasize to the patient and family that the therapy does not\r\n have immediate effect, but that the therapy should take about two to six weeks for the drug\r\n / drugs to take effect. The patient should be monitored permanently and analyzed the\r\n results achieved. If the desired results have not been reached, it is necessary to change the\r\n approach and therapy.",

      "title": "Minor Depression and 'Subthreshold' Anxiety Symptoms in Older Adults: Psychosocial Therapies and Special Considerations",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS A new focus on these common causes of distress and impairment. In recent years more attention has been given to identifying and treating mental disorders in older adults. By and large, these efforts have focused on disorders delineated in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Sta/Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). However, another class of disorders is also beginning to receive attention: mental disorders. Although these sets of symptoms do not meet the full criteria to be classified as specific mental disorders, they are nonetheless associated with clinically significant distress or impairment (Pincus, Davis, and McQueen,1999). In this article we will discuss two specific conditions, and subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder, and the evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial therapies for these conditions for older adults. MINOR DEPRESSION Minor depression is typically defined as the presence of at least two but fewer than five depressive symptoms, including depressed mood or loss of interest in normal daily activities, during the same two-week period with no history of major depressive episode or dysthymic disorder but with clinically significant impairment or distress (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Minor depression is highly prevalent in older adults in the community (9.9 percent) (Hybels, Blazer, and Pieper, 2001) and in primary care (5.2 percent) (Lyness et al., 1999). In mixed-age samples minor depression has been shown to be associated with levels of functional impairment comparable to those caused by medical illnesses (Wells et al., 1992) and with increased expenditures on medical care (Johnson, Weissman, and Klerman, 1992). Morbidity has been less extensively studied in samples of older adults, but the morbidity rates of elders with minor depression may be assumed to be at least comparable to samples with medical illnesses given the higher prevalence of complicating medical conditions. A recent study has shown minor depression to be associated with an increased risk for mortality in older men (Penninx et al., 1999). Although assessment of the prevalence of minor depression in racial and ethnic minority populations tends to be clouded by linguistic and cultural differences in expressing affective and somatic symptoms, recent research taking into account these measurement challenges indicates that minor depression is very common in older ethnic minorities in primary care. According to Arean and Alvidrez (2001), as many as io percent of older African Americans, 15 percent of older Latinos, and 12 percent of older Asians meet criteria for minor depression. SCREENING FOR MINOR DEPRESSION One of the most common instruments for screening and tracking depression in primary care is the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-- Item Depression Module (PHQ-9). The patient fills out the questionnaire, and the information can yield a diagnosis of major or minor depression. While psychometric studies have yet to be done on the utility of the PHQ-9 with minority elders, the instrument is available in Spanish and Chinese. PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPIES FOR MINOR DEPRESSION Empirically derived treatment guidelines have been established for major depression. However, a paucity of studies, which have yielded conflicting findings, means that no specific guidelines are currently available for pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment of minor depression. Psychosocial therapies are particularly appealing for older adults because they often have medical conditions as well, leading to an increased possibility of adverse drug interactions. Since the research on treating minor depression in older adults is so limited, we will review the evidence for psychosocial treatments of minor depression in both younger and older adults together. The interventions examined include cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and problem-solving therapy, as well as physical exercise. …",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

Namun\r\ndemikian, gangguan mood dapat\r\njuga terjadi berdasarkan pencetusnya\r\nmisalnya gangguan mood\r\nkarena pemakaian zat dan gangguan\r\nmood yang terjadi karena faktor penyakit medis atau\r\nfisik.\r\nDalam keadaan alamiah/normal, suasana\r\nperasaan dalam diri dapat berfluktuasi, namun bila\r\nfluktuasinya ringan dan sesaat maka tak mengganggu.\r\nNamun bila berfluktuasi lebih tinggi dan lebih sering\r\nserta menetap, maka akan berdampak pada diri dan\r\nperilaku serta perkataan, hingga dapat menimbulkan ketidaknyamanan serta relasi yang berkonflik dengan siapa saja.\r\nBila ini terjadi, maka dapat merupakan tanda dan gejala dari\r\nGangguan Mood.",

      "abstract": "Dysthymic disorder, an insidious and chronic depressive mood disorder that waxes and wanes in intensity over several years, is fairly prevalent in healthcare settings. Although the explicit etiology is unknown, serotonergic dysfunction may be involved. Dysthymia appears to have a high rate of comorbidity, including both psychiatric and medical disorders. The primary care physician should maintain an awareness of this mood disorder, be able to screen efficiently for signs and symptoms, and be able to differentiate major depression from dysthymia. The foundation of treatment is pharmacotherapy, in particular with serotonergic antidepressants, although response is moderate at best. Antidepressants are initiated at low doses and drug trials are conducted for 3-month periods if not precluded by side effects. When reasonably effective, antidepressants should be continued for 2 to 3 years or more. Adjunctive interventions in the treatment of dysthymia are based on comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions. Although dysthymia is an insidious, difficult-to-treat disorder, intervention is worthwhile. Further research may elucidate more effective interventions for this challenging disorder.",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses.

The diagnosis, usually easy, may be beset with several traps: alcoholism may be unrecognized, or a diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome may be wrongly made, or again a complication may be either overlooked or erroneously suspected. An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.",

      "abstract": "At present there is no consensus on defining “Recovery” in schizophrenia,while there is an accepted definition of “Remission”. Remission model considers “stability” the treatment primary goal and, once achieved, focus is on mainteining stability and preventing relapse. This model reflects a condition where are absent prominent symptoms but may be present some mild symptoms of schizophrenia, retaining not realistic absence of any symptoms. It would require treating an acute psychotic episode,then there still may be a range of no detectable or persistent and disabling symptoms:remission and level of functioning are related but not the same. Some patients could have good level of functioning despite persistent symptoms and others could meet remission criteria despite considerable impairments. Remission is an obteinable outcome for many psychotic outpatients:the point of departure between manteinance and recovery-oriented model happens only after “stability” is achieved;no one could recover in face of repeated crisis,hospitalisation or unrelenting psychotic symptoms. Unfortunately two causes have resulted in a relative neglect of the concept of recovery from psychotic illness:the divide between mainstream biologically oriented psychiatry and the psychiatric rehabilitation movement;the misunderstanding fact that term “recovery movement” is sometimes construed as anti-medication or anti-psychiatry orientation. Irrefuteble point is that recovery model not rejects the importance of remission:stability and relapse prevention. The recovery model besides asserts that achieving remission is the beginning and not the end of treatment plan:then there will be continued efforts to work with patient,family,caregiver,to continue to achieve further improvements in life goals. The “Recovery” patient-centred model have to be embraced as prymary goal by mainstream organizations and services in Mental Health.",

This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters.

The WHO tries to achieve homogeneity on the one hand by using similar exclusion criteria like those of DSM-IV (time factor, organic cause, etc.), but on the other by defining subgroups (see p. 7ff). The first way, the time factor, however, applied by the WHO is somewhat more complicated than that of the APA. The first time factor used by the WHO concerns the development of symptoms (the time-interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks). And the second factor, the duration of an episode, depends on the type of the subgroup: the total duration of the disorder in the subgroups with schizophrenic symptoms (F23.1: Acute Polymorphic Psychotic Disorders with Symptoms of Schizophrenia, F23.2: Acute Schizophrenia-like Psychotic Disorders) must not exceed 1 month. This is also valid for the unspecified type (F23.8).",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

There is substantial evidence that 'frontal lobe' or 'executive' dysfunction is the setting in which spontaneous confabulations arise, and that schizophrenic patients show impairments on 'frontal lobe' and memory tasks. A neuropsychological case-study was conducted in a patient with prominent delusional memories, secondary to De Clérambault's syndrome ('erotomania') and schizophrenia. The patient showed a moderate degree of anterograde memory impairment, relative to her high verbal IQ. She showed a 'dip' in her retrograde memory test performance for the period around the onset of her psychosis, but otherwise retrograde memory was intact. Performance at 'frontal lobe' or 'executive' tasks was completely intact. In summary, frontal lobe (or executive) dysfunction does not appear to have contributed to this patient's delusional memory, although she did show a moderate degree of anterograde memory impairment, consistent with other studies of schizophrenic patients. Possible differences in the underlying nature of delusional memory and spontaneous confabulation are discussed.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

      "abstract": "Manic-depressive illness is recently named as a mood disorder according to the ICD-10 or DSM-III R diagnostic criteria. It consists of two opposite states, manic state and depressive state. Typical manic symptoms include a pathologic delightful mood, flight of ideas, heightened level of activity and sexual interest. Grandiosity, rapid and pressured speech, increased energy and decreased need for sleep are also frequently seen. On the other hand, depressive symptoms are characterized by prolonged depressive mood, inhibition of thought, lowered level of activity, depressive ideas or delusions and various somatic dysfunctions such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance. Mood disorders are often seen in association with organic brain diseases, collagen diseases such as SLE, some endocrinological diseases and medication. Diagnosis of manic or depressive states is usually carried out by careful psychiatric interviews. No specific somatic symptoms or signs have been identified for manic-depressive illness. Many rating scales, for instance Zung's SDS or HDSR, have been utilized as diagnostic aids. Rating scales and the symptomatology and diagnosis of manic-depressive illness are described in general.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals.

It is unclear whether children that develop the syndrome had entirely normal cognitive skills before seizure onset, since subtle impairment easily escapes recognition in small infants. It is also difficult to demonstrate whether a recognisable profile of cognitive impairment or a definite behavioural phenotype exists. No clear‐cut imaging or neuropathological marker or substrate has been recognised for cognitive impairment in this syndrome. However, there are different potentially causative factors, including the specific effects on the Nav1.1 channels caused by the underlying genic or genomic defect; frequent and prolonged convulsive and non‐convulsive seizures or status epilepticus; recurrent subtle ictal phenomena, such as that accompanying pronounced visual sensitivity; the use of antiepileptic drugs with cognitive side effects, especially in heavy multiple‐drug therapy; and the restrictions that children with severe epilepsy inevitably undergo.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background : Miller Fisher Syndrome usually presents with complete ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia. We present an unusual case which presented with unilateral abducens nerve palsy. Case presentation : A 51 year old female patient presented with a history of difficulty in walking and double vision for 1 week which started 2 weeks following an episode of acute gastroenteritis. She didn’t have any bladder bowel incontinence or difficulty in breathing. On examination there was left side abducens nerve palsy and bilateral significant dysmetria. Upper limb and lower limb power was 4/5 with global areflexia. There was no fatigability or sensory deficit. Higher cortical functions were intact with Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Brain stem cerebro vascular accident, alcohol, toxin or drug mediated disease, myasthenia gravis, Bickerstaff encephalitis and Miller-Fisher syndrome were considered as possible differential diagnosis. There was no history of alcohol consumption or any exposure to drugs or toxins. Her Non contrast brain and MRI brain were normal. Nerve conduction study showed asymmetrical sensory motor and F wave abnormalities consistent with a Guillen-Barre Sydrome variant. Cerebro Spinal Fluid analysis showed albumino-cytological dissociation. These findings suggested the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher Syndrome. She was started on plasmaphareis. Her vital parameters, vital capacity and neurological deficit were closely monitored. With 5 cycles of plasmapharesis she made a complete neurological recovery and she was discharged on 16th day of admission. Conclusion: Miller Fisher Syndrome can present as unilateral abducens nerve palsy and early diagnosis and treatment leads to excellent functional outcome.",

      "title": "Depression and Mania in Patients with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary: Depression has a major impact on quality of life in patients with epilepsy and is also the main risk factor for the increased suicide rate in epilepsy. The frequency of depressive disorders depends on the severity of epilepsy and the localization of the epileptogenic focus, with a prevalence of ≤50% in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The diagnosis of depression in epilepsy may be difficult because symptoms of depression may be fluctuating, and some symptoms, such as memory complaints, may be misinterpreted as being a consequence of drug treatment or the epilepsy per se. Affective disorders in epilepsy may differ from those seen in patients without epilepsy. A possibility exists that patients with epilepsy will develop a specific interictal dysphoric syndrome related to limbic system dysfunction. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest a bidirectional relation between depression and epilepsy. Depression does not necessarily occur after the onset of epilepsy; the sequence may as well be the other way round, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for both disorders. Classic bipolar disorder type I is rarely seen in epilepsy, and manic episodes occur almost exclusively in the setting of postictal psychosis or after epilepsy surgery. This article explores the clinical manifestations of depressive and manic disorders in epilepsy and the differences from bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a combination of disturbed motor functioning and changes in thought, mood and vigilance. Two patterns - one consisting in catalepsy, posturing, mutism and negativism and a second consisting of echophenomenon, automatic obedience, verbigeration, and other stereotypies - have been abstracted. Catatonia has been associated with psychiatric disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for example - as well as secondary to various underlying medical conditions.It will be described a case report of a 55 years old woman with prior psychiatric history of hospitalization with an unspecified nonorganic psychosis (F29-ICD10), presenting features of catatonia - immobility with fixed posture and gaze (sometimes presenting posturing), an almost absence of spontaneous movements and speech, echophenomenon (echolalia, palilalia, coprolalia) erupting in a otherwise mute state and showing, on occasions, periods of purposelessness motor excitement and restlessness, verbigeration and screaming with a grim of terror. She was disoriented and performed poorly on the MMSE. No neurologic focal signs were disclosed other than prominent primitive reflexes. Prior to admission, her family reported a sudden mood change: she became irritable, argumentative, with delusional thought content of persecutory nature, grandiose ideas. Viral and immune-mediated encephalitis were discharged. The MRI scan showed a right temporal medial lesion (amygdala atrophy). It will be addressed the hypothetical relationship between the dramatic clinical presentation and the cerebral lesion, grounded on the scientific research regarding limbic encephalitis, catatonic symptoms and neurophysiology. It will also be underscored the clinical relevance of differentiated psychopathology of catatonia.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) is a severely under-studied mental disorder, regardless of being relatively as prevalent as other serious mental illnesses (SMI) to the general population, such as schizophrenia and obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the nature of the current body of work on the disorder, it's clear there is a need for further research, as there are only a few small scale studies that approach the contradistinction in symptomatology between varying onset triggers. This paper proposes an investigation into whether there is a distinction in severity, duration, and persistence of symptoms between individuals with DPDR triggered by drugs versus non-drug induced cases. The proposed study hypothesizes that symptoms in drug induced individuals will be significantly different from cases induced by other triggers. The outcome of symptoms may depend on many factors, a few such as whether or not an individual continues to experiment with drugs following the development of DPDR, running the risk of re-exposing themselves to a severe episode, whether or not symptoms rooted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) retrigger dissociative episodes, and the potential of co-occurring hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) causing symptoms of perceptual disturbances. The proposed study will use a survey design to collect data from 175 participants, targeting individuals who are currently experiencing DPDR or DPDR-like symptoms, or have recovered from the disorder. Given that significant evidence of distinction is uncovered, this study may be the stepping stone to addressing and developing treatment options for DPDR sufferers in the future.",

      "abstract": "The Landau-Kleffner syndrome consists in the association of an aphasia acquired during childhood or adolescence after a period of normal development, accompanied by epileptic fits and, sometimes, psychological disturbances. The appearance of the symptoms may not be simultaneous. The nature of this syndrome has been widely discussed and even the possibility of being a non-unitary syndrome has been considered. It may be possibly due to diverse etiologies, genetic or acquired (infectious). The relation between the aphasic, the psychologic and the convulsive symptoms has also raised controversies. A case of a female is described in which the psychological symptomatology was so severe, she had to be admitted in a psychiatric unit. The symptoms consisted in agitation during the night and severe persistent insomnia so as difficulties for relationship during day. No abnormalities were detected in a TAC nor in a RM but electroencephalographic and neuropsychological abnormalities were detected. The epileptic fits disappeared with a carbamacepine treatment but the rest of symptoms remained even more accentuated. After her admission, a treatment with valproate achieved to control her fits and the aphasic symptoms and neuropsychological deficits were compensated in the course of several months. After a year of treatment the patient's life was normalized, she resumed her studies, the EEG abnormalities disappeared so as the psychological disturbances and the behavior problems with the exception of phobic symptoms, similar to the ones of other family members. The patient has a history of epilepsy on its mother's side. The evolution and treatment response suggests that at least in some cases of the Landau-Kleffner syndrome, the etiology of the aphasia and other neuropsychological deficits and of the behavior disorders are related with some subclinical epileptic discharges and with a \"functional inhibition\" of some areas of the nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review To review the conceptual problems in distinguishing between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome, for both may present with fatigue as the main symptom. Recent findings The differences and/or similarities between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome have not been studied, conceptually or empirically. The literature fails to present discriminant validity of chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to undifferentiated somatoform disorder. A critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder but absent from the definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome: some patients experience their fatigue as being exclusively physical and not as mental, which is prima facie peculiar, for fatigue is necessarily a mental experience. One is not able to experience fatigue without a mind (or a brain). This experience is characterized as a ‘mindless’ fatigue, underpinned by pathological reductionist thinking. By not recognizing this critical feature, diagnostic endeavours may perpetuate the problem as a function of the patient's difficulty. Summary Proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome should distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome from undifferentiated somatoform disorder, if chronic fatigue syndrome is a distinct entity at all. Further, the ‘mindless’ quality is a critical feature that needs consideration in refining the concept of undifferentiated somatoform disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Numerous psychopathological syndromes have been attributed to posttraumatic stress, both at the time of the trauma and many years later. To date, however, there is little literature on pseudodementia as a delayed traumatic stress response. The authors present a case history of a 50‐year‐old woman who developed severe cognitive impairment following retrieval of previously forgotten memories of childhood sexual abuse. Her cognitive condition deteriorated rapidly and dramatically. Neuropsychological assessment and clinical presentation led to a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (vs. corticobasal degeneration). Detailed neurologic and medical evaluations could not identify any underlying physical cause. Her condition progressively worsened over 9 months, at which point memantine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist, was begun. The patient regained full functioning over the next year. Although an organic cause could not be ruled out, it was likely that recovery of traumatic memories was contributory to the patient's condition, as ongoing psychotherapy had begun 1 year into the course. If additional cases with similar presentations are reported, such cases would corroborate the notion that persistent, severe, and reversible cognitive impairment constitutes a previously unrecognized and atypical posttraumatic response.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

Bipolar disorder is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania or hypomania and depressive episodes; rapid cycling, mixed states, and psychotic symptoms occur in some cases. Depression is a serious mental disorder that manifests with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. Mania is the opposite of depression; it is a state of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, arousal, and/or energy levels.

      "abstract": "El trastorno depresivo mayor es un desorden heterogéneo y multifactorial caracterizado por episodios de al menos dos semanas de duración, en los cuales se presente al menos uno de los dos síntomas centrales. Estos son: 1.- Estado de ánimo depresivo con pérdida de interés por las actividades cotidianas y 2.- Ausencia de la capacidad de sentir placer (anhedonia). Estos síntomas traen consigo trastornos anímicos, cognitivos y fisiológicos y en los casos más severos, pueden asociarse a conductas suicidas. Si bien en la actualidad la etiología del trastorno depresivo mayor es poco conocida, se ha reportado que tanto la presencia de neuroinflamación como la reducción de la neurogénesis hipocampal adulta son eventos claves en el desarrollo de esta patología. Las terapias actuales para el trastorno depresivo mayor no están enfocadas en estas alteraciones, lo que podría explicar el alto porcentaje de refractariedad al tratamiento de pacientes con trastorno depresivo mayor frente a la terapia convencional. Por este motivo, se ha propuesto como una opción de tratamiento el uso de células madre mesenquimáticas (MSC), las cuales son capaces de producir de manera paracrina, una gran variedad de moléculas terapéuticas entre las que se encuentran moléculas anti-inflamatorias y factores neuroprotectores inductores de la neurogénesis. Estas moléculas secretadas por las MSC se pueden recuperar desde el medio de cultivo celular y en conjunto reciben el nombre de secretoma. Este trabajo se basó en la evaluación del potencial antidepresivo de la administración intranasal repetida de secretoma derivado de MSC en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor instaurado en el bioterio de la Universidad del Desarrollo. En conjunto, los datos obtenidos muestran que el tratamiento intranasal con secretoma derivado de MSC fue capaz de revertir algunas de las conductas asociadas a estados depresivos en animales, disminuyendo significativamente el puntaje global de depresión en comparación a los animales tratados con vehículo. A nivel estructural el modelo animal de depresión utilizado no mostró presencia de alteraciones del proceso de neurogenesis hipocampal adulta pero sí mostró neuroinflamación, evidenciada en un aumento de la densidad de astrocitos a nivel del hipocampo en comparación a los animales control. Este aumento no se observó en los animales tratados con secretoma intranasal, sugiriendo un efecto anti-inflamatorio del biofármaco. Adicionalmente, se observó que el secretoma derivado de MSC ejerció un efecto protector sobre los astrocitos inhibiendo el proceso de atrofia de sus prolongaciones. Los datos pre-clínicos obtenidos sugieren que la administración intranasal de secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas representa un tratamiento potencialmente eficaz para reducir los síntomas de depresión en humanos y una posible alternativa terapéutica a los tratamientos actuales para esta devastadora patología",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is an impossible concept. Under this heading, a number of psychoses is being grouped which have the common characteristic that the patient is, as a rule, but by no means always, fully conscious. In all other respects, no other points agree, neither in respect of symptoms, nor in respect of etiology or prognosis. Hence, there are hardly any reasons to reduce these disease patterns to a common denominator, either as \"schizophrenia\" or as a \"group of schizophrenic psychoses\". Rather, it seems more probable that schizophrenic psychoses are individual disease patterns, instead of being variations of a basic type. What is principally needed at this stage, is a fair amount of empirical research to catalog the concept of schizophrenia. Such a catalog would have to be based on exactly defined and described syndromes to enable further study whether there are any other points besides these symptoms which characterize the syndrome in question, such as etiology, pathogenetic factors, course, or response treatment. The more characteristics are found, the greater the chance that the disease pattern under investigation is really a unit by itself. In the course of these studies, and in order to avoid terminological confusion, it is advisable to use, for the time being, the term \"schizophrenic psychoses\", under the condition that in each concrete case this term must be supplemented by a careful typification of the symptomatology, of the etiologic factors, and of the course of the disease.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

Sometimes included as paranoid schizophrenia and in many other cases as other persistent delusional disorders, its diagnosis is out of the current code list, such as ICD or DSM. Nevertheless it has unique peculiarities, already objectified by Krapelin. Objectives Claiming the concept of paraphrenia as a clinical entity with its own phenomenological characteristics included in chronic psychotic disorders. Aims To keep in mind classic psychopathology, not included in current code list, such as ICD and DSM. Methods A 40-year-old woman with good premorbid adaptation, no previous history of mental disorder. Her first psychotic symptoms appeared at 30, not because drug effect. Father diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Among her first internment, her mood was persistently elevated, expansive and easily irritable. She had bizarre megalomaniac delusions of grandeur, which combined with erotomanic ideas felt as ego-syntonic, supported by auditive hallucinations. There were no other symptoms found in manic episodes in previous historical of affective descompensations. Results Antipsychotics only had effect in mood, which turned euthymic. Active psychoticism has continually been present for 10 years although different treatment. No major affective descompensations has taken place among this period. Cognitively conserved, without defectual symptoms, is currently working in supported employment. Conclusions Clinical symptoms of paraphrenia lyed between schizophrenia and persistent delusional disorders. Specifically in this case we had to do the differential diagnosis with bipolar disorder, which was ruled out attending to the longitudinal course.",

      "title": "On the Mechanism of Mental Processes, with Special Reference to Emotional Control",
      "abstract": "Some psychiatrists attribute great importance to the neuro-insane diathesis as a factor in the causation of insanity, whilst others belittle its influence. The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

This chapter therefore refers to the disorder by its older, but more accurate, name. Although the diagnosis of manic depressive disorder is made on the basis of phenomenology, there are several reasons to conduct a thorough medical history and physical examination. First, there are general medical or substance-related causes of mania and depression that, if treated, may lead to the resolution of the mood episode. Second, medical evaluation is necessary before starting several types of medications used in the treatment of manic depressive disorder. Manic depressive disorder has its onset in most persons in adolescence and young adulthood, between the ages of 15 and 30. Type II bipolar disorder is characterized by having the patient experience a hypomanic episode and episodes of major depression, but no full manic episodes.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic reactions in the context of meditation and esoteric practices have been described in the psychiatric literature. In most cases, these psychotic conditions are transient and do not lead to functional impairment. The authors present the case of a 46-year-old woman who had worked as a spiritual healer for several years and, in the course of this occupation, increasingly developed a highly specific configuration of psychotic symptoms (all of which could be convincingly traced back to the formerly used spiritual techniques) along with depressive symptoms and severe functional impairment. The differential diagnosis was initially complicated by the relative conformity of the patient’s psychotic symptoms with her occupational practices and the absence of other, more typical, symptoms of schizophrenia. Only a thorough anamnesis with another spiritual healer and precise identification of psychopathology helped to disentangle the merely uncommon from the pathologic features of this case. Possible mechanisms of psychotogenesis are discussed in light of the literature and the specific features of the presented case. Although a single case report cannot prove a causal link between spiritual healing and development of psychosis, the patient’s specific psychopathology, with preeminently disturbed self-experience, and its consistency with the patient’s spiritual practices suggest at least a contributory role in this case.",

The delusions were more common in women, in patients with a history of psychiatric illness, and amongst those with higher information subscores (Blessed Scale); and were less common in patients suffering from apraxia or severe psychosocial incompetence. Amongst the deluded patients the simultaneous presence of disorientation, hallucinations and hyperactivity often signified the diagnosis of delirium, but on follow up it was not correlated with death within 18 months. The same symptoms in the non‐deluded patients were correlated with severe social incompetence and death within 18 months. It is concluded that the presence of delusions in subjects over 75 years old suffering from dementia is related, to certain extent, to previous or concomitant psychiatric illness, and that it reflects a relative preservation of mental function amongst those without such history.",

Qui ne s’est jamais senti anxieux face la survenue d’un evenement important, qui ne s’est jamais plaint d’etre deprime certains jours maussades ? Pourtant, l’anxiete comme la depression peuvent donner lieu a des troubles psychiatriques majeurs, associes a d’importantes perturbations cognitives. Ces perturbations ont ete mises en evidence voici deja de nombreuses annees. La depression, en particulier, entraine chez le patient de reelles difficultes psycho-motrices, se manifestant notamment par un ralentissement general ainsi que des troubles mnesiques, attentionnels, et executifs. Ces alterations ont pu etre associees a differentes modifications du cerveau meme, attestant de bouleversements profonds de la structure cerebrale et des connexions neuronales, a la source ou consecutives a l’etat depressif. Outre ces perturbations que nous qualifierons de cognitives, des difficultes du traitement emotionnel ont egalement ete demontrees. Plus specifiquement, les patients depressifs semblent manifester un biais lorsqu’ils doivent analyser du materiel emotionnel. Ce biais est decrit comme un traitement affecte (dans le sens d’une facilitation ou au contraire d’un ralentissement) de tout contenu a valence emotionnel, comprenant par exemple des mots a valence emotionnelle (designant des emotions, des sentiments), des textes ou scenario, des scenes visuelles ou des visages. Dans ce chapitre, nous tenterons de synthetiser les principaux apports de la psychopathologie cognitive a l’etude de ces deux grands syndromes que sont la depression et les troubles anxieux. En nous centrant sur le theme des expressions faciales emotionnelles, nous passerons en revue les principales donnees comportementales obtenues a travers de paradigmes classiques, et nous montrerons comment les etudes utilisant l’imagerie ou l’electrophysiologie ont utilise ces paradigmes pour mettre en lumiere le fonctionnement cerebral des patients.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

Apesar de raras estas podem apresentar-se como défices dos pares cranianos, sendo importante ter um elevado índice de suspeição e estar familiarizado com o seu diagnóstico e abordagem terapêutica. Os sintomas são por vezes muito inespecíficos, contudo os mais frequentes são as cefaleias, alterações da acuidade visual e diplopia no contexto de disfunção de um ou mais nervos oculares motores. Reporta-se o caso de um indivíduo do sexo masculino, 59 anos de idade, que foi referenciado ao Serviço de Urgência Otorrinolaringologia por quadro de cefaleias frontotemporais de carácter progressivo com uma semana de evolução e agravamento clínico nas últimas 12 horas associando-se diplopia. O exame neurológico sumário não releva outras alterações para além da parésia do nervo motor ocular comum esquerdo. Na rinoscopia anterior/posterior não se verificava presença de massas ou rinorreia mucopurulenta. A Tomografia Computadorizada revelava preenchimento por componente tecidual de partes moles dos seios esfenoidais e erosão do teto do seio esfenoidal esquerdo. Iniciou-se terapêutica endovenosa de largo espectro e corticoterapia sem melhoria clínica às 48 horas. Foi submetido a cirurgia endoscópica nassosinusal com boa resposta clínica e resolução completa da sintomatologia ao 10º dia pós-operatório. Os autores apresentam este caso pela sua raridade e pela sua importância no diagnóstico diferencial de doentes com cefaleias e parésia de pares cranianos.Palavras-chave: Sinusite Esfenoidal; Doenças do Nervo Oculomotor.",

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Essentially it is a more or less reversible psychotic episode appearing symptomatically during the course of an underlying physical disorder. Thus, it may occur in patients with no preexisting structural cerebral disease and may be associated with such conditions as drug intoxications, febrile states and cardiac and renal disease. It may also occur spontaneously or may be precipitated by the aforementioned factors in patients with preexisting structural cerebral disease.

Dissociative amnesia associated with dissociative fugue is an even more rare phenomenon. This case is unique in that the patient also suffered from schizoaffective disorder and it demonstrates how dissociative disorders can be comorbid with a psychotic disorder.

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "title": "A Rare Case of Very Young-Onset Dementia Presenting as Conversion Disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Dementia is uncommon in young adults and adolescents under the age of 40; genetic and metabolic problems are more common, and many show as a \"dementia plus\" syndrome, in which cognitive impairment occurs alongside more extensive neurological dysfunction. The presence of extrapyramidal, cerebellar, or peripheral nerve involvement is an important diagnostic indicator.[1] Psychotic symptoms are not included in the clinical diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Only a few authors have concentrated on this element of the presentation in the FTD case literature.[2] A 29-year-old woman, who had been married for 10 years, educated till high school, and working as an assistant in a parlor but not for the past 4 months, was brought with complaints of forgetfulness, irrelevant talk, irritability, impaired self-care, and episodic singing and dancing claiming to be possessed by a goddess lasting 5–10 minutes for the past 4 months. The symptoms were insidious in onset and progressive in nature. No past or family history of any psychiatric disorder was found. On mental status examination, rapport could not be established, the patient was oriented to only one person, and there were increased psychomotor activity in the form of restlessness, irrelevant talks with a confused, labile affect, formal thought disorder and preservation, and lack of insight and impaired judgment. A neurological evaluation showed equivocal Babinski signs bilaterally. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed more mild atrophy of the lateral temporal lobe than the medial temporal lobe [Figures 1 and 2]. Electroencephalogram (EEG), serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) autoimmune encephalopathy panels, and additional exhaustive testing for endocrinologic, immunologic, and infectious etiology were noncontributory. There was no improvement in treatment with antipsychotics and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The patient on follow-up showed deterioration in her symptoms along with the inability to recognize her family members. The patient passed away two years after the onset of her symptoms.Figure 1: T1 sagittal and coronal MRI sections, respectively, show mild prominence of sulcal spaces in the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal region with the prominence of bilateral sylvian fissures (more in temporal lobes)—suggestive of mild cortical atrophy, which is highly disproportionate to the ageFigure 2: T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) coronal MRI sections, respectively, suggest hyperintensities, more pronounced at bilateral frontal white matter regionThe frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD) are a category of illnesses marked by frontal and temporal lobe degeneration. The average age of onset is 45–60 years (range: 20–75); males are more likely to be afflicted.[3] Up to 50% of patients have a favorable family history, and a variety of genetic factors have been found.[4] The tau gene on chromosome 17 is mutated in the biggest single group: FTDP-17. The clinical appearance of FTD is diverse and typically subtle, with behavioral problems, personality changes, lack of empathy, and motivation dominating. Early retirement may be required due to a loss of planning and judgment. Misdiagnoses such as treatment-resistant depression or Alzheimer's disease are common among families and caregivers who ascribe behavioral changes to marital troubles or a \"mid-life crisis.\" Behavioral rigidity, disinhibition, loss of social skills, fatuousness, emotional lability, and impulsivity are common as the disease progresses and are often accompanied by executive dysfunction, decreased verbal fluency, impaired abstraction, difficulty shifting set, motor and verbal perseveration, and stereotypies.[1] FTLD advances faster than Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with the FTD clinical subtype, concomitant motor neuron illness, or tau-negative neuropathology have the quickest progression.[5] Our patient's sickness progressed faster and steadily, which conformed to the natural history of FTD caused by a genetic mutation. It is frequently coupled with mental symptoms and extremely little (or perhaps nonexistent) brain atrophy on MRI, which can make the clinical picture difficult to interpret. To explain conversion disorder misdiagnoses, a number of theories have been presented. The \"subtle interplay\" of biological and psychological models of neuropsychiatric illness, limited access to advanced imaging, current customs of neurological evaluation of functional neurological symptom disorders, and a limited neurobiological understanding of functional neurological disorders are among them.[6] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms. In the form the patient(s) has/have given his/her/their consent for his/her/their images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal. The patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity, but anonymity cannot be guaranteed.

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

Each is considered a disorder, diagnosed with a distinct set of diagnostic criteria. Spectrum conveys the idea that they are somehow similar to each other. Such similarity could be defined on purely clinical grounds or at the level of disease mechanism and aetiology. It is this tension of distinctiveness and similarity that makes the scientific study of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders challenging. The concept of the schizophrenia spectrum can be traced back to Bleuler and his book Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias. 1 The schizophrenias are characterised by significant heterogeneity of signs and symptoms, disease course and outcome. This gives rise to various clinical subtypes and to variants defined by a shorter duration of illness. Most importantly, the outcome of the schizophrenias ranges from long-term disability to",

      "abstract": "The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is a nosology; this means that it is a system of classification of diseases and disorders which primarily present mental and behavioral symptoms, although not exclusively (see, for instance, somatoform disorders), with independence of their etiology, most of them unknown. The DSM has, aside from other characteristics, a double sense; it is at the same time “the classification”, that is, the list of accepted diseases included under certain categories and “the system” for diagnosing them, or what is the same, the diagnostic mechanics of such disorders, which in this case is done through diagnostic criteria and a multiaxial system. The diagnostic criteria are basically the confirmation of the presence of behaviors and mental produce such as thoughts (deliria), personality traits (impulsivity), etc. It is based on the clinical detection of these phenomena in a descriptive manner and does not include etiological or etiopathogenic criteria simply because, beyond theories and models with more or less empirical or experimental basis, for most of the disorders included in the DSM, these are unknown. Furthermore, in some of those where a clear cerebral etiology is recognized, such as Alzheimer s type dementias, the complete etiopathogenic processes are unknown. The inclusion or not of a possible disorder and/or disease into the system, or its removal is carried out by a committee of experts who periodically makes revisions but not at fixed dates. This means that when a revision of the system or new edition is decided, committees of experts for the different categories are created who, after revising the scientific literature available in the period of time between two revisions, the different proposals made by institutions, and with the collaboration of the experts deemed necessary, make proposals which will or will not be accepted by the revision committee. The organization, on which the DSM depends and, therefore becomes its endorser, is the APA (American Psychiatric Association), and hence, the DSM reflects, to a great extent, the thought and dominant positions in the APA at any given moment. This organization is not the only source of influence on the manual. Since its third version in the nineteen-eighties, increasingly more efforts are being made to coordinate with the ICD system, which is the diagnostic coding system of diseases proposed, endorsed and used by the WHO (World Health Organization) and whose Chapter V is dedicated to mental and behavioral disorders. As a result, there is a more or less explicit aim that sooner or later a sole nosology in mental disorders with unique codes for each DSM, MENTAL HEALTH AND PARENTAL ALIENATION SYNDROME",

In this study, 50 violent offenders were interviewed with neuropsychological and psychometric measures, to determine the factors that underlie amnesia and the recovery of memory in these cases. The results showed that amnesia for a violent offense was associated with crimes of passion and dissociative symptoms at the time, but not with impaired neuropsychological functioning. Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

Both major clinical elements, the productive symptoms and the signs of deficit, seem in part to be reactive to the degree of stimulation in the psychosocial environment, though such factors by no means explain all their variability. The negative impairment tends to antedate florid onset and is a better predictor of social outcome than the florid symptoms. There is, however, no firm evidence that deterioration (deficit inevitably increasing with time) occurs. Manfred Bleuler's formulation summarises the overall outcome of a substantial part of what most clinicians who do not include a chronic course as part of the diagnosis call schizophrenia. About 20–25% recover, about 20–25% remain severely impaired throughout, the remainder run a fluctuating course.",

Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence.

It is biologically based, and primarily characterized by psychomotor activation, with mood changes being secondary and epiphenomenal. Mania may be diagnostically central to all mood illnesses, including depressive conditions. Mania enhances creativity, and in its milder forms, such as cyclothymic or hyperthymic temperaments, has many positive aspects, reflected in social benefits and historical achievements. Lack of insight impairs the self-understanding of the person with manic symptoms, and is an important clinical problem. Psychoanalytic and postmodernist approaches fail to appreciate these important features of mania.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a clinical anxiety disorder that is centrally characterized by excessive, pervasive, and chronic worry. Worry is a cognitive activity that involves repeatedly thinking about potential negative future events, such as “What if I can't finish this task?” “What if I never graduate?” “What if I have some type of illness?” According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), in order to warrant a diagnosis of GAD an individual must experience excessive and uncontrollable worry for at least 6 months, as well as three or more associated symptoms that are present, more days than not, over this time period. These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction has recently gained attention as a significant problem among migraine sufferers. All of the clinical studies show poor cognitive performance during migraine attacks, though, the interictal data are conflicting. Migraineurs show impaired cognitive function interictally in most of the clinic-based studies. Population-based studies did not reveal a difference in cognitive functions between migraineurs and controls. The specific cognitive domains involved are information processing speed, basic attention, executive functions, verbal and non-verbal memory and verbal skills. Neurophysiological, imaging and pharmacological studies support clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment in migraine. Longitudinal studies do not suggest progressive cognitive decline over time in migraine patients. Preventive medications and comorbid disorders such as depression and anxiety can impact cognitive function, but cannot fully explain the cognitive impairment in migraine. In contrast to migraine, tension type or cluster headache are not associated with cognitive impairment, at least during headache-free periods.",

MHP isclassified as a somatic type of delusional disorder in DSM-IV and is defined as an erroneous conviction of bodily disease, abnormality or alteration. It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

      "abstract": "A specific cognitive status epilepticus (e.g. aphasic status epilepticus) can occur occasionally, but the commoner and best known of purely or mainly cognitive manifestations are those subsumed under the term nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). This corresponds to a prolonged alteration of the mental state with continuous or sub-continuous generalized spikes or spike-wave discharges on the EEG. The prototype is absence status (petit mal status, spike-wave stupor, minor epileptic status),13,14 where there is clouding of awareness but, presumably, no specific cognitive deficit. Apathy, drowsiness, slowness, inattention, perplexity, strange affect, amnesia, slow speech are the most obvious abnormal behaviors. It is not clear to what degree higher-level mental functions are truly preserved and what new memories can be formed during these episodes: detailed studies are rare.15These NCSE can be phases in primary generalized epilepsies, but may be manifestations of complex partial status epilepticus of temporal or frontal origin.15 In temporal partial status epilepticus, only limited purposeful organized activity and responses to outside stimuli are possible and there is usually a total amnesia for the period. The epileptic nature is recognized by the presence, often subtle, of automatic motor behavior and vegetative phenomena.16,17 A special form of frequent refractory nonconvulsive partial status epilepticus, associated with ring chromosome 20, is probably of frontal origin and, because it is so frequent, should allow exploration of the affected and preserved behaviors and memories during seizures.18,19",

      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

On a purely descriptive basis, delusions may be complex or simple, transient or persistent, relatively compartmentalized or elaborate and intricately woven into the individual's view of reality. The content of delusions varies from patient to patient, and this content may or may not be congruent with the individual's mood. The delusions of individuals with dementia are most often paranoid or persecutory; they are also simple, as a high level of cognitive functioning seems to be required in order to elaborate complex delusions.

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder.

      "title": "Has the Drug of Choice for Treating Critical Illness Delirium Been Established?",
      "abstract": "Critical illness delirium (hereafter simplified to \"delirium\") is an acute confusional state seen in up to 80% of adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 1 It is characterized by an altered level of consciousness, changes in cognition, perceptual disturbances, a fluctuating course, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, disorientation, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and hallucinations or delusions. 1As a constellation of symptoms and signs that commonly occur together, delirium should not be considered in and of itself a disease, but rather should be thought of as a syndrome, 2 specifically one of acute brain dysfunction that can typically be traced back to one or more inciting causes.The mainstay of therapy, therefore, must aim to address the underlying causes of the syndrome and not simply treat the symptoms.Just as for a patient presenting with new-onset congestive heart failure it would be inappropriate to treat the symptoms by administering furosemide and oxygen without looking for and treating the underlying cause (e.g., an acute coronary syndrome), the drug of choice for delirium cannot simply be the one that best treats the symptoms; rather, it must address the underlying cause.Therefore, the drug of choice to treat any given case of delirium will be patient-and cause-specific.It could be the antibiotic that targets the patient's infection, the free water that addresses the patient's hypernatremia, the laxatives that resolve the patient's constipation, the benzodiazepine that counters the patient's alcohol withdrawal, or the correct treatment that addresses any of the myriad other causes of delirium.The number of potential drivers of delirium is immense, and the reader is encouraged to consult other sources for further information on their assessment and treatment. 1,3,4 Of course, although it is essential to address the underlying etiology of delirium, its symptoms cannot be ignored, as they have the potential to cause significant harm to both the patient and the patient's care team.Anyone who has worked in an ICU for any period of time will have seen a patient with delirium self-extubate or pull out a Foley catheter with the balloon up!Such adverse events can result in significant morbidity and potentially even death. 5 Additionally, patients experiencing delirium can pose a danger to the care team if they become aggressive to the point of striking and injuring care providers.What may be less obvious is that these agitated patients are also at increased risk of morbidity",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

Whereas most symptoms of the initial prodromal condition appear to be rather un-specific and hard to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions especially depressive ones, some syndromes seem to enable an early detection and thus an indicated prevention. These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other. Whereas the former are thought to delineate an advanced prodromal state, the latter can occur early in course and even at the beginning of the transition sequence to first-rank symptoms.

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

      "abstract": "The author fundamentally questions the traditional concept of the disease-entity (or several disease entities) of 'schizophrenia' and discusses an alternative concept, based on vulnerability and information-processing. According to this, schizophrenia-like psychotic phenomena develop in three phases. In the first, premorbid phase, combined biological (genetic and possibly other organic) and psycho-social influences lead to a premorbid 'vulnerability', characterised by a low tolerance of cognitive and emotional stress, corresponding to an insufficient capacity for the adequate processing of complex information. In the second phase, stressful life-events can lead to unique or repeated acute productive psychotic episodes. The third phase, that of long-term evolution, depends more on psycho-social influences than on biological factors. Under unfavourable conditions, it may lead to predominantly unproductive residual states of various degrees, which can largely be understood as regulatory mechanisms to restrict stressful over-stimulation. There is no clearly delimitable disease entity of schizophrenia with constant causes, psychopathological picture, or course, but rather a multi-conditioned life-process, occurring in people with a particular vulnerability, interacting with complex life-events and circumstances. This new concept has important consequences for therapy and prevention.",

      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

      "abstract": "FrenchDeux hypothèses opposées continuent à embrouiller le traitement pharmacologique des psychoses dépressives:1° La dépression résulte d'une déficience biochimique, marquée par la diminution de l'énergie psychocinétique. Elle doit être traitée par des méthodes stimulantes et énergétiques.2° Les états dépressifs sont des troubles multidimensionnels des fonctions psycho-biologiques. Il est impossible de les exprimer sous la forme d'un simple antagonisme.L'étude clinique des effets du Tofrānil a fait supposer dès le début que ce corps exerçait une activité sélective sur les syndromes dépressifs. On observe rarement une action mentale spécifique, au sens d'un syndrome psycho-affectif provoqué par la médication. Ni l'euphorie, ni la stimulation psychocinétique ne marchent régulièrement de pair avec les effets du Tofrānil sur le cerveau. La caractéristique thérapeutique de ce corps est une dissolution du syndrome dépressif, et une restauration de l'état affectif normal.Un fait étonnant est que le spectre de cette activité thérapeutique demeure discontinu. Alors que, dès le début des recherches, il a paru évident que le Tofrānil exerce son action optimale sur les dépressions accompagnées d'inhibition, on ne peut pas toujours escompter le résultat du traitement, du fait que certains sujets avec symptômes d'inhibition typiques ne sont nullement améliorés, tandis que d'autres voient leur état se modifier de façon impressionnante.L'attention des chercheurs s'est concentrée sur l'identification des facteurs psychopathologiques qui semblent particulièrement sensibles à l'action du Tofrānil. De tels symptômes ont été sélectionnés tant dans le domaine du comportement, que sur le plan psychosomatique et le plan expérimental. Au für et à mesure des progrès de la thérapeutique, il a été possible de préciser les signes, ou les groupes de signes, susceptibles de modification, ainsi que ceux qui demeuraient réfractaires au traitement. Les appréciations finales sont basées sur l'élimination totale ou partielle des symptômes-clés. Cette analyse phénoménologique s'est avérée très précieuse dans les recherches psychopharmacologiques entreprises pour identifier les effets différentiels des agents thérapeutiques.L'auteur cherche ensuite à déterminer si l'action thérapeutique est suspensive, correctrice ou préventive. Le matériel clinique comporte en première ligne des malades atteints de psychoses dépressives et hospitalisés. Il englobe, en outre, un groupe de patients en traitement ambulatoire, dont l'anamnèse présente de fréquents accès de dépression. L'auteur cherche, pour finir, à répondre à la question de savoir si les indications relatives du Tofrānil et du traitement électroconvulsif peuvent être formulées. Il se base pour cela sur des expériences de thérapeutique comparée, entreprises avec le même matériel clinique.",

      "title": "Проблема мотивации и ее нарушений при шизофрении",
      "abstract": "Motivation literally means 'to be driven to do something' and refers to processes dealing with the origin and maintenance of the target behavior. Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

This is largely because schizoaffective disorder is a mix of multiple mental health conditions that may run a unique course in each affected person. Individuals who have a family history of schizoaffective disorder and women are significantly higher at risk. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorder-5 is used as a guideline to characterize the disorder as well as to differentiate it from schizophrenia and other mood/affective disorders. The symptom depends on the two subtypes of schizoaffective disorder which includes the manic and depressive type. This paper also discusses the treatment needed to help patients cope with daily basis and improve their social skills. At the current situation there is no cure for schizoaffective patients, however treatments such as pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic which includes group counselling can help reduce worsening of symptoms in patients. Hence, an earlier detection enhances a better outcome.",

      "title": "Emotional deficiency and psychopathy",
      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

Emotional and physical symptoms occurring along a continuum of severity are common during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a complex of mild to moderate emotional and/or physical symptoms, which typically do not interfere with patients' usual level of functioning. Up to 75% of reproductive-aged women have reported premenstrual symptoms at some time during their lives. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome, which affects 3-8% of reproductive-aged women. The hallmark of premenstrual syndrome at all levels of severity is the exclusive occurrence of symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle with remission typically within 3 days of menses onset.",

This predisposition to affective episodes, rather than the episodes themselves (which can have many causes), is arguably the hallmark of bipolar disorder. Most episodes of bipolar disorder, including the first episode, are depressive. This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychosis in epilepsy may occur in different forms, ranging from brief episodes with a clear temporal relationship to seizures (ictal or postictal psychosis) to symptoms or signs apparently independent of seizures, often manifesting decades after the onset of epilepsy (interictal psychosis). In some patients postictal psychosis develops into interictal psychosis over time. Psychosis may also be observed after epilepsy surgery despite excellent seizure control. The features of psychosis in epilepsy closely resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The prevalence of psychosis is higher in patients with epilepsy compared to the general population; it is less clear whether the prevalence of epilepsy is increased in patients with schizophrenia. Subtle structural brain anomalies have been found in both disorders, and it remains uncertain by what mechanisms schizophrenia and psychosis of epilepsy are related. In terms of treatment, the control of underlying seizure activity is most important in ictal psychosis, for instance psychosis occurring in the context of non-convulsive status epilepticus. Postictal psychosis is usually brief and self-limiting. Treatment is therefore rarely problematic. Short-acting benzodiazepines and neuroleptic drugs are recommended. The treatment of more prolonged interictal psychoses can be challenging and there are no universally accepted neuroleptic treatment regimes.",

However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

Therefore, the WONCA Working Party for Primary Mental Health asked for MUS guidance for family doctors worldwide in order to improve the care of patients with MUS globally. This article is a summary of this guidance.\n\nMUS are physical symptoms that have existed for several weeks and for which adequate medical examination or investigation have not revealed any condition that sufficiently explains the symptoms. MUS is a working hypothesis based on the (justified) assumption that somatic or psychiatric pathology have been adequately detected and treated, but that the clinical condition presented by the patients was not adequately resolved. Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS.1 For some patients with physical symptoms, a somatic or psychiatric condition may be present. However, if the physical symptoms are more severe or more persistent, or limit functioning to a greater extent than expected based on the condition in question, they too are referred to as MUS.\n\nMUS can be seen as a continuum ranging from self-limiting symptoms to recurrent and/or persisting symptoms and symptom disorders.

      "abstract": "(1) A technique, based upon Spearman's tetrad difference criterion, has been evolved for the empirical determination of the syndromes of psychiatry. (2) This technique has given in a purely empirical manner eight syndromes and their constituent symptoms. (1) The Syndrome of Cognitive Defect which is positively related to præcox conditions but, negatively, to manic-depressive. (2) The Catatonic Syndrome, probably the inhibitory phase of dementia praæcox. (3) The Uninhibited or Kinetic Syndrome, probably the excited phase of dementia præcox. (4) The Non-Euphoric Manic Syndrome, which is probably also a phase or form of dementia præcox. (5) The Euphoric Manic Syndrome, which is probably the underlying condition in the manic form of manic-depressive insanity. (6) The Delusional Hallucinatory Syndrome, also a factor in dementia præcox. (7) The Syndrome of Constitutional Hereditary Depression, which indicates an hereditary factor that attacks the controlling mechanism of emotional life or heightens emotivity, but leaves the cognitive general factor untouched. (8) The Syndrome of Retarded Depression, which is not as yet clearly differentiated. (3) Reasons are given for regarding these syndromes as neurological defects of a definite nature. (4) The measures used in the determination of the general factor can now be applied to the diagnosis of the above syndromes. The development of a procedure for doing this in a definite and simple manner is now in progress.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

In this framework, the association of epilepsy with psychotic disorders has long been known.To discuss the links between epilepsy and psychosis, we report the observation of a 52-year-old man, treated for complex focal epilepsy, admitted to a psychiatric department for auditory and visual hallucinations and a behavioural disorder not improved by antiepileptic treatment alone or an antipsychotic alone.Psychotic symptoms in epilepsy can be part of intercritical, post-critical or alternative psychoses. In our patient's case, the psychotic symptoms were post-critical and alternative. It was probably an associated schizophreniform disorder. Emotional indifference and activity restriction are rarely encountered in this setting, while rapid mood fluctuations are frequent. Delusional themes are often mystical, fueled by auditory and unusual visual hallucinations. Negative disorders are rare.Epileptic psychoses have not been identified as nosographic entities in the psychiatric classification systems (DSM-V and ICD-10), which poses a problem in recognizing these disorders. Therefore, a collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists is necessary to understand this complex comorbidity better, avoid diagnostic errors, and optimize management.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this analysis was to highlight the significance of psychotherapy in the treatment of depressive mood disorders in older adults, as well as to expand the knowledge of social educators and geragogists regarding the basic symptoms of depression. Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

Early spontaneous remissions have been well described but most such remissions occurred within the first few months following neuroleptic withdrawal, and no published studies have followed patients for more than 2 years to evaluate permanence of remission. Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

The onset of symptoms within 1 month (ICD) and 3 months (DSM) is not evidence based. The symptoms may be depressive, anxious, behavioural, or a mixture of these. A useful clinical indicator that the event was the trigger is that the intensity of the symptoms increases when it is being recalled or recounted and diminishes when the person is removed from it. A number of differentials should also be considered. ICD-11 proposes specific criteria for ICD-11 that include preoccupation with the stressor and difficulty adapting, as evidenced by impaired concentration, sleep disturbance, and so on, causing impairment in functioning.

The nature of the symptoms, however, can help clinicians differentiate CFS from other illnesses.

      "abstract": "Febrile seizures (FS) are nosological entities that affect 2–5% of children aged 6 months to 5 years. In most cases, these seizures are isolated or sporadic; they are defined as simple febrile seizures. However, a febrile seizure that lasts more than 15 min, which has focal signs, or that recurs within 24 h is defined as \"complex\" febrile seizure. Prolonged febrile seizure (PFS) is therefore a particular type of complex febrile seizure. In case the duration exceeds 30 min, the more appropriate definition is febrile status epilepticus (FSE). Electroencephalogram (EEG) is not indicated in the routine evaluation of simple febrile seizures; on the other hand, the role of EEG in children with complex febrile seizures including febrile status epilepticus is not well-known. The acute EEG findings after prolonged febrile seizures reveal abnormal activity in at least one third of cases across different series. Epileptiform discharges might be seen in patients with febrile status epilepticus in a small portion of patients. It is possible that the occurrence of spikes indicates a genetic susceptibility. The long-term value of the early EEG findings after prolonged febrile seizures is not yet known, but the data so far suggest that the focal slowing is not associated with pre-existing focal structural lesions since it is only present for a short period of time.",

Of course, this usage eliminates neither illnesses nor the subjective experience of being ill, but it has implications for forensic psychiatry and for the assessment of a person’s legal responsibility. Having schizophrenic delusions constitutes a categorically different state from having only wishful illusions or a vivid imagination. In the context of medicine and psychiatry, we certainly encounter stages that signal fundamental differences. These differences are easily detected when assessing psychotic disorders or similar states, but a lot of differences also arise when assessing perpetrators with personality disorders or simply antisocial behavior. Where, in these states, are the borders that demarcate full responsibility from substantially reduced social responsibility?",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

In addition she displayed evidences of organic brain dysfunction: impaired visual-motor and visual-perceptual functions, and abnormality of the electroencephalogram. Within days the most florid evidences of disturbance had disappeared but the thinking disorder, distortion of body image, and depression of intelligence quotient persisted for several months.

      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Pressure is a thermodynamic variable that, like temperature, affects the states of matter. High pressure is an environmental characteristic of the deep sea. Immersion to depth brings about an increase in pressure of 0.1 MPa (1 atm) for each 10 m of seawater. Humans exposed to high pressure, mostly professional divers, suffer effects that are proportional to their exposure.The nervous system is one of the most sensitive targets of high pressure. The high pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS) begins to show signs at about 1.3 MPa (120 m) and its effects intensify at greater depths. HPNS starts with tremor at the distal extremities, nausea, or moderate psychomotor and cognitive disturbances. More severe consequences are proximal tremor, vomit, hyperreflexia, sleepiness, and psychomotor or cognitive compromise. Fasciculations and myoclonia may occur during severe HPNS. Extreme cases may show psychosis bouts, and focalized or generalized convulsive seizures. Electrophysiological studies during HPNS display an EEG characterized by reduction of high frequency activity (alpha and beta waves) and increased slow activity, modification of evoked potentials of various modalities (auditory, visual, somatosensory), reduced nerve conduction velocity and changes in latency. Studies using experimental animals have shown that these signs and symptoms are progressive and directly dependent on the pressure.

      "abstract": "From the earliest description of schizophrenia, amotivational syndrome associated with severe functional impairment is recognised. These symptoms are found to be independent from other symptoms in longitudinal and cross-sectional assesments. The negative symptoms are named as primary or idiopathic if they are present at beginning of the disease or if it is specific to the disease. If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms. Treatment approach depends on whether negative symptoms are primary or secondary. Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

Children with DMDD showed a low frustation tolerance and experiencing difficulty in regulating emotions, low tolerance in a state of distress and trouble in controlling behaviors. Between attack, children showed persistent irritability mood throughthout the day which can be observed by parents, teachers and peers. Diagnosis is made when this disorder lasts in at least two settings in different places (home, school, neighborhood). Onset of symptoms before age 10 years, but diagnose can't be made before the age of 6 years and above 18 years. Symptoms that stick out are chronic irritability, known by Leibenluft as severe mood dysregulation (SMD), which in the DSM V known as DMDD. Chronicity of symptoms indicating a mismatch with symptoms episode according to DSM IV, where manic episode lasts at least 4 days and hypomania for at least one week. Based on the results of researches, DMDD will evolve into anxiety and depression disorders, and not a bipolar disorder in adulthood. SMD can be distinguished from DmDD by the onset of age and the presence of hyperarousal. In SMD, hyperarousal symptoms can be found on an episode of mania and sometimes on ADHD, chronic, and non episodic irritability with onset before 12 years of age. There has been no appropriate tools to assess and diagnose DMDD. Child Behavior Checklist Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP) can be used as a tool to identify patients with severe mood disorders. High Scoring indicate persistence problems with bad outcomes such as substance abuse, suicidality, and functional disorders in facing life.",

Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

Its manifestations can also include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and behavior disorders. Though the acute episode seldom lasts from one to three weeks, it has good prognosis and there is practically no residue after the symptoms disappear. A review about the evolution and the actual interest and adequacy of this clinical entity. The very existence of hysterical psychosis as a diagnostic entity has been questioned as part of the general difficulty in defining both hysteria and psychosis. A non-systematic review of PubMed articles. The hysterical psychosis occurs in patients with a hysterical personality / histrionic, with more colorful psychotic symptoms, which are somehow characteristic. This seems to condition the definition of a well defined nosological entity, as long as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. It still seems questionable whether the concept of hysterical psychosis should be kept as an entity with well-defined etiologic determinants, however in clinical terms this approach may have advantages.",

The latter, as transient mood states, can be triggered by events. If the illness depression is viewed as a kind of supersadness or the illness mania as superelation, then by extension one might assume that those discrete disorders can also be triggered by events.

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

The development of anxiety or depressive disorders are common with demoralization, another psychological syndrome, a topic of interest in psychiatry. To feel demoralized is to lose hope, courage, or confidence, which upsets normal functioning. While depression may co-exist with demoralization, they are 2 distinct entities, with the former characterized by an inability to experience pleasure and the latter characterized by helplessness and avoidance coping. In an effort to more adequately address the psychological stress in organ transplant patients, it is important to distinguish between demoralization and depression. Demoralization has prognostic implications such as negative disease outcomes such as treatment nonadherence and an increase risk of suicide. Medication for depression is not effective for demoralization syndrome.

      "title": "Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood and affects approximately1% of\r\nthe population. EOS begins before the age of eighteen, while VEOS begins before the age of\r\nthirteen. Since etiopathogenesis remains unclear, there are various theories about the emergence\r\nof schizophrenia: the dopamine theory, the genetic theory, the psychodynamic theory, the\r\nenvironmental theory and other. Schizophrenia is a multidimensional disease characterized by\r\nheterogeneous symptoms. The psychotic symptoms are present in children and adolescents even\r\nbefore the diagnosis of the disease. The symptoms are divided into positive, negative and\r\ndisorganisation symptoms. The expression of symptoms in children differs from those in adults\r\ndue to the cognitive variation of different ages. The delay of the cognitive development is quite\r\noften in EOS. The cognitive impairment is a basic symptom of schizophrenia and it has an\r\ninfluence on the course and recovery. DSM-V define the criteria for the diagnosis: delusions,\r\nhallucinations, disorganized speech or behaviour, and negative symptoms. The indicators of a\r\nworse outcome are: worse cognition, male sex, earlier beginning, poor economic condition, long\r\nnon-treated period, previous lower social adjustment, and negative symptoms. The most common\r\ncomorbidity is drug abuse. The conditions considered for differential diagnosis are: general\r\nmedical conditions, other psychotic disorders, pervasive developmental disorder and autism.\r\nTherapy include: antipsychotics, psychoeducation and psychotherapy. Antipsychotics are the\r\nfirst-line therapy, and the atipycal antipsychotics are the first choice. Typical (classical) and\r\natypical (newer) antipsychotics are used in therapy. It is necessary to include psychotherapy,\r\nparticularly cognitive therapy and psychoeducation.",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: drug-induced psychiatric states.",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder requires the presence of persistent obsessions, compulsions, or both (more than 1 hour each day) that are repetitive and difficult to control. In addition, the symptoms must cause marked distress or cause significant interference in functioning. If no evidence of obsessions or compulsions is obtained, the interviewer may skip to the section on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)/Acute Stress Disorder.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

HS was found in several post mortem series of demented patients either in association with specific pathologies, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) or isolated. The symptomatology and etiology of HS remain unclear, but, in the cases of pure HS, the usual clinical diagnosis was AD. It is suggested that HS could explain unusual association of an amnestic syndrome with fronto-temporal dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies. Moreover, it could also be responsible of amnestic disorders similar to those found in AD, but remaining isolated during many years. Epilepsy or anoxia, the main causes of HS, are rarely found in the history of demented people with HS. Therefore, HS might be due to a degenerative process close to dementias lacking histologic features. Diagnosis of HS can be made during life using MRI, specially high resolution MRI or fast-spin echo relaxation time.",

Pada intinya, jet lag merupakan akibat dari ketidaksesuaian yang terjadi setelah melewati daerah dengan waktu yang terlalu cepat. Jet lag memiliki ciri ketidaksesuaian yang sementara antara endogen sirkardian tidur/bangun dan lingkungan fisik eksternal yang mengarah pada perubahan waktu.

Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "A 29-year-old man was admitted because of sudden onset of retrograde amnesia. The patient was unable to recall events having occurred during the past 2 years. The impairment was especially serious with regard to personal memories during the 5 months prior to admission, while he had first been working as a full-time employee under stressful circumstance. A diagnosis of dissociative amnesia was made on the basis of absence of any systemic or neurological diseases that could cause amnesia, the inadaptable character of the patient, the nature of amnesia, and presence of stressful condition possibly related to the amnesia. Visual event-related potential (ERP) studies recorded with human face discrimination tasks demonstrated a P3a wave in response to a face of his superior in the office, whom he said that he had never seen before. The similar P3a wave was observed in response to a face quite familiar to the patient, his mother, but not to a face truly unknown to him. These findings suggest that the visual memory of his superior's face exists in the brain, but the patient is unable to retrieve it by some psychogenic mechanism. 131I-IMP SPECT revealed decreased perfusion in the left medial temporal lobe and the basal forebrain, suggesting the association between dissociative amnesia and focal brain dysfunction. While dissociative amnesia has been understood as psychogenic nature, both ERPs and SPECT are quite important tools to understand the association between the psychological phenomenon and biological changes of the brain in this disorder.",

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

Malgre les nombreux progres de la prevention et du traitement medical de l’epilepsie de l’enfant, le taux de troubles psychopathologiques reste stable depuis plus de trente ans. Certains troubles ne sont pas plus frequemment retrouves que chez des temoins avec maladie chronique (depression), alors que d’autres le sont davantage (troubles de l’attention, troubles sociaux, troubles de la pensee), ou sont particulierement associes a certains syndromes epileptiques (troubles envahissants du developpement). D’autre part, des troubles du comportement et la depression sont parfois retrouves avant l’apparition d’une epilepsie, ce qui plaide en faveur d’un dysfonctionnement neurobiologique commun a l’epilepsie et aux troubles psychiatriques. L’etude des variables influencant l’apparition de tels troubles montre des resultats contradictoires. Les variables propres a l’epilepsie ne semblent pas influer sur les troubles psychiatriques, sauf par le biais des troubles cognitifs secondaires a l’epilepsie. En revanche, les variables familiales (troubles du fonctionnement familial, depression maternelle plus frequemment retrouves que chez les parents d’enfants temoins), et surtout la perception parentale du controle de l’epilepsie predisent mieux l’ajustement parental que le niveau de controle de l’epilepsie. Tous les auteurs soulignent que malgre ce constat, la prise en charge psychiatrique est notoirement insuffisante. Ces resultats incitent a proposer des modeles complexes pour mieux comprendre, evaluer et traiter ces troubles, comme les modeles complementaires et epigenetiques.",

The treatment should be immediately initiated whenever a patient has a convulsion that persists more than 5 min, has a second seizure in the posictal period, or experience a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion at the time of arrival in the emergency department. The typical temporal evolution of CSE affects its prognosis since subtil SE is more refractory to treatment than evident SE. The monitoring of any kind of treatment protocol should have not only a careful clinical observation but also an EEG continuous record.",

In the first, depression or unipolar depression, the patient’s mood varies between being either normal or depressed; he or she never becomes excessively elated. In the second, manic-depression or bipolar illness, the patient’s mood varies between being depressed (as in unipolar depression) and being “high” or “euphoric.”",

      "title": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with Psychotic Features:-A Phenomenological Study",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY It has been postulated that obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) lies in a cuntinuum between schizophrenia and the neurotic disorders. Patients of pure OCD develop psychotic symptoms when there is a transient loss of insight or there is emergence of paranoid ideas. Depression is frequently associated with OCD, which could either be a complication of OCD or could be an independent coexisting disorder. In our study, 17 out of 52 OCD patients had psychotic features. Relatively more patients in the psychotic group were found to be single. They had higher score on YBOCS, BPRS and HDRS (SIGH-D} as compared to the OCD patients without psychotic features, 76.47% of the patients with psychotic features also fulfilled the DSM III-R criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. The possible explanation and implication of the findings have been discussed in the light of relevant literature. Key words: obsession, compulsion, psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms INTRODUCTION Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (OCD) is characterized by recurrent obsessions or compulsion that are significantly distressing or time consuming or that cause significant interference with social or occupational functioning (DSM IIIR, APA, 1987). It has been postulated that obsessive compulsive disorders lies in a continuum between schizophrenia and the neurotic disorders (Goldberg, 1965; Blacker, 1966). Obsessive compulsive symptoms have also been observed in schizophrenia (Stengel, 1945. Rosen, 1957; Fenton McGlashan, 1990), in whom obsession may precede schizophrenic symptoms. Earlier studies by Rudin (1953), Ingrain (1961), and Lo (1967) have shown that 1%-10% of patients with OCD subsequently develop schizophrenia, however Goodwin et al (l969) pointed out that most of these studies had used a broad criteria for the diagnosis of OCD. Inspite of the high incidence of psychosis in, OCD most of the cases cannot be diagnosed as schizophrenia according to current diagnostic systems. Welner et al (1976) had reported that out of their 14 patients of OCD with psychotic symptoms (having delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) only 2 met the criteria for schizophrenia while the remaining 12 showed prominent affective symptoms. The relation between OCD and depression is complex, with some believing depression to be a complication of OCD (Lo, 1967; Rosenberg, 1968, Goodwin et al, 1969), whilst others believe that OCD and depression are two distinct disorders which often co-exist (Monteiro et al. 1986; Jenike et al, 1987. Vallejo et al, 1988: Rasmussen & Eisen, 1989). Goodwin et al (1969), after reviewing 13 follow-up studies had concluded that OCD patients were predisposed to depression but did not develop schizophrenia more frequently than non obsessional patients. In fact, Insel Akiskal (1986) have asserted that in the current classificatory systems most of the OCD cases with psychotic features will be either diagnosed as snood disorders or paranoid state rather than schizophrenia. The present study was conducted to assess the presence of psychotic features and depression simultaneously in OCD patients in whom schizophrenia was ruled out and to examine the relationship between the psychotic features and depression. MATERIALS AND METHOD This study was conducted at Central Institute of Psychiatry (C.I.P.), which is a 643 bedded premier postgraduate teaching institute situated in eastern India. It is run by the Central government of India, and is an important referral centre for the collieries, the railways, the states of Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar Orissa, the entire north-eastern states and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The hospital also gets referrals from the neighboring countries like Nepal and Bhutan. The Institute runs postgraduate training courses in Psychiatry, Clinical Psychology, Psychiatric Social Work and Psychiatric Nursing. In the OPD all cases are worked up by junior residents. …",

DSM-5 has changed important criteria and no longer considers doubts about one's gender to constitute a mental disorder. Rather, gender dysphoria is solely concerned with the affective concerns and not the determination of the physical outcome. Psychological treatment for gender dysphoria will generally involve a team approach that incorporates psychotherapy along with medical treatment. Other specific gender dysphoria would be diagnosed when the full criteria for gender dysphoria are not met even though symptoms cause significant functional impairment. Unspecified gender dysphoria refers to presentations in which the full criteria for gender dysphoria are not met and there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis, or the clinician chooses not to specify the reason.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "title": "Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: The role of mood stabilizers",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with symptoms that extend far beyond cognitive deficits. The most distressing of these symptoms are known as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and include delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggression, misidentification, and sexually inappropriate behaviors. As a result of BPSD, AD patients suffer a poorer quality of life, as do their caregivers.1 Behavioral and psychological symptoms can be so distressing to the caregiver that they are a common reason for families placing their loved ones in long-term care. Approximately 60% and 80% of dementia patients living in the community and in long-term care settings develop BPSD, respectively.1Aggression and agitation are characterized by increased or disruptive psychomotor activity, inappropriate verbal activity, or disorganized motor activity that is not explained by the patient's needs. Often times, dementia patients present with aggression and agitation as well as psychotic symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics have been the most widely studied agents for the management of psychotic symptoms as well as aggression and agitation.1 Despite their noted efficacy for BPSD, their use has been curtailed over recent years due to concerns about an increase in cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with their use. This has led to an ongoing search for other effective pharmacologic treatments for BPSD. Several mood stabilizers including valproic acid, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate have been studied in dementia patients. This paper aims to present the data on the efficacy of mood stabilizing drugs for the management of BPSD.In 2007, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) developed a white paper on the use of antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia for the purpose of treating psychosis and agitation.1 This paper also reviewed the use of numerous other psychotropic drugs in this population. Evidence for atypical antipsychotic efficacy in psychosis of dementia indicated that these agents have modest efficacy. The data are difficult to interpret because these studies often included patients with psychosis and agitation. To further complicate the studies, the primary outcome was often a measure of global psychiatric symptoms, not a rating scale to assess psychosis or agitation only. There have been very few studies evaluating the use of atypical antipsychotics for agitation only. This is partly due to the fact it is difficult to recruit dementia patients with agitation only since it frequently overlaps with psychosis. Agents such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole have reportedly shown some benefit for agitation in dementia patients.Nearly 10 years ago, the FDA issued a warning regarding cerebrovascular events (CVEs) such as strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) associated with the use of risperidone. Soon after, the FDA evaluated CVE's with other atypical antipsychotics and the warning was added to olanzapine and aripiprazole. Furthermore, an analysis of pooled data indicated that the rates of CVEs were 1.9% for patients receiving atypical antipsychotics and 0.9% for placebo-treated patients (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–2.8). Of course there are limitations to these data, most notably of which is that these studies were not powered to evaluate the relationship between drug and adverse events; they were powered to evaluate efficacy. In addition, the definition of CVE is not defined in the studies, nor were these events validated. Lastly, there is likely no difference in the rates of CVEs between typical and atypical agents.In addition to the risk of CVEs, increased mortality rates in the elderly have been reported with atypical antipsychotics. These data led the FDA to issue a black box warning for antipsychotics in the elderly regarding the higher mortality rates, which were mostly due to cardiac or infectious disease. A meta-analysis reported that the elderly mortality rate was 3.5% with atypical agents compared to 2.3% with placebo. Again, there were numerous limitations cited including limited data regarding the circumstances around the deaths as well as controversy surrounding the mortality risk in patients receiving typical antipsychotics.The study known as the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness for Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) evaluated the use of antipsychotics in elderly dementia patients under naturalistic conditions.2 Patients were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of treatment for any reason as well as minimal improvement as noted on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks. Patients reportedly discontinued quetiapine due to lack of efficacy after a mean of only 9.1 weeks compared to olanzapine and risperidone where patients continued treatment for a mean of 22.1 and 26.7 weeks, respectively. Patients discontinued all treatments earlier than placebo due to adverse events.In addition to reporting the efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and agitation, the ACNP white paper also reported on the use of other psychotropic drugs for these symptoms.1 There were three trials that evaluated the efficacy of VPA for agitation or aggression in dementia patients.3–5 Two of the studies were completed in patients with agitation and one with patients with aggression. All three studies failed to show any benefit of VPA over placebo for management of aggression or agitation. Additionally, two trials evaluated the short-term (6 week) use of carbamazepine (CBZ) for agitation. Both CBZ trials were small (n of 51 and 21), and reported mixed results. Total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores indicated that CBZ was more effective than placebo in one study7 but no difference was found in the other.6 Olin and colleagues actually reported that there was a significant improvement on the hostility item of the BPRS but a worsening of the hallucination item in CBZ-treated patients.6 The authors also reported that their study lacked statistical power and that they would have needed 69 patients in order to confirm the findings regarding the total BPRS scores.6Unfortunately, the long-term use of CBZ is limited by its poor tolerability, including ataxia and disorientation, and the risk of significant drug-drug interactions.Since the publication of the ACNP white paper, there has been one further study that evaluated the efficacy of VPA in agitation and aggression.8 This study included patients with moderate to severe AD and were experiencing agitation or aggression based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scores (NPI). Patients had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV)9 criteria for AD, have a mini-mental status exam (MMSE) score of < 15, and an NPI > 8. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Each treatment period was 6 weeks with a 2 week wash-out period. Forty patients were referred, but consent was obtained from only 16. Two patients dropped out prior to enrollment, leaving 14 in the study (8M, 6F). Prior to starting the study, patients underwent a wash-out of current psychotropic medications for a period equal to 5 half-lives of the drugs. Treatment was initiated with VPA 125 mg twice per day for one week and increased to 500 mg twice per day during week two. The dose was increased according to symptom response and patient tolerability to a maximum of 1,500 mg per day. The dose could be decreased, as needed. Loxapine 2.5 mg up to 4 doses per week was permitted as a rescue medication. The primary outcome was the NPI agitation score. Secondary measures were the NPI total score and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Wilcoxon signed ranks tests comparing the change in scores for VPA vs. placebo.The results indicated that the NPI agitation scores decreased for VPA-treated patients and increased for placebo-treated patients (1.43+/−3.87 vs-2.08 +/−4.05, p=0.043). The change in scores for the VPA group represents a worsening of symptoms. Worsening of symptoms was also seen on the total NPI and CMAI scores, but was significant only for the CMAI (NPI p=0.075 and CMAI p=0.039). Twelve VPA patients had adverse effects such as falls (5), sedation (4), thrombocytopenia (2), and loose stools (2). The placebo group had 2 patients with sedation and 1 fall. The conclusion is that VPA was ineffective for agitation and aggression and was poorly tolerated in elderly AD patients.A second study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of VPA for preventing agitation and aggression in AD patients.10 Patients had to meet criteria for possible or probable AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke AND the Alzheimer's Diseaseand Related Disorders Association criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA), have a MMSE of 12–20, and be free from agitation or psychosis as defined by NPI < 1 on items assessing delusions, hallucinations, or agitation. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm flexible-dose study. Patients received VPA for two years in a double-blind fashion, and then had a two-month, single-blind placebo treatment period. The VPA target dose was 10–12 mg/kg and used identical appearing VPA and placebo tablets. The primary outcome was defined as the development of a score of at least 3 on one or more NPI items assessing delusions, hallucinations, and agitation for 2 weeks. Other scales used to assess secondary outcomes included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), CMAI, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living (ADCS-Activities of Daily Living), the Quality of Life-AD, and the ADCS Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The primary endpoint was evaluated using the cox proportional hazards model comparing time to end point in the drug and placebo groups and adjusted for variables such as age, sex, baseline MMSE, total NPI, total CMAI, and ADCS-Activities of Daily Living. All assessments were completed at baseline, and every three months until the 24th month, then at month 26. Five hundred thirteen patients were screened and 313 were randomized. At enrollment, the mean MMSE in both groups was 16.9 and the NPI subscales for agitation, delusions, and hallucinations were < 1.0. The mean modal dose of VPA was 250 mg/day and the mean VPA level at 12 months was 42.7 mcg/ml. Sixty-one percent of VPA and 62% of placebo patients discontinued treatment early. The time to the primary endpoint did not differ between the two groups (p=0.88). Twenty-nine placebo and 25 VPA patients reached the endpoint. The mean change in ADAS-cog scores indicated that there were some differences that favored placebo (VPA 9.4, PLC 6.8, p=0.01). The ADCS Activities of Daily Living scores at 18 months also favored placebo (VPA-19.3, PLC-14.4, p=0.02). More VPA than placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (16% vs 7.5%). This study failed to show any benefit of VPA in preventing the development of agitation, delusions, or hallucinations.Due to the intolerability and drug interactions noted in carbamazepine trials as well as the lack of efficacy reported with VPA, other mood stabilizers have been evaluated for controlling BPSD. Topiramate (TOP) is a viable option secondary to its reported efficacy in controlling irritability and aggression in other psychiatric populations.11 However, there is concern with the use of TOP in the dementia population due to cognitive decline reported with its use.To date, there is only one published, prospective trial of TOP for aggression in dementia patients.12 This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing topiramate to risperidone (RIS) that included 48 patients with mild to moderate severity of AD defined by an MMSE score of 10–26. Patients were included if they had a complaint of behavioral disturbances and had an NPI score of greater than 1 in sub-items relating to delusions; hallucinations; agitation and aggression; and irritability and lability. Topiramate was initiated at 25 mg/day and increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks. Risperidone was initiated at 0.25 mg/day with a doubling in dose every week until target dose of 2 mg/day was achieved. In both groups, the dose could be reduced if adverse events occurred. The mean daily dose of TOP was 44.0 mg and RIS was 1.9 mg. Any improvement on NPI parts 1 and 2 or the CMAI were considered the primary outcomes. Part 1 of the NPI assesses behavioral disturbances and affective and psychotic symptoms; part 2 assesses caregiver burden and distress. Cognitive function was assessed with the MMSE.Forty eight patients were enrolled, but 41 completed the trial. Seven patients dropped out due to adverse events; fatigue and loss of appetite were reported in the TOP group and GI disturbance and akathisia in the RIS group. Both groups showed improvements in the NPI parts 1 and 2 from baseline to week 8. However, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups (NPI part I: P<0.575, NPI part 2: P<0.456). Both groups also showed a decrease in agitation as assessed by CMAI scores but no statistically significant difference noted (P<0.927). Cognitive status on the MMSE was not found to change significantly in either group (P<0.479). In conclusion, the authors found that low dose TOP had comparable efficacy to RIS in treating behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia. However, nearly 15% failed to complete the study due to adverse events.Carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating BPSD, but carries a high risk for adverse events and drug-drug interactions.1 Oxcarbazepine(OXC) has been hypothesized to be efficacious as it has a similar structure to carbamazepine, but with better tolerability. There are case reports suggesting that oxcarbazepine may be beneficial in treating BPSD. To formally evaluate the efficacy of OXC for BPSD, an 8 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial for the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with a diagnosis of AD, vascular dementia, or mixed dementia was conducted.13 This study included patients with moderate to severe dementia as defined by a MMSE of 0–20, a history of agitation or aggression for at least 1 week, a score of 6 or greater on Neurospychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) subscale for agitation and aggression, and were in a nursing home for at least 4 weeks. Patients who were receiving psychotropic medications prior to the study could not have dose changes within 2 weeks before and throughout the study. New psychotropic agents could not be initiated during the study except for haloperidol if needed as a rescue medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive OXC 300–900 mg/day or placebo. Oxcarbazepine was initiated at 75 mg in the morning and 225 mg in the evening with dose increases up to a total of 900 mg/day after 3 weeks with the highest, well-tolerated dose maintained. The mean daily dose of OXC was 536.6 mg/day. The primary outcome was the change in the agitation and aggression subscore of NPI-NH. Secondary outcomes included change in agitation measured by the Brief Agitation Rating Scale (BARS) and change in burden of care measured by NPI-NH.A total of 103 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication with 83 patients completing the study. No significant difference was found between groups for any of the outcomes assessed regardless of whether the intention to treat or per protocol population analysis was used (NPI-NH agitation and aggression subscore P=0.70, BARS P=0.07, NPI-NH P=0.58). Interestingly, there was also no significant difference between groups in the use of haloperidol (P=0.26). The most common side effects occurring in the active treatment group included urinary tract infections, falls, a decrease in serum sodium, ataxia, fainting, and sedation. In conclusion, the study failed to show any benefit of OXC for the management of agitation or aggression in patients with moderate to severe dementia.There have been some smaller, open studies and case studies published on this topic involving other mood stabilizers not already mentioned in this review. A recent case series showed benefit with low dose gabapentin 200–600 mg/day in treating aggressive behavior in seven patients with the vascular or mixed dementia.14 Gabapentin was well tolerated and produced sustained results at follow up varying from 2–6 months.14Lamotrigine has shown to be effective and well-tolerated over six months in a case report of a patient diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia who was demonstrating verbal and physical aggression.15 Another case series of five patients with dementia, manic-like symptoms, and agitation treated with lamotrigine reported improvements on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) after five months of treatment.16 None of the patients had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events.Two small, open-label trials with less than 20 patients each reported the effectiveness of levetiracetam for the management of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Both trials found significant improvement from baseline in the NPI and YMRS.17,18 One report indicated that three patients required a dose reduction of levetiracetam as two patients experienced lethargy and one had an increase in agitation.17 The second study noted that no patient had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events, but did not mention if any dose reductions were required.18Since the publication of the ACNP White Paper in 2007, there have only been three randomized clinical trials studying mood stabilizers for treatment of BPSD. Low-dose TOP and RIS were reported to be equally effective for BPSD. Prospective, placebo-controlled trials of OXC and VPA failed to show any benefit in patients with BPSD. Open trials and case studies have shown some limited effectiveness for gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam and require further evaluation in a controlled setting.Due to a paucity of data indicating efficacy and safety, no mood stabilizer is currently FDA approved for the management of BPSD. If a mood stabilizer is indicated for patients with dementia showing aggressive or agitated behavior, their use should only be considered in cases where the symptoms pose serious risk to the patient or their caregivers. Antipsychotics have the most data indicating some moderate efficacy for BPSD, but their use is associated with serious adverse events, like CVEs, and an increased mortality in the elderly. Carbamazepine also has reported mixed efficacy but is associated with poor tolerability and a risk of drug-drug interactions. Gabapentin, lamotrigine and levetiracetam may hold promise, but further research using placebo controlled trials are needed before recommendations can be made with these agents. Overall, no single pharmacologic agent has shown efficacy and tolerability in the elderly patient with BPSD. Their use should be carefully considered on an individual basis in patients with clearly identified target symptoms followed by close monitoring for improvement.",

The interviewer should also ask the parent whether these outbursts are unexpected or unusual, given their child's age. To meet the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must occur on average three or more times per week, and must be constant for 12 months or more, without a period of 3 months of normal mood. Moreover, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must have started before age 10, but not before age 6.",

Descriptions of the symptoms, as we have described throughout this book, and as spelled out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), serve as the point of departure—symptoms that are not just fleeting, but recurrent or persistent. The symptoms must also not be occurring exclusively and only in the context of some other condition, be it psychiatric, medical, or related to substance use. If, for example, the depersonalization happened only when the person was deeply depressed, or during a panic attack, or a seizure, or because a person has a brain tumor, he or she would not be diagnosed as having DPD. Likewise, regular substance users (daily drinkers or marijuana users) who experience depersonalization only in that context would not be diagnosed with DPD.",

      "abstract": "The term insight is a major concept in psychiatry, which nonetheless has a number of different connotations ranging from awareness of one’s disorder to achieving a clear and sudden solution of a problem or anosognosia. Although this concept is ubiquitous in the psychological literature, its definition is not clear, including in DSM-5; the most commonly used diagnostic system for mental disorders. This turns its use ambiguous, particularly for those who are not familiar with the historical background of the word. Here, we aim to a better understanding of insight in specific phobias and discuss the possible causes and implications in DSM-5 criterion changes. The historical analysis of this concept lead to conclude three main assumptions: 1) There are probably different etiopathogenic mechanisms subjacent to the deve lop ment of insight, anosognosia and possibly other “insight” related terms; 2) in the case of specific phobias, lack of insight is better seen and explained as a cognitive bias; 3) DSM use of an insight specifier for specific phobias could be of use; 4) lack of insight can be seen simply as a cognitive bias in most phobia cases.",

      "abstract": "In the nineties, Marin proposed to define apathy as a clinical syndrome due to a lack of motivation. The syndrome is characterized by a diminished goal-directed overt behaviors, a lack of interest or concern for social and personal activities and a lack of responsiveness to positive and negative events. Apathy is clearly distinct from depression and can be observed in many conditions, in healthy people as well as in psychiatric disorders such as depression or schizophrenia. It is very common in patients with brain lesions involving the frontal lobes, the right hemisphere, but also in degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Motivation, considered as the source of apathy by Marin, is not a simple construct. It refers to a complex set of multiple affective and cognitive processes. However, it is considered, either in an energetic acception, as a single quantitative variable, a force which impulses action but not direct behavior or, in a more specific acception, as the factor which direct behavior towards specific actions. The description of apathy by Marin and the scales designed to its assessment, are based on the first acception. The term apathy is only descriptive, such as those of dysphasia or anosognosia. They do not allow to study the mechanisms underlying the motivation disorders, essential process for the management of apathetic patients. A tentative qualitative approach to assess motivation disorders is proposed, using a semi-structured interview. However, it should be stressed that motivation can not be directly assessed: motivation is a concept to explain some behavior disorders and an inference from the study of behavior.",

Blood tests were taken and imaging was performed, which ruled out a structural lesion. A diagnosis of isolated benign episodic mydriasis was established. Unlike the typical presentation of the condition, the episodes did not occur in association with any form of migraine or headache.

Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

      "abstract": "Depression is a disorder of mood. Normally, our moods are in tune with events in our daily lives. These mood maladies are referred to as Affective Disorders. The noun affect refers to feelings, emotions and mood. The most common affective disorders are depression, which is characterized by low or depressed mood. This chapter discusses these and the bipolar disorders, which are often characterized by extreme mood swings from heightened elation or mania to deep depression, or vice versa. It talks about clinical features of major depressive disorder (MDD), its subtypes, stress, learned helplessness and the causes and treatments for depression. Current management of MDD involves the use of antidepressant drugs together with psychological treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy. Drugs that inhibit the synthesis of cortisol or inhibit the action of glutamate are presently under investigation for the use as antidepressant medication.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

Comatose patients normally maintain their eyes closed without evidence of opening spontaneously or to external stimuli, do not follow instructions, do not show goal-directed or voluntary conduct, do not speak and cannot sustain looking or tracking movements of more than a 45˚ angle. Excluded are secondary neurobehavioral signs and symptoms in coma that have been treated pharmacologically with sedatives. The definition of coma in terms of cerebral functioning refers to a state of acute brain failure not strictly related to any particular cerebral substratum or specific anatomical level of lesion. Coma normally occurs when broad areas in the upper and lower brain stems, or cerebral hemispheres, or simultaneously in the cerebral hemispheres and brain stem are damaged. The most frequent causes of coma are diffuse axonal pathology, hypoxia and secondary lesions which affect the brainstem (Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4).",

      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

If we avoid Cartesian dualism, the claim that mental disorders are biological is obviously a tautology. Given the facts above, psychiatric diagnostic manuals, such as the DSM and ICD, are school examples of what evidence-based science is not and represent nothing but a failed attempt to build a legal road from Health Care to Hell Care by over-medicalization and by the suffering of human and non-human animals.

      "title": "The clinical assessment of the patient with early dementia",
      "abstract": "ementia is a clinical state characterised by a loss of function in at least two cognitive domains.When making a diagnosis of dementia, features to look for include memory impairment and at least one of the following: aphasia, apraxia, agnosia and/or disturbances in executive functioning.To be significant the impairments should be severe enough to cause problems with social and occupational functioning and the decline must have occurred from a previously higher level.It is important to exclude delirium when considering such a diagnosis.When approaching the patient with a possible dementia, taking a careful history is paramount.Clues to the nature and aetiology of the disorder are often found following careful consultation with the patient and carer.A focused cognitive and physical examination is useful and the presence of specific features may aid in diagnosis.Certain investigations are mandatory and additional tests are recommended if the history and examination indicate particular aetiologies.It is useful when assessing a patient with cognitive impairment in the clinic to consider the following straightforward questions: c Is the patient demented?c If so, does the loss of function conform to a characteristic pattern?c Does the pattern of dementia conform to a particular pattern?c What is the likely disease process responsible for the dementia?An understanding of cognitive function and its anatomical correlates is necessary in order to ascertain which brain areas are affected.This, in turn, aids diagnosis.A discussion of the localisation of all cognitive processes is beyond the scope of this review.It is, however, particularly important to have an understanding of memory and its subdivisions, which is necessary to aid in differential diagnosis.We shall then illustrate how the history and examination, including bedside cognitive testing, are used in diagnosis. TYPES OF MEMORY cWhen considering any memory disorder it is important to have an understanding of the main ''types'' of memory; otherwise erroneous use of the term ''short term memory'' may cause confusion. 1Memory can be thought of in terms of working memory, episodic memory (anterograde and retrograde), semantic memory, remote memory, and implicit memory (table 1).Classically, early Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes defects in anterograde episodic memory (for example, the ability to remember an address after five minutes or longer). 2 The relevance of this is that aspects of memory are subserved by different structures.Certain disease processes have a tendency to start focally and progress in a typical anatomical pattern.They have, therefore, a largely predictable neuropsychological signature.For example, initially AD pathology tends to be perihippocampal, then spreads to temporo-parietal association cortex and latterly involves frontal lobes.This is mirrored by the initial cognitive deficit of anterograde episodic memory, progressing to attentional, semantic memory and visuo-perceptual impairment, with personality change occurring as a later feature. TAKING A HISTORY AND THE EXAMINATION OF THE MEMORY IMPAIRED PATIENTIt is vital to obtain a corroborating history from a relative or close friend in addition to the patient's account if they can provide one.The need to physically examine the patient, looking for signs pointing to a particular cause, is discussed below. History takingIt is useful to interview the patient and the accompanying person separately.The absence of a concerned relative or friend at the appointment may lessen the likelihood of dementia in a patient complaining of memory problems.Interviewing the patient separately enables the cooperation and language skills to be assessed without them being masked by interruptions or assistance from a third party.It also allows an assessment into the degree of insight of the affected individual.Conversation with the patient may be as important as any formal cognitive assessment.The presence of word finding difficulties, paraphasic errors, and inappropriate behaviour is helpful in v15",

OCD is disabling as to the time and mental energy it consumes. The disorder is characterized by repeated hand washing (the “Pontius Pilot Syndrome”), checking, and ordering. In some instances, these symptoms of OCD can have positive overtones and make a more productive and exacting worker. For example, dentist with OCD probably does more accurate restorations due to a “checker” inclination. Professions depending on industriousness and problem-solving like physician or scientist are custom-made for those with OCD. However, severe observable symptomology and often a dehabilitating decrease in functionality usually occur in those with the disorder. Nonetheless, those afflicted with OCD are quite skilled at hiding their symptoms from others; often including their employer or spouse. In addition, those with OCD usually have one or more depressive episodes or must also deal with chronic depression.

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

Diagnosis of major depression requires that the patient have at least 5 of 9 criterion symptoms (1 of which must be depressed mood or anhedonia) nearly every day for 2 or more weeks. Attracting somewhat less attention, dysthymia is a chronic disorder that manifests as depressive symptoms that persist more days than not for several years. Diagnosis of dysthymia does not require at least 5 symptoms, unlike major depression.

      "title": "A Case of Musical Hallucinations in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Aims: New onset psychosis in the elderly is rare with lifetime prevalence rates of 0.3–1%. Schizophrenia occurs in 0.1–0.5% of the elderly, however more common causes of new onset psychosis include dementia, delirium, drug-induced psychosis, and primary psychiatric disorders, most commonly depression. More than 50% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease experience psychotic symptoms and 70% develop delusions, in particular, persecutory type. Visual hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination occurring in 80% of patients with Lewy Body dementia. Second person auditory hallucinations occur in schizophrenia-like psychosis, however musical hallucinations where one perceives music without an external source are rare. Methods: An 84-year-old female patient with no psychiatric background reported a 2-month history of musical hallucinations, causing distress and poor sleep. Patient denied hearing voices and other modalities of hallucinations. The musical hallucinations were not lateralised to either ear or side of space but experienced as external. Delirium was ruled out and patient’s medications were screened for anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics. Patient had good cognition and a CT head excluded organic causes. The patient appeared distracted by the musical hallucinations, however, was not agitated and her mood was euthymic with congruent affect. No evidence of mood disorders ruled out psychotic depression and other affective disorders with psychotic symptoms. No thought disorders or delusions were present. Antipsychotics quetiapine and amisulpride proved no benefit for the patient. Results: The patient’s presentation showed no clear reversible pathology and was unresponsive to antipsychotics. Musical hallucinations was given as a diagnosis of exclusion. A musical hallucination is a type of auditory hallucination involving the perception of music without an external source. Patients are usually female, over 60 and subdivided into those with hyperacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication. Our patient was female and over 60 with presbycusis. Musical hallucinations are proposed to be due to abnormal autonomous activity in the auditory brain systems responsible for normal music imagery. Sensory auditory deprivation or acquired peripheral deafness leads to impoverished auditory input and spontaneous activity occurs within the network for the perception and imagery of music. Conclusion: This case report describes a rare phenomenon of musical hallucinations in an elderly patient. It identifies important diagnoses to exclude including delirium, dementia and other organic causes. The patient was female, over 60 yrs and diagnosed with presbycusis, characteristic of patients with musical hallucinations. The patient showed no improvement with antipsychotics and so treatment consisted of psychoeducation.",

      "abstract": "It is known that mood disorders in women explicitly relates to estrogen production. Except for these findings phenomenon as Premenstrual Syndrome and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, directly connected to menstrual cycle in women, is widely discussed. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a set of subjectively unpleasant mental and somatic symptoms. It appears in luteal phase of ovarian cycle. During menstruation it remits and disappears up to one week from its termination. DSM IV classified PMDD into the category of \"Other specific depressive disorders\" and further revision DSM IV-TR classifies PMDD as a separate strictly defined psychiatric diagnosis. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) does not include any specific category as PMDD or similar. The closest category F38.8 does not represent the core of the phenomenon because it relates only to general depressive symptomatology and does not give specific diagnostic criteria to menstrual cycle related mood disorders (Grady-Weliky, 2003). In the presented article, possible effectivity of PMDD treatment with the focus to antidepressants of SSRI type (Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors) is discussed. In spite of interesting and significant findings, the treatment of PMDD and accordingly PMS is above all multidisciplinary question and it must be treated like that.",

A major depressive episode is characterised by a coffee mood or associate degree inability to expertise pleasure (anhedonia), or both, for quite two weeks, combined with many psychological feature and vegetative symptoms and therefore the incidence of distress or impairment. A identification of major clinical depression will be created if someone suffers a minimum of one such episode (without ever experiencing mania). However, most of the people with major clinical depression have multiple episodes. Significantly, many medical diseases like polygenic disorder, heart condition, response disorders and pain square measure common comorbid diagnoses.

Diagnostic criteria for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2000; the American Psychiatric Association had previously established very specific diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Both diagnoses require 2 months of prospective symptom ratings, which can be accomplished using forms designed by individual clinicians or employing 1 of a number of validated instruments. The patient will need to provide a complete family and personal history of mental disorders and medical diseases. A thorough physical examination and certain basic laboratory tests should either identify or rule out many potential causes of the symptoms. The diseases, disorders or situations considered in the differential diagnosis of PMS and PMDD will depend on the woman's presenting symptoms. Many women with a bothersome or debilitating premenstrual disorder go undiagnosed, either because they do not report their symptoms to a clinician or because the clinician has difficulty diagnosing the disorder.",

      "title": "Poor insight in psychosis and meta-representation models",
      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

      "abstract": "• Little is known of factors that, on an individual basis, confer vulnerability to the emergence of involuntary movements (tardive dyskinesia) during long-term neuroleptic treatment. In this study of 88 chronic schizophrenic inpatients, 22 variables (four demographic, 14 medication history, and four features of illness) were compared for any association(s) with the presence, by differing topographies and criteria of abnormality, and severity of involuntary movements. Irrespective of the criterion used, the presence of marked cognitive dysfunction—muteness bore a consistent and highly significant primary association with both the presence and the overall severity of orofacial dyskinesia; no such association was found in relation to the presence of limb-truncal dyskinesia. Flattening of affect was the only other variable consistently associated with the presence of orofacial movements. The reliability and prominence of the association between the presence of orofacial, but not of limb-truncal, movements and cognitive dysfunction—negative symptoms suggest that these varying topographies may not constitute a unitary syndrome. This strong association, not with indexes of neuroleptic exposure but rather with features of the illness for which that treatment was prescribed, suggests some neurologic process, more subtle than may previously have been appreciated, as a vulnerability factor of some importance. In schizophrenia it appears to be intimately related to the disease process.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

      "title": "A Rare Case of Non Convulsive Status Epileptic with Psychotic Presentation",
      "abstract": "Background Psychosis associated with epilepsy is one of the temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy (TFLE) forms of presentation. Non-convulsive epileptic status (NCSE) clinical features are subtle and non-specific and, consequently, they are generally not diagnosed and confused with behavioral or psychiatric disorders. It remains a challenge to characterize neurobiological changes that contribute to the genesis or maintenance of both conditions, with a clear need for further investigation. Case report A 56-year-old male patient was hospitalized due to a one month period with persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, thought diffusion, passivity phenomena and total insomnia. There were no relevant changes in the general and neurological physical examinations, analytical study, urine’s substance abuse drugs and cerebral CT. His psychotic symptoms diminished with paliperidone, but one month after his admission he began to present periods of confusion, consciousness floating, temporal and spatial disorientation, disperse attention, behavioral disorganization at night and ataxia. He realized an electroencephalogram (EEG) and had practically continued epileptic activity in the temporal and frontal lobes, which ceased with the addition of valproic acid (VPA). Four months later the patient was discharged, medicated with paliperidone and VPA, with no psychotic symptomatology. Conclusions Today the most accepted theory is that both Psychosis and Epilepsy are the consequence of underlying neuropath physiological dysfunction, going towards the specter of a Psychosis’s “continuum”. The NCES can have a variety of clinical presentations and the EEG is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis, but this can be difficult especially due to its low availability and because there is currently no consensus on the EEG diagnostic criteria. This clinical case was particularly challenging and the diagnostic delay could represent a liability to the patient’s recovery. In both pathologies, the treatment remains a challenge for psychiatrists and neurologists, and further studies are needed to clarify the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents from city and voluntary services who had been diagnosed as having conduct disorder were compared with psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents who had never been so diagnosed. There were no significant symptomatic differences. The major factor distinguishing adolescents ever diagnosed as having conduct disorder was violence, regardless of other symptoms. The most common discharge diagnosis of those who had formerly been diagnosed as having conduct disorder was schizophrenia. However, even violence did not distinguish those discharged with a diagnosis of conduct disorder from those whose diagnoses were subsequently changed. With its focus on manifest behaviors and its lack of clear exclusionary criteria, the conduct disorder diagnosis obfuscates other potentially treatable neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Status epilepticus (SE) is a prolonged, self-sustained seizure that can manifest as a prolonged convulsion, subtle facial or limb twitching, or simply altered mental status, always in association with a persistent electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure pattern. In clinical trials, convulsive seizures lasting longer than 5 min are often treated as SE,1 whereas epidemiological studies have defined 30 min of continuous convulsive seizures or intermittent seizures without recovery of consciousness as SE.2 There are 126,000 to 195,000 episodes of SE associated with 22,000 to 42,000 deaths each year in the United States when SE is defined as 30 min of seizures.2 As many as 50% of patients older than 65 years of age who suffer from SE die within 30 days of the episode. Although mortality is far less common in younger patients, they are at risk for neurological morbidity, such as injury to the hippocampus3 and neuropsychological dysfunction.4 Prolonged seizures can also lead to significant systemic complications, including pulmonary congestion and edema, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, elevation of body temperature, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and rhabdomylosis. These systemic complications tend to worsen as more seizures occur.5 It has long been recognized that SE is a dynamic and rapidly evolving condition.5,6 Ongoing seizures rapidly modify neuronal activity and synaptic function.7 This rapid neuronal plasticity is manifest in changes in behavioral seizures, EEG patterns, sensitivity to drugs, and evolution of neuronal injury and death. Although these changes are continuous, it is convenient to divide SE into stages for the purposes of investigation and treatment (Table 41–1).",

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is a symptom whose causes are protean and whose phenotype includes physical, mood, and behavioral components. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.",

This test consists of two subtests, one with associative distractors and the other without distractors, which are matched on discriminating power and thus permit the assessment of differential specific performance deficit uncontaminated by the generalized deficit characteristic of many patient groups. Results indicated that some susceptibility to associative intrusions characterizes all groups of long-term patients regardless of diagnosis. Short-term patients (with the possible exception of schizophrenic) did not show such heightened susceptibility. Lengthy illness and/or stay in hospital are apparently implicated in at least this form of thought disorder, which has been often considered to be a uniquely schizophrenic phenomenon.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "abstract": "The term \"theory of mind\" (ToM) refers to the capacity to infer one's own and other persons' mental states (e.g. their beliefs, feelings, intentions or knowledge). It was found that children in the autistic spectrum have deficits in ToM. One of the suggestions was that unlike autistic people, ToM skills are normally developed in schizophrenia patients, but \"lost\" in the first psychotic episode. The deficit may disappear on remission from the acute phase, as described in some studies. A substantial body of research has highlighted the impaired ToM in schizophrenia. There is good empirical evidence that ToM is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms--for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms--may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others' intentions. However, it is still under debate how an impaired ToM in schizophrenia is associated with other aspects of cognition, how the impairment fluctuates with acuity or chronicity of the schizophrenic disorder, and if it is a state or trate marker.

Panic attacks within panic disorder are not caused by physical illness or certain substances and they are unexpected, at least initially; later in the course of the disorder, many attacks may be precipitated by certain situations or are more likely to occur in them. Anticipatory anxiety is an intense fear of having another panic attack, which is present between panic attacks. Some patients with panic disorder go on to develop agoraphobia, usually defined as fear and/or avoidance of the situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help might not be available in case of a panic attack; in such cases, patients are diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia. Those who do not develop agoraphobia receive a diagnosis of panic disorder without agoraphobia. Components of panic disorder are presented in Figure 2—1. Patients with agoraphobia who have no history of panic disorder or whose agoraphobia is not related at least to panic attacks or symptoms of panic attacks are relatively rarely encountered in clinical practice. The diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder has been a matter of some controversy, especially in view of the differences between American and European psychiatrists (and the DSM and ICD diagnostic and classification systems) in the conceptualization of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia. The conceptualization adhered to here has for the most part been derived from the DSM system, as there is more empirical support for it. Although panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) is a relatively well-defined psychopathological entity whose treatment is generally rewarding, there are important, unresolved issues. They are listed below and discussed throughout this chapter. …1. Are there different types of panic attacks based on the absence or presence of the context in which they appear (i.e., unexpected vs. situational attacks)? Should the ‘‘subtyping’’ of panic attacks be based on other criteria (e.g., symptom profile)? 2. Because panic attacks are not specific for panic disorder, should they continue to be the main feature of panic disorder? Can panic attacks occurring as part of panic disorder be reliably distinguished from panic attacks occurring as part of other disorders or in the absence of any psychopathology? 3. What is the relationship between panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia?",

Hypochondriasis is distinguished from other somatic delusional disorders because this disorder is associated with the experience of physical symptoms experienced by the sufferer, whereas other somatoform disorders do not show physical symptoms in themselves. Symptoms that arise may be an exaggerated statement of physical symptoms, which will actually exacerbate physical symptoms caused by the belief that the patient is sick and in a worse condition than the actual situation. Treatment of hypochondriasis includes recording symptoms, psychosocial review, and psychotherapy. Good prognosis is associated with high socioeconomic status, sudden onset, absence of personality disorders and absence of concomitant non-psychiatric medical conditions.",

      "abstract": "The name schizophrenia comes from a combination of the Greek words shizeiu - to split and fren - reason. Eugen Bleuler has introduced the name schizophrenia in 1991 and the goal was to replace the negative meaning of the disease. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that does not allow a sick person to distinguish the real from the unreal experience, interferes with daily thinking and emotional experiences towards others and disrupts normal social functioning. The symptoms that occur in this disease are delusions, hallucinations, illusions, disorganization and impoverishment of mental functions. The symptoms of the disease are divided into positive and negative. The disease occurs between the ages of 15 and 35, and we recognize it by its early symptoms, sometimes these symptoms are absent, so the disease is noticed only in the acute phase, only the beginning of the disease is gradual or sudden. The diagnosis of schizophrenia requires that the patient's symptoms be present for at least six months and that there is a prodromal phase that lasts for another 5 months, with some symptoms maintaining, but in a milder form. Schizophrenia is treated with drugs, but they are not enough to achieve the highest possible level of independence in patients later in life, so psychosocial methods are also used. It is of great importance to involve the patient's family, environment and community in the treatment process so that the return to normal life and recovery is as fast and high quality as possible. Schizophrenia is the most stigmatized mental illness, it is caused by prejudice, stigmatization entails discrimination, which ultimately has negative consequences for the patient and his family. A nurse is the person who spends the most time with a patient with schizophrenia, so she is the only one who can notice problems in the field of health care. Nursing documentation is also of great importance and the first step in patient care. To solve the problem, the nurse selects the most appropriate nursing interventions that are patient-centered and individualized for himself. A good and quality relationship of trust between the nurse and the patient is the most important characteristic of quality health care.",

Comorbid anxious features often complicate the recognition of depression and may herald a poor prognosis. We report the results of a cross-sectional naturalistic study to determine the impact of three interventions (no antidepressant, fluoxetine, or tricyclic antidepressant therapy) on relative risk of work days lost in 454 French outpatients with either major or minor depression. Most depressed patients also manifested anxious features (76% with a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score ≥ 12). The presence of anxiety was related to the severity of depression, work absenteeism, and current social instability. Depression severity (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ≤ 26, including the contributions of anxious symptoms), psychiatric comorbidity, and psychomotor retardation best predicted continued work absenteeism. Patients with major depression were more likely to receive an antidepressant if they had a past history of depressive episodes and/or previous work disability. Patients with minor depression were less likely to receive drug therapy than patients with major depression, despite their current work disability. Among patients who received fluoxetine or a tricyclic antidepressant for at least 8 weeks, fluoxetine was associated with statistically significantly lower mean anxiety and depression scores and fewer work days missed.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa – reciprocal relationships. A literature review",
      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

      "title": "What Are Realistic Treatment Goals? Lingering Symptoms Require You to Evaluate Pharmacotherapy and Offer Psychosocial Interventions",
      "abstract": "The course of chronic psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, differs from chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes. Some patients with chronic psychiatric conditions achieve remission and become symptom-free, while others continue to have lingering signs of disease for life. Residual symptoms of schizophrenia are not fully defined in the literature, which poses a challenge because they are central in the overall treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. (1) During this phase of schizophrenia, patients continue to have symptoms after psychosis has subsided. These patients might continue to have negative symptoms such as social and emotional withdrawal and low energy. Although frank psychotic behavior has disappeared, the patient might continue to hold strange beliefs. Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment option for psychiatric conditions, but the psychosocial aspect may have greater importance when treating residual symptoms and patients with chronic psychiatric illness. (2) A naturalistic study in Germany evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of residual symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. (3) The authors used a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale symptom severity score >1 for those purposes, which is possibly a stringent criterion to define residual symptoms. This multicenter study enrolled 399 individuals age 18 to 65 with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. (3) Of the 236 patients achieving remission at discharge, 94% had at least 1 residual symptom and 69% had at least 4 residual symptoms. Therefore, residual symptoms were highly prevalent in remitted patients. The most frequent residual symptoms were: * blunted affect * conceptual disorganization * passive or apathetic social withdrawal * emotional withdrawal * lack of judgment and insight * poor attention * somatic concern * difficulty with abstract thinking * anxiety * poor rapport. (3) Of note, positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinatory behavior, were found in remitted patients at discharge (17% and 10%, respectively). The study concluded that the severity of residual symptoms was associated with relapse risk and had an overall negative impact on the outcome of patients with schizophrenia. (3) The study noted that residual symptoms may be greater in number or volume than negative symptoms and questioned the origins of residual symptoms because most were present at baseline in more than two-third of patients. Patients with residual symptoms of schizophrenia usually are older and therefore present specific management challenges for clinicians. Changes associated with aging, such as medical problems, cognitive deficits, and lack of social support, could create new care needs for this patient population. Although the biopsychosocial model used to treat chronic psychiatric conditions, especially schizophrenia, is preferred, older schizophrenia patients with residual symptoms often need more psychosocial interventions compared with young adults with schizophrenia. Managing residual symptoms in schizophrenia Few studies are devoted to pharmacological treatment of older adults with schizophrenia, likely because pharmacotherapy for older patients with schizophrenia can be challenging. Evidence-based treatment is based primarily on findings from younger patients who survived into later life. Clinicians often use the adage of geriatric psychiatry, start low, go slow, because older patients are susceptible to adverse effects associated with psychiatric medications, including cardiovascular, metabolic, anticholinergic, and extrapyramidal effects, orthostasis, sedation, falls, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Older patients with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and anticholinergic adverse effects, perhaps because of degeneration of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. …",

      "abstract": "Malingering, also called shamming illness or goldbricking, is the false and fraudulent simulation or exaggeration of physical or mental disease or defect, performed in order to obtain money or drugs or to evade duty or criminal responsibility, or for other reasons that may be readily understood by an objective observer from the individual's circumstances, rather than from learning the individual's psychology. Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

Moreover, there is a growing evidence that patients with CFS belong to an inhomogeneous group with different etiologic constellations. Specific somatic factors, e.g. viruses, seem to be less important for onset than certain personality-traits like depressiveness and workaholism. These traits lead to an increased vulnerability to unspecific psychological or biological stressors that may cause chronic fatigue by complex psychosomatic interferences. Concerning diagnosis, there are no specific methods or results available, the same is true for pharmacological treatment. As a consequence, practitioners should be aware not to miss a somatic disease causing fatigue, and, parallel to this, start right from the beginning talking about the psychosomatic background of CFS. Furthermore, psychotherapy has shown to be effective in CFS.",

Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt.

Psychotically depressed patients respond poorly to antidepressants, but remission is likely with neuroleptic-antidepressant combinations or electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotic depression may be unipolar or bipolar with early or late onset and may be more likely to occur in patients with a history of childhood psychic trauma. Much is known about the course and treatment response of obvious presentations of psychotic depression, but more must be learned about depressed patients who have intermittent, subtle, or mild psychotic symptoms and about the ways in which the capacity to become psychotic interacts with the capacity to become depressed to produce a syndrome greater than the sum of its parts.",

      "title": "M6. REDUCED READINESS POTENTIAL AS A NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE OF SELF-DISTURBANCES IN EARLY–COURSE PSYCHOSIS: PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM A HIGH–DENSITY EEG STUDY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Self-disturbances reflect a core dimension of Schizophrenia that can be identified before disease onset and might underlie the development of typical psychotic symptoms. The Sense of Agency (SoA) can be conceptualized as the pre-reflective sensation of being the one who is causing or generating an action or thought. Passivity phenomena, such as the reported feeling and belief that one’s thoughts or actions are generated and/or controlled by an external agent, are exquisite examples of SoA disturbances observed in Schizophrenia. Despite intensive research, the neurobiological pathogenetic mechanisms underlying such disturbances remain unclear. Among several putative neurophysiological brain abnormalities, a reduction of the Bereitschaftspotential, also called pre-motor or Readiness Potential (RP), was described in chronic, medicated patients with Schizophrenia. Given its anticipation of voluntary movement by 1 – 2 seconds over the motor cortex and supplementary motor area contralateral to the effector, RP has previously been proposed to be a neural signature of volition to initiate movement. Interestingly, higher RPs among healthy subjects have been recently associated with stronger intentional binding, suggesting increased SoA in subjects exhibiting stronger premovement activity. The objective of our work was to study RP abnormalities in patients with a psychotic illness of recent onset and to relate them to self disturbances, in order to clarify the relationship between known neurophysiological and psychopathological abnormalities. Methods We employed high-density electroencephalography (64-channel BrainAmp, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) to record scalp potentials during a self-paced movement task in a group of seven early–course psychosis patients (mean age = 24,5, range 20–33) and an equal group of age– and gender– matched (mean age =25,3, range 19 – 36) healthy control subjects. Patients were recruited during an acute stage of their disorder requiring hospitalization and were treated with low–dose atypical antipsychotics. Exclusion criteria included major medical or neurological illness affecting the CNS and any intellectual developmental disorder. Several parameters related to the elicited RP were recorded, including maximum amplitude and slope. The Examination of Anomalous Self Experience (EASE) scale was chosen to assess Self disturbances in the patient group by an experienced clinician who was blind to the neurophysiological outcome. Results RP was found to be reduced in patients, compared to healthy control subjects, in both its amplitude and slope (p &amp;lt; 0,005) despite comparable EMG activity. EASE scores of items ‘EASE-10’ (a comprehensive item that reflect most prototypically the disorders of self-experience) and ‘EASE-2’ (“Self-Awareness”) appeared to increase monotonically with the decrease of RP slope (p &amp;lt; 0,05). Discussion Our preliminary data show that disturbances of RP are present since the early course of psychotic disorders. They also suggest that such abnormalities may reflect the severity of self-disturbances in these patients. If confirmed in a larger, medication-naïve samples, our findings might clarify the underlying neural mechanisms of such abnormalities and provide a solid basis for further investigation of RP disturbances as an early biological marker for Schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",

The exceptions are those which mimic psychopathology: akathesia and akinisia. Akathesia resembles anxiety. Akinesia is similar to depression, residual schizophrenia, and demoralization. Differential diagnosis may require interruption of the neuroleptic. Whether neuroleptics can cause depression not associated with akinesia has never been established. The first obligation of the clinician is to be sure that the depressive symptoms are not concomitants of akinesia, before treating with antidepressants which may not be the appropriate treatment. There is no convincing evidence that one neuroleptic drug is more likely to cause akinesia than another, although this had not been studied extensively using a broad definition of akinesia.",

There is, I think, a misunderstanding regarding the importance of this diagnosis that may affect future research adversely. In developing criteria for the diagnosis of MDE, the framers of the<i>DSM-III</i>were not trying to limit excessive diagnosis, as was the case with schizophrenia. They included as criteria symptoms that persons with clinically diagnosed depression often manifest. Unfortunately, however, there are few severity requirements for the<i>DSM-III</i>diagnostic criteria of MDE. Poor appetite \"nearly every day for a period of at least two weeks,\" for example, is sufficient, though the poor appetite may range from mild, without weight loss, to very severe. Similarly, there are no severity criteria for insomnia, loss of energy, difficulty concentrating, etc. Thus, a large number of very mild depressives",

The time has come to link the classification of depression with rational treatment, but before offering a scheme to do this, a brief consideration of the inadequacies of existing terminology may help to explain the need for a new scheme.",

According to the DSM‐IV‐R, diagnostic criteria include(1) a preoccupation with an imagined or slight appearance defect; if slight defect is apparent, the person's concern is extreme; (2) the preoccupation results in significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning; and (3) the preoccupation is not due to another psychiatric disorder (e.g., anorexia nervosa). A diagnosis of Delusional Disorder, Somatic Type can also be applied to persons who hold their distorted beliefs with delusional intensity. BDD is currently categorized as Somatoform Disorder, although it has been argued that it is more appropriately classified as an obsessive‐compulsive spectrum disorder or an affective spectrum disorder.",

      "title": "Il trattamento a lungo termine della Depressione Unipolare: focus sulla terapia con Venlafaxina RP",
      "abstract": "Depression is the most common of all the major mental illnesses with one year prevalence in European countries of around 5%, and with a range from 3.1% to 10.1%. Depressive Episodes are associated with disability and frequently have a long duration: in one third of patients the episode will last for more than 2 years, the criteria for chronic depression. Recurrence is predicted by a number of factors including severity of depression, number of prior episodes, time since previous episode and absence of remission or presence of subsyndromal symptoms. The likelihood of recurrence increases with the number of previous episodes and the severity of the current episode: once a patient has suffered from three episodes of depression, he has more than 95% chance of having another. Although effective pharmacotherapeutic agents are available, depressed patients are often undertreated or treated for an inadequate period of time. Initial acute treatment of Major Depression results in a significant lessening of depressive symptoms (response) progressing to absence of depressive symptoms (remission) which means the return to the patient’s premorbid state. Stable remission for 46 months is thought of as a recovery. A worsening of symptoms or the return of a major depression is considered a relapse before recovery has been achieved and recurrence if it occurs later. The distinction between remission vs. recovery and relapse vs. recurrence is not possible. The three phases of treatment are: acute therapy; continuation therapy; maintenance therapy. The acute phase of therapy covers the time period from the beginning of treatment to remission, which is the primary therapeutic goal. The continuation phase follows the acute phase to preserve and stabilize the remission. It is the phase in which the treatment is extended for a period of time in order to prevent a return of depression. Long-term maintenance treatment is aimed at the prevention of a new episode of depression. Long-term tolerability is, therefore, important in facilitating adherence to treatment and thereby control over depressive symptoms. The new Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inihibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin Noradrenaline Reuptake Inihibitors (SNRIs) are generally better tolerated than older treatments, such as Tricyclic antidepressants and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors. Venlafaxine XR, with its dual action of serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition, has been shown to be superior in efficacy to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors for severe Majors Depressive Disorder. Clinical studies suggests that it has a rapid onset of action, producing significant clinical improvement in the first or second week of treatment, and long-term efficacy and may have consistently superior remission rates compared with the SSRIs. Moreover Venlafaxine XR (extended release) was effective in 92% of depressed patients in preventing recurrence in the second year of maintenance therapy (Prevent Study).",

Such acts persisted for 2 to l0 minutes despite forceful external interruption in three single, white male loners. In contrast, five nonusers, with otherwise similar symptomatology, aborted their homicidal attacks on external interruption, in a previously proposed syndrome with only experiential kindling with memory revival of past hurts in limbic psychotic trigger reaction.

      "abstract": "Delirium Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness (awareness of the person' s environment) characterized by altered or shifting mental status and inattention (reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention).There are also changes in cognition (basic mental functions) such as memory impairment, disorientation to time or place, and language disturbance.There also may be disturbances of perception (accurate appreciation of the environment) such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not actually there), abnormal speech, abnormal movements (including tremors or picking at clothing), disruptive or violent behavior, and sudden shifts in emotions.To qualify for a diagnosis of delirium, the signs and symptoms must have a short onset (over a period of hours or days) and change over the course of the day.It is important to make a clear distinction between delirium and dementia (such as Alzheimer disease).Dementia is a disturbance in intellectual (thinking) functions that is usually gradually progressive over a long period.Having delirium along with another medical illness can significantly increase a person' s chance of dying from that illness.It is important for doctors to identify delirium so that it can be treated to improve the person' s overall prognosis.The December 24/31, 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about agitation and delirium at the end of life.This Patient Page is based on one previously published in the April 14, 2004, issue of JAMA.",

      "title": "Guidelines for treating depressive illness with antidepressants: A statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common illness which affects some 3% of the population per year. At least 25% of those with marked depression do not consult their general practitioner and in half of those who do the illness is not detected. Depression is easy to recognize when four or five of the core symptoms have been present for 2 weeks which often coincides with some occupational and social impairment. The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame and suicidal thoughts. A diagnosis of depression is made when five of these core symptoms, one of which should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, have been present for 2 weeks. Four core symptoms are probably sufficient. Response to antidepressants is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or very mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to antidepressants is more uncertain. Antidepressants are effective, they are not addictive and do not lose efficacy with prolonged use. The newer antidepressants have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, they are better tolerated and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. They are less cardiotoxic and are safer in overdose. Antidepressants should be used at full therapeutic doses. Treatment failure is often due to too low a dose being used in general practice. It may be difficult to reach the right dose with the older tricyclics because of side effects. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 months after the patient is apparently well. Stopping the treatment before this is ill-advised as the partially treated depression frequently returns. Most depression is recurrent. Long-term antidepressant treatment is effective in reducing the risk of new episodes of depression and should be continued to keep the patient well.",

Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

Anterograde amnesia arose within a 1-month period and has persisted for more than 1 year.

      "abstract": "The majority of first-episode psychoses are preceded by a prodromal phase that is several years on average, frequently leads to some decline in psychosocial functioning and offers the opportunity for early detection within the framework of an indicated prevention. To this, two approaches are currently mainly followed. The ultra-high-risk (UHR) criteria were explicitly developed to predict first-episode psychosis within 12 months, and indeed the majority of conversions in clinical UHR samples seem to occur within the first 12 months of initial assessment. Their main criterion, the attenuated psychotic symptoms criterion, captures symptoms that resemble positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) with the exception that some level of insight is still maintained, and these frequently compromise functioning already. In contrast, the basic symptom criteria try to catch patients at increased risk of psychoses at the earliest possible time, i.e. ideally when only the first subtle disturbances in information processing have developed that are experienced with full insight and do not yet overload the person's coping abilities, and thus have not yet resulted in any functional decline. First results from prospective studies not only support this view, but indicate that the combination of both approaches might be a more favorable way to increase sensitivity and detect risk earlier, as well as to establish a change-sensitive risk stratification approach.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "GAD is defined as anxiety, tension or worry associated with a considerable number of patients displaying a mix of somatic and psychological symptoms. The diagnostic definitions of GAD in various manuals, including ICD-10 and DSM-III/IV, differ in quality, number of symptoms, time frames and exclusion criteria. Consequently, lifetime prevalence rates vary between 1.2 and 6.4% in epidemiological surveys (). Although the diagnostic reliability of GAD is comparatively low, the features constituting the diagnostic criteria have been noted to be reliable (). A study that compared the distribution of somatic symptoms associated with GAD in patients with \"pure\" GAD and patients with GAD plus comorbid current or lifetime psychiatric diagnoses showed that GAD is a distinct disorder that is relatively consistent in presentation in patients with or without other psychiatric disorders (). The hypothesis of the existence of distinct subtypes of GAD, i.e. a \"pure\" GAD and a \"secondary\" type with comorbid disorder, representing possibly a prodromal/residual state or an epiphenomenon associated with another disorder, was therefore not confirmed.",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

Depression of middle age is subdivided depending on the predomination of one or another disorder in the clinical picture. There are simple depression and complicated depression with additional psychopathological symptoms. The most difficult is to diagnose depression with onset in early childhood, including infant's age, when the psychopathological presentations depend on the consequences of the perinatal CNS lesion, maternal deprivation and other factors. In children, the clinical picture of depression differs by syndromologic incompleteness, peculiarity of phenomenological presentations and polymorphism of disorders. In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms. Depression with late age at onset differs by the abundance of somatic and hypochondriac complaints, anxiety and depressive delusion accompanied by the transitory aggravation of cognitive impairment (depressive pseudodementia).",

The report also supports my feeling, however, that this trend often leads one into a confusing area that is neither psychiatric or neurologic. Based on the case report, the evidence to support complex partial epilepsy is much less than satisfactory. The episodes last approximately three hours and as long as 24 hours, rather long for seizures. They are said to have \"aura-like\" phases that last as long as four hours. They are not followed by any confusion, and they are characterized by goal-directed destructive behavior as part of the ictal period. These features are all highly atypical of temporal lobe seizures. Further, the inability to obtain an abnormal EEG and the response of these \"seizures\"",

If the parent endorsed a Major Depressive Episode, the interviewer should inquire whether these symptoms occurred during the same 2-week period. If criteria are met for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. If the child's symptoms do not meet the full criteria for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, NOS. These children may have typical bipolar symptoms but not the DSM-5 required duration. In addition, these children may be characterized by severe irritability, aggressiveness, agitation, and/or mood lability. There may also be more rapid cycling of mood.",

The concept of mind and associated mood states defended here is that they are physically emergent, subjective, qualitative, unified features of the brain. We compared our neurobiological assessment also to psychoanalytical practice (first person's perspective). Argument Applied to recent work on major depressive disorder ( MDD ), our ideas are among other supported by clinical and experimental studies on sleep deprivation, deep brain stimulation and epidemiological assessments of time‐to‐recovery. Clinical implications We suggest that depression is a transient state of the brain, that is mutually exclusive to the state of pleasure (in the F reudian context), rather than a disorder or disease with a characteristic time course (like many reversible somatic diseases). MDD can best be described with stochastic transition models, which is discussed in the context of a presumed brain serotonin dysfunction in depression. Our ideas invite a reconsideration of some concepts underlying current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

      "title": "The “Endless Trip”: Psychopathology and psychopharmacology in the Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD)",
      "abstract": "Introduction Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) is a syndrome characterized by prolonged or reoccurring perceptual symptoms, reminiscent of acute hallucinogen effects. HPPD was associated with a broader range of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide)-like substances, including cannabis, MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), psilocybin, mescaline and other psychostimulants. Symptomatology mainly comprises visual disorders (i.e., geometric pseudo-hallucinations, halos, flashes of colours/lights, motion-perception deficits, afterimages, micropsy, more acute awareness of floaters, etc.), even though depressive symptoms and thought disorders may be comorbidly present. Objective Although HPPD was firstly described in 1954, it was definitely established as a syndrome in 2000 with the revised forth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). However, neuronal substrate, risk factors, aetiology and pathogenesis of HPPD remains still unknown and under investigation. Furthermore, there are still open questions about its pharmacological targets. Aims A critical review on psychopathological bases, etiological hypothesis and psychopharmacological approaches towards HPPD was here provided.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most disabling and persistent form of severe mental illness. It is generally\nconsidered a disease related to brain abnormalities caused by a range of specific genetic and/or\nenvironmental factors (Tandon, Keshavan, & Nasrallah, 2008a). Its annual incidence averages 15\nper 100,000, and the risk of developing the illness over one’s lifetime is approximately 0.7%\n(Tandon, Keshavan, & Nasrallah, 2008b). The usual presentation in late adolescence/early\nadulthood places incredible demands on individuals, their families, and society itself. The symptoms of schizophrenia can be divided into positive and negative symptoms because of their impact\non diagnosis and treatment, although it is important to highlight that the range and nature of\nsymptoms vary widely between individuals (USDHHS, 1999). Positive symptoms are those that\nappear to reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions and are manifested in symptoms such\nas delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorder. Negative symptoms are those that appear to\nreflect a reduction or loss of normal functions and reflect symptoms such as affective flattening,\napathy, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairments.",

      "abstract": "Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) results in altered motor, sensory and cognitive function in the absence of evident organic disease.It often co-occurs alongside dissociative disorders and dissociation has been found to be high in patients across FND subtypes (particularly in those with Non-Epileptic Attack Disorder; NEADs).However, the presence of dissociation in FND is varied and there are contradictory definitions and suggestions for elevated levels.Here, three studies show that dissociation is a prominent, defining feature of people with FND compared to those who are healthy or have other, similar long-term health conditions, and that this heightened dissociation is not explained by a history of trauma (study 1, N = 121), mood (study 2, N = 589) and is not associated with social isolation/social exclusion (study 3, N = 542).As dissociation appeared to occur in FND in the absence of the usual contributing factors, and as higher levels of dissociation were associated with increased disability and illness impacts, understanding its role is of fundamental importance to developing our understanding of FND.These findings have further applications, beyond the theoretical, in clinical settings and in research; the implications for further research are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is considered one of the leading psychiatric disorders due to its\r\n incidence of 1% in the general population. Due to its many presentations it can not be defined as\r\n a single entity, but rather a disorder with heterogeneous genetic, neurobiological, environmental\r\n and social background, manifested by a series of cognitive, behavioral and emotional deviations,\r\n which speaks in favor that there are no two identical clinical presentations of schizophrenia.\r\n Schizophrenia is also a chronic disorder, requiring long-term care. Because of its long duration,\r\n insufficiently known etiology, behavioral changes and alterations of psychic functions, and the\r\n fact that it most commonly occurs during late adolescence, schizophrenia significantly impairs\r\n work and social functionality of the affected individual and has a negative impact on both the\r\n quality of life of the patient and the patient’s family, health system and society in general.\r\n What has recently caught the field’s attention is the presence of comorbid somatic\r\n diseases in patients with schizophrenia who have not yet been adequately diagnosed and treated.\r\n One of the most common and severely debilitating is the metabolic syndrome. It is a syndrome\r\n consisting of a series of metabolic abnormalities that result from a number of factors, such as:\r\n inadequate nutrition, lack of physical activity and smoking, the effects of the psychotic disorder\r\n itself, as well as the potentially adverse effects of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.\r\n The term metabolic syndrome implies abdominal or central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia with\r\n lowered HDL-cholesterol, hypertension and hyperglycemia. If these metabolic disorders occur at\r\n the same time, the patient is at increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and the\r\n development of type II diabetes. Cardiovascular disease, along with suicide, is the most important\r\n cause of mortality in patients with schizophrenia. Metabolic abnormalities are known to be\r\n associated with chronic course of the disorder and long-term administration of certain\r\n antipsychotics. However, there is a possibility that metabolic parameters are impaired at the\r\n outset of the disorder, that is, when the first diagnosis of schizophrenia is made. That is in fact the\r\n main hypothesis of this research. The aim of the study was to prospectively examine and analyze the values of the\r\n aforementioned metabolic parameters and to determine if the metabolic syndrome is present in\r\n 30 subjects with the first episode of schizophrenia. Those values were compared with those of\r\n other 30 subjects, who were previously diagnosed with schizophrenia and another 30 subjects,\r\n who were not diagnosed with the disorder (healthy individuals). This study was conducted at the\r\n Clinic for Psychiatry of the UHC Sestre milosrdnice. For the purpose of the study, laboratory\r\n values of serum lipids and glucose, anthropometric measures, and the existence of nicotine\r\n dependence in the subjects were analyzed.\r\n The study did not confirm the hypothesis that metabolic parameters are abnormal at\r\n the very beginning of the disorder, when the diagnosis of schizophrenia is made for the first time\r\n in patients’ lives. The present parameters do not meet the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of\r\n metabolic disorder in patients with the first episode of schizophrenia.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

      "title": "Specific Phobia vs Panic Disorder in Children: A Unique Case Report and Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Specific phobia is defined as marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear and anxiety, is actively avoided, or endured with intense fear or anxiety that is out proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object/situation and to the sociocultural context. These symptoms are persistent and last for at least six months. The prevalence of specific and social phobia in children and adolescents is 2.9 and 0.3%. Panic disorder is defined as recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and is accompanied by at least 4/13 symptoms. One of these panic attacks must be followed by at least one month of constant worry about additional panic attacks and their consequences. There is a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. Such disturbances are not attributable to physiological effects of other substances, medical conditions, or other mental disorders. The prevalence of panic disorders is 5 – 15 percent in adolescents and 5 percent in children.\r\n\r\nCase Presentation: We present a case of a 3-year old male with panic attacks for over one year which started after an incident of smoke detector alarm followed by three more episodes of panic attacks at the daycare center. The recent episode was 4 weeks ago. After the last incident, the patient stopped eating and refused food which worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobia, eating disorder, and referred to outpatient Psychologist.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n• Learn about anxiety disorders in children.\r\n\r\n• Management options for anxiety in children.\r\n\r\n• Etiopathogenesis of anxiety in children.\r\n\r\nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of panic disorder below the age of 4. We conducted a literature review and found no cases published. This is an interesting case for psychiatrists, therapists and pediatricians to learn as there is a lack of evidence in treating children under the age of 4. No medication recommendations were available for this age group; however, off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication was discussed with the patient’s mother who refused. We agreed with the primary care team’s recommendations and the case was referred to an out-patient psychotherapist.",

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "It is 16 years since we reviewed anhedonia in depression. Since then, there have been important developments in the study of anhedonia, mainly using the new techniques that neuroimaging made available, which provide very interesting new insights. It is becoming increasingly apparent that anhedonia, with psychomotor retardation, defines a dimension in depressive disorder that seems to be distinct from a dimension encompassing mood plus somatic symptoms. These dimensions can coexist, but may also be present separately. The first appears associated with disturbances (under-functioning) in dopamine function; the other appears to be related to a similar under-functioning in the serotonin system. Furthermore, anhedonia itself increasingly appears to be a composite symptom, consisting of at least two dimensions (i.e. a motivational/appetitive and a consummatory one). Depression appears to be characteristically linked more to the first one, in contrast to what was originally thought. We discuss the significance of the above in the evolving treatment of depression and the potential use of dopamine-targeting drugs.",

Recent studies are showing schizophrenia affects those who have compromised cognitive function or low IQ. Moreover different brain imaging techniques have shown structural and functional abnormality in certain areas.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "title": "Updated Review on the Diagnosis and Primary Management of Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are paroxystic and episodic events associated with motor, sensory, mental or autonomic manifestations, which resemble epileptic seizures (ES), but are not caused by epileptogenic activity. PNES affect between 20% and 30% of patients attending at epilepsy centers and constitute a serious mental health problem. PNES are often underdiagnosed, undertreated and mistaken with epilepsy. PNES are diagnosed after medical causes (epilepsy, syncope, stroke, etc.) have been ruled out, and psychological mechanisms are involved in their genesis and perpetuation. For psychiatry, there is not a single definition for PNES; the DSM-IV and ICD-10/11 describe the conversion and dissociative disorders, and the DSM-5 describes the functional neurological disorders. However, patients with PNES also have a high frequency of other comorbidities like depression, particularly trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder. It has been postulated that PNES are essentially dissociations that operate as a defensive psychological mechanism that use the mind as a defense to deal with traumas. With the advent of VEEG in the 90s, the recognition of PNES has significantly increased, and several psychological treatments have been developed. In this manuscript, we carried out a state-of-the-art review, with the aim to provide a critical approach to the extensive literature about PNES, focusing on diagnostic aspects, the primary management, and the available treatments that have been shown to be effective for the improvement of PNES. Keywords: psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, conversion disorder, dissociative disorder, diagnosis, treatment",

We aimed to verify the presence of peripheral nerve involvement in a large cohort of DM1 patients and to determine clinical consequences. A total of 93 patients underwent detailed neurological examination and nerve conduction studies. Additionally, balance impairment was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale and health status was evaluated with the SF-36 health survey. Sensory symptoms were not reported and mild sensory signs were found in six patients. Electrophysiological abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of neuropathy were found in 16 patients (17%). Peripheral nerve involvement was significantly associated with decreased muscle strength (p = 0.001) and absence of Achilles-tendon reflexes (p = 0.003), but not with age or duration of neuromuscular symptoms. It had no significant effect on balance, mental or physical health. In conclusion, peripheral nerve involvement may be one of the multisystemic manifestations of DM1, but is usually subclinical. Other causes should be excluded when sensory symptoms or signs are severe.",

After this prodromal phase, a persecutory delusion and hallucinations are often present in decompensated schizophrenia. In decompensated bipolar disorder, the delusional syndrome is congruent with the mood. The care should be the earliest possible. The treatment by antipsychotic or mood stabilizer must be increased or re-introduced and maintained during a long time in order to prevent a relapse.

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages.

      "abstract": "A post-traumatic vegetative state that holds for more than 12 months is defined as “permanent”, implying a very low probability of regaining consciousness. Here we report on a patient who emerged from a traumatic vegetative state after 20 months. Beginning from the 6th month, we observed an improvement in the event-related potentials (ERPs) of his brain to complex sensory and verbal stimulation, although the clinical examinations remained unchanged. The possible role of ERPs as predictors of regaining consciousness after a vegetative state is discussed.\n\nThe vegetative state is a most severe neurological syndrome and includes the loss of all kinds of conscious behaviour despite preserved wakefulness.1 In patients with traumatic head injury, a vegetative state that holds for more than 1 year is considered to be “permanent”, which implies irreversibility. In fact, even minimal improvement after this period is extremely improbable. From time to time, however, cases of late emergence are reported,2,3 sometimes even 5 years after the incident.4 The statement “The available data are insufficient to provide a trustworthy estimate of the incidence of late improvement” (Childs and Merger,3 p 24) is still valid; figures varying as broadly as from 1.6% to 14% have been reported.1,3\n\nGiven the rarity of such cases, the slightest hint that such an unexpected improvement may occur would be useful. Here we describe a patient in whom cognitive components of cortical ERPs were consistently obtained for more than 1 year before clinical recovery.\n\nA 28-year-old man was admitted to an intensive care unit with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 after a severe car accident.

These disorders reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system and are an important predictor of the social functioning recovery of patients. The question of the deficit structure remains open. In some cases, cognitive impairments are detected in early school age, in others, they appear only in adolescence. At the disease onset, there is a sharp deterioration in cognitive functioning. Further change is also heterogeneous: the same cognitive functions can either remain stable, or deteriorate or improve. To further study the cognitive deficit, it is necessary to distinguish more homogeneous groups based on both clinical parameters, and on the results of performing cognitive tests. It is important for the future of the concept of cognitive deficit to correlate it with the usual conceptualizations, including pathopsychological symptom groups.",

      "abstract": "To study the long-term clinical course and outcomes of atypical psychosis, 8 patients diagnosed with atypical psychosis were observed for more than 12 years (mean, 20 years). Retrospective examination was performed, particularly with respect to clinical features at each episode. The overall course of each case was classified as one of the following three types: Type I--\"Recurrent confused state\" type. Patients frequently repeated acute transient confused or dream-like states in a similar way, sometimes and/or for part of the episode accompanied by a floating paranoid-hallucinatory state. Duration of psychotic episode was short, persisting for a few days to about one month. Type II--\"Manic-depressive illness similar\" type. After a long course of disease, the predominantly early middle-aged patients (30- to 40 years-old) demonstrated fewer original characteristic features of acute confused or dream-like states. Instead, manic or depressive episodes tended to predominate. Duration of psychotic episodes exceeded the duration of type I episodes, to a maximum of about 3 months. Type III--\"Appearance of residual state\" type. After several episodes characterized by transient confused state during middle age, residual states consisting of a slight depressive state, reduced spontaneity and flattening of emotions appear. These states become durable and the periodicity of the disease disappeared. We conclude that the core group of atypical psychosis patients presents with confused symptoms as a clinical feature of episodes, and with the recurrent confused state type representing the long-term clinical course. \"Shift to manic-depressive illness similar\" and \"appearance of residual state\" types were considered to be derived from the core group, according to the interplay of personality structure and viable dynamics.",

      "title": "Introduction to psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

Focal slow-wave abnormalities imply a local disturbance of cortical and sometimes adjacent subcortical structures. Generalized intermittent slowing occurs most commonly in diverse encephalopathies.

These symptoms may or may not be explained by a medical condition. The two major changes to the DSM-IV criteria included eliminating the requirement that somatic symptoms be organically unexplained and adding the requirement that certain psychobehavioral features have to be present to justify the diagnosis. The new criteria also eliminated somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder from the previous definitions.

Although affected patients may appear to have a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, no structural disease process is evident, nor are symptoms deliberately feigned. Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made: onset of symptoms has to occur before the age of seven, symptoms should have been present longer than 6 months and they must be causing significant impairment. The prevalence of ADHD is at least 5%. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence. At the age of 25, half will still have symptoms which continue to cause significant impairment. ADHD is associated with an increased rate of other disorders: mood disorders; anxiety; other behavioural disorders; autism spectrum disorders; tic disorders; specific learning difficulties; developmental co-ordination disorder and sleep disorders. The GP has an important role in identification of possible ADHD, and onward referral, and also in the management of ADHD post-diagnosis, particularly with respect to prescribing medication usually on a shared care basis with specialist services.",

      "abstract": "This manuscript presents working definitions for key clinical course indicators for bipolar disorder, including response, remission, relapse, recurrence, and roughening.A work group of experts in bipolar disorder reviewed prior efforts to define clinical course indicators for unipolar depression and for schizophrenia. Using these efforts as templates, the work group developed consensus operational definitions. The rationale for each of the definitions was a point of time when a treatment decision needed to be made.The group defined response as a 50% reduction in a score from a standard rating scale of symptomatology from an appropriate baseline, regardless of index episode type (manic, depressed, or mixed). In addition, the other pole cannot be significantly worsened during response. Remission was defined as absence or minimal symptoms of both mania and depression for at least 1 week. Sustained remission requires at least eight consecutive weeks of remission, and perhaps as many as 12 weeks. A relapse/recurrence was defined as a return to the full syndrome criteria of an episode of mania, mixed episode, or depression following a remission of any duration. Roughening was defined as a return of symptoms at a subsyndromal level, perhaps representing a prodrome of an impending episode.The work group recommends that all reports of clinical trials in bipolar disorder include results using these definitions. This will introduce standards for such reports. Hopefully, the definitions will be revised and improved over time.",

Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

However, this differentiation between a sole diagnosis of OCD and prodromal schizophrenia seems challenging in some settings. We present a sixteen-year-old male with six-months history of recurrent intrusive images and fearfulness, in addition to decreased socialization. He was managed as a case of prodromal schizophrenia and was treated with antipsychotics. His obsessions decreased but he continued to exhibit negative schizophrenia within two years of follow-up. Acknowledging the diversity of prodromal schizophrenia presentations rather than treating symptoms as a cross-sectional diagnosis (especially in high-risk population for psychosis) is crucial for a better management.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: This case illustrates the complexity of the diagnosis of an officially established disorder that is OCD with well-defined criteria and controversial labeling prodromal schizophrenia with several presentations including OCD. The impact of OCD/OCS among prodromal schizophrenia or at-risk people for psychosis was revealed in some studies by having a higher clinical impairment, more depressive symptoms and suicidality.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Our patient was managed as a case of prodromal schizophrenia rather than solely OCD based on the associated features (aloofness, progressive social and academic decline, slowed psychomotor functions and dysprosody). Positive family history of schizophrenia in addition to praecox feeling further confirmed the patient’s condition. The following two years of the patient’s course revealed the necessity of considering the full detailed presentation of prodromal schizophrenia rather than the spot diagnosis of OCD to benefit from early intervention psychosis services and minimize the clinical deterioration.",

Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "abstract": "Because tardive dyskinesia and spontaneous dyskinesia appear the same, it is difficult to determine whether an individual patient's abnormal movements are induced by medication or have developed spontaneously. Therefore, estimates of the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia that are based on observations not adjusted for spontaneous dyskinesia are inflated. In addition, age is thought to be an important risk factor in the development of both tardive and spontaneous dyskinesias. The authors estimate the prevalence of both disorders for specific age groups.The authors reviewed nine reports on dyskinesia prevalence that included history of neuroleptic treatment and related prevalence to age. A rating of 2 or more on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale or an equivalent score on another scale was considered an indication of dyskinesia. If the subject had taken neuroleptics for more than 3 months, the movement disorder was classified as neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia; other dyskinesias were considered spontaneous. The prevalence of tardive dyskinesia was defined as the rate of neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia minus the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia.The true rate of tardive dyskinesia was below 20% for all age groups except 70-79 years. The correlation between the rate of neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia and the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia was low.After age 40 the prevalence of spontaneous dyskinesia is sufficiently high to conclude that many patients with diagnoses of tardive dyskinesia have abnormal movements attributable to causes other than neuroleptics.",

      "title": "Premenstruális szindróma és premenstruális dysphoriás zavar.",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak a mindennapi életben, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS és a premenstruációs dysphoriás zavar (PMDD) diagnózisa a következő kritériumok alapján állítható fel a Premenstruális Rendellenességek Nemzetközi Társaságának (International Society for Premenstrual Disorders – ISPMD) ajánlása szerint: a PMS esetében a nőnek 1–4 tünete van, amelyek lehetnek fizikai, viselkedési vagy affektív/pszichológiai jellegűek, vagy minimum 5 tünettel rendelkezik, melyek fizikai vagy viselkedési jellegűek. Ha viszont egy nőnek 5 vagy több tünete van, és ezek közül az egyik affektív tünet (például ingerlékenység, hangulatingadozás, düh) a fizikai vagy viselkedési tünetek mellett, akkor a pontosabb PMDD diagnózisa állítható fel. A diagnózisok megerősítéséhez az általános és a nőgyógyászati anamnézis mellett a páciens által naponta kitöltött prospektív skálák, például a menstruációs tünetek hatásának és súlyosságának prospektív nyilvántartása, továbbá a problémák súlyosságának napi nyilvántartási skálája jelent segítséget. A terápiás terv kialakításakor fontos figyelembe venni a tünetek súlyosságát, a nő fogamzási terveit vagy fogamzásgátlási igényeit, a társuló egyéb betegségeit és a korábbi kezelési módszerekre adott válaszát. A terápiás lehetőségek közé tartozik – a PMS és a PMDD súlyosságától függően – a rendszeres aerob testmozgás, a stresszoldás, a kognitív viselkedésterápia, a gyógyszeres kezelések (szelektív szerotoninvisszavétel-gátlók, kombinált oralis ösztrogén-progesztin fogamzásgátlók, GnRH-agonisták).

      "title": "Syndrome of Transient Headache and Neurological Deficits with Cerebrospinal Fluid Lymphocytosis (HaNDL): A Case Report - Is there an Association with the COVID-19 Vaccine?",
      "abstract": "Bartleson, 1981 described the syndrome of transient headache and neurologic deficits with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis (HaNDL) for the first time.[1] HaNDL is classified as a \"headache attributed to nonvascular intracranial disorder\" and is included in the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders.[2] HaNDL, a rare clinical entity, is diagnosed according to the following criteria: (1) episodes of migraine-like headache; (2) accompanied or shortly preceded by the onset of at least one transient neurological deficit lasting >4 h, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (>15 white cells/mL), with negative etiological studies; (3) development or significant worsening of headache and transient neurological deficits in temporal relation to the onset or worsening of the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis or led to its discovery, and/or have significantly improved in parallel with the improvement in the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis; and (4) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. The syndrome resolves within 3 months.[2] Although the etiology of HaNDL is not precisely known, based on CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, it is assumed to be associated with an autoimmune or infectious inflammatory disease. Cortical spreading depression may also cause neurologic deficits.[3] CSF lymphocytosis may be accompanied by elevated CSF total protein and CSF pressure that supports possible inflammation. Electroencephalography (EEG) may demonstrate focally abnormal areas consistent with focal neurological deficits. The neurological manifestations include sensory symptoms in approximately three-quarters, aphasia in two-thirds, and motor deficits in a little more than half of the cases.[2] Neurologic adverse events such as fever, headache, fatigue, and myalgia following coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination are generally mild and transient. One of the most frequent neurological complaints reported after the COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Twenty-eight-year-old female patient with migraine reported to our outpatient clinic with severe headache, speech disturbances, and right-sided sensory symptoms. She had a throbbing pain localized to the left hemisphere, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. The migraine attacks occurred once every 2 months and were responsive to simple analgesics. After the second dose of COVID-19 (BNT162b2-BioNTech) vaccination, the frequency and character of headache attacks changed. Distinct severe headaches were noted, and the frequency of headache attacks was increased to 15 days a month with a significantly reduced analgesic response. After 2 months of vaccination, severe headache attacks became chronic and right-sided hemi-hypesthesia and dysarthria appeared. There was no recent viral disease history except for the COVID-19 infection 8 months back during which she had mild symptoms. There was a minimal increase in the frequency of headaches without any change in character. However, dramatic changes occurred post-vaccination. Neurologic examination revealed mild dysarthria, and right hemi-hypesthesia with normoactive tendon reflexes, without any motor disturbance, neck stiffness, meningeal irritation signs, pathological reflexes, or cognitive dysfunction. A detailed blood work-up was performed, including vitamin B12 levels, and serological tests, all of which were within normal limits. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was weakly positive (1/100) in the vasculitis panel. Detailed autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibody panels were all negative. Ophthalmological examination revealed no papilledema. Contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), non-contrast computerized tomography (CT), MR angiography (MRA), venography, and EEG were unremarkable. Lumbar puncture (LP) showed leukocytic pleocytosis with lymphocytic dominance (45 leukocytes-80% lymphocytes without erythrocytes). CSF opening pressure was 10 cm/CSF and analysis revealed normal protein (40 mg/dL) and normal glucose levels (61 mg/dL-serum: 79 mg/dL). The CSF viral panel, Gram stain, and culture were negative. After the exclusion of other differential diagnoses, HaNDL secondary to the COVID-19 vaccination was diagnosed and was followed closely with symptomatic treatment. The patient's clinical symptoms lasted for approximately 3 weeks and then disappeared spontaneously. During the 6-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of neurologic deficits despite the occasional headache. There are different views on the etiology of HaNDL syndrome. The presence of inflammatory CSF findings suggests that infection and/or inflammation triggers the condition. Additionally, it is hypothesized that viral infection may activate the immune system and cause HaNDL syndrome.[4] The most important finding in support of this hypothesis is that some patients had a viral infection before the onset of symptoms.[5] After infection with COVID-19, persistent or new symptoms may develop for weeks or months, called long COVID or post-COVID syndrome. The symptoms may exceed 12 weeks. Common symptoms in people with long COVID are fatigue, headache, breathlessness, cough, chest pain, myalgia and weakness, insomnia, memory and concentration problems, and worsened quality of life.[6] Although the frequency of the patient's headache increased post-COVID-19 infection, it was vaccine-related rather than infection since the main change in headache character was post-vaccination. A known adverse event of COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Patients with migraine-type headaches develop more headaches after COVID-19 vaccination compared to healthy controls.[7] In BNT162b2 clinical trials (manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer), a higher incidence of headache was noted after the second dose than the first dose, with approximately 52% of patients reporting mild to moderate headaches.[8] In accordance with the literature data, headaches increased in our patients with a history of migraine, particularly after the second vaccination dose. Studies emphasize that the risk of headache after vaccination is increased twice and has a migrainous character in one-third of patients. Although the mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced headaches are still unclear, it may be owing to a systemic inflammatory response.[9] Vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA may cause an immunomodulatory response. The immune system stimulation following vaccination induces a strong T-cell response and increases CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells.[10] Although the neurological deficit developed in our patient 2 months after the vaccination, there was a significant and constant change in the frequency and character of the headaches immediately post-vaccination. Therefore, the neurological deficit added 2 months later was considered a continuation. In light of all these data and after excluding other differential diagnoses, the COVID-19 vaccination may be considered as a possible cause of HaNDL syndrome by triggering inflammation in our patient. HaNDL should be considered in the differential diagnosis after excluding other probable causes in patients with neurological deficits and headaches post-COVID-19 vaccination.

      "abstract": "Simple febrile seizures are generalised in onset and have a brief duration. The American Academy of Pediatrics defines this brief duration to be <15 minutes; whereas, in the UK, a maximum duration of 10 minutes is used. Simple febrile seizures do not occur more than once in 24 hours and resolve spontaneously. Complex febrile seizures are longer lasting, have focal symptoms (at onset or during the seizure), and can recur within 24 hours or within the same febrile illness. This review only deals with simple febrile seizures. About 2% to 5% of children in the US and Western Europe, and 6% to 9% of infants and children in Japan, will have experienced at least one febrile seizure by the age of 5 years. A very small number of children with simple febrile seizures may develop afebrile seizures, but simple febrile seizures are not associated with any permanent neurological deficits.We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments given during episodes of fever in children (aged 6 months to 5 years) with one or more previous simple febrile seizures? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).We found 4 RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: intermittent anticonvulsants (clobazam, diazepam, lorazepam), antipyretic drug treatments (paracetamol, ibuprofen), and conservative measures (watchful waiting, physical antipyretic measures [tepid sponging, removing clothes, cooling room, direct fanning of child]).",

      "title": "Delusions in Major Depressive Disorder: Recommendations for the DSM-V",
      "abstract": "false negatives and false positives may occur. The presence of the delusions may be actively concealed by the patient (for instance, by a mother who is afraid that she will lose her children if she reveals her delusions), or the patient may be unable to fully recognize or report the presence of delusions because of perplexity, psychic retardation or agitation. On the other hand, the expressions sometimes used by patients when talking about their depressive feelings may be misleading, and some severely depressed patients may endorse the strongest terms used in structured interviews even if these terms do not apply to their particular case: this may generate false positives. Delusions are not included in the DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode, but their presence can be recorded using the specifier ‘severe with psychotic features’, with the possibility to further specify whether the delusions are ‘mood congruent’ or ‘mood incongruent’ [7] . Thus, the DSM-IV seems to make two assumptions: (a) that every delusional depression will also be severe (i.e. characterized by the presence of several symptoms in excess to those required to make the diagnosis, and by a marked interference with social functioning), and (b) that, in an individual depressive episode, delusions will either be all congruent or all incongruent with depressed mood. In fact, it is not possible to record the concomitant presence of both mood-congruent and mood-incongruent delusions. However, some preliminary research evidence seems to question these two assumptions. One study reported that delusions can also be present in deDelusions are a common symptom in major depressive disorder, occurring in about 25% of hospitalized patients and almost 15% of cases in the community [1, 2] . The phenomenology and prognostic significance of delusions in depressed patients are currently being discussed again within the context of the work on the DSM-V [3–6] . According to the DSM-IV [7] , depressive thoughts, in order to be classified as delusions, must fulfill two criteria: (a) the judgment has to be so extreme as to defy credibility (i.e. the belief has to be of ‘delusional proportions’), and (b) the patient must be unable to acknowledge the possibility that the belief may not be true (i.e. the belief has to be maintained with ‘delusional intensity’). However, in clinical practice, there may be problems in applying these criteria. For instance, the delusional intensity of a belief may fluctuate during a depressive episode: some clinicians and researchers will classify the belief as a delusion even if the delusional intensity is present only for most of the time during the depressive episode, whereas others will require that the delusional intensity be consistently present throughout the depressive episode. Moreover, it happens that a belief fulfills one of the two criteria above but not the other: it is of delusional proportions but not maintained with delusional intensity, or vice versa. In these cases, clinicians and researchers may reach different conclusions about whether or not the patient has a delusion. It is also useful to emphasize that, in the assessment of the presence of delusions in a depressed patient, both Received: June 22, 2007 Accepted after revision: July 30, 2007 Published online: October 18, 2007",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

Symptoms of grief or bereavement may be characterized by agitation, somatic complaint and social withdrawal. Other situational factors may precipitate maladjustment with depressed mood. Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease.

Contrary evidence, however, suggests that dysphoric mania may be a form of typical mania, a stage-related or severe form of mania, or a transitional state between mania and depression. Because the evidence may be inconsistent because of varying definitions of dysphoric mania among studies, the authors propose preliminary operational diagnostic criteria for the future study of dysphoric mania.",

      "title": "A boy with dissociative symptoms who benefited from biopsychosocial assessment",
      "abstract": "Dissociative disorder is defined in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as “a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity and immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements,” and its prevalence in children is as low as 1.30 per 100,000 population.1 We report a case of dissociative disorder secondary to a combination of psychosocial factors in addition to the developmental characteristics of the patient, both of which have been overlooked. A 9-year-old boy suddenly lost consciousness during class one day and received a diagnosis of suspected epilepsy at another hospital. One month later, during another class, he lost consciousness again after experiencing a tremor in his hands. A close examination revealed no abnormality, and the patient was thought to have suspected psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Various short-lived involuntary movements with impaired consciousness were often observed and gradually increased in frequency, and odd behavior was observed: When the subject of school or home came up, the child would suddenly become “spaced out,” scratch his face with his hands “like an animal,” and mimic “meow” for several tens of seconds, unable to communicate with staff. The neurologist re-examined the patient for neurological diseases including encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy as differential diagnoses. However, various laboratory tests and imaging studies were negative for organic diseases. The fact that positive symptoms appeared only during stress was also suggestive of nonorganic disease. Outpatient treatment was initiated in our department but the patient was admitted to the liaison department for biopsychosocial assessment because of frequent school absences and his mother's increasing fatigue due to difficulties in raising her child at home. During his hospitalization, we conducted a psychosocial assessment by interviewing his mother about his upbringing and developmental history, observing his behavior, and conducting psychological tests. The interviews revealed his rigid thought patterns and sensory sensitivity from early childhood, and the observations of his behavior revealed a lack of nonverbal communication, so we diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. The case formulation based on the assessment results is shown in Table 1. In terms of biology, predisposing factors included cognitive bias—the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children®-Fourth Edition (WISC®-IV) at age 7 years: total IQ, 90; verbal comprehension, 119; perceptual reasoning, 76; working memory, 79; processing speed, 86—and developmental characteristics, such as obsessiveness, sensory sensitivity, and poor communication skills. As psychological factors, the initial seizures and loss of consciousness were considered to have been induced by stress with classmates, such as feelings of inferiority. Because both seizures occurred during group work, when he was being helped by group members with a task he was having difficulty with. As a social factor, there was domestic discord between parents and between siblings. The school was also unaware of the cognitive characteristics and did not take them into consideration in his daily life and learning. The stressors that he experienced therefore included changes in learning difficulty and interpersonal relationships due to his promotion to the next grade. As a therapeutic intervention, risperidone was administered as a biological treatment for the irritability in autism spectrum disorder, and psychotherapy was conducted to explain the disease to the parents and the patient, and to encourage the patient to verbalize the disease. As social treatment, we provided parents with disease education and parent training according to their son's developmental characteristics. We also shared information with the school regarding the school's understanding of the child and reasonable accommodation, including symptoms caused by the child's developmental characteristics, necessary environmental adjustments, and involvement in school situations that would encourage verbalization. After explaining the findings to the patient and his family, the dissociative symptoms gradually resolved during the 2-week hospitalization, and the patient was discharged. Fortunately, his relationship with his family has improved, and he has been transferred to a special-needs class. In this case, “personality switching,” “detachment,” “loss of sense of reality,” and “dissociative convulsions” were present as dissociative symptoms. There have been few case reports of children with dissociative disorders secondary to autism spectrum disorders.2 It is possible that the prevalence of dissociative disorders is low and that many cases, such as the present case, go undiagnosed without adequate evaluation of developmental characteristics as background. The psychosocial factors of pediatric patients with PNES are numerous and complex3 and now that biopsychosocial assessment is mandatory. “Consultation liaison psychiatry” that links psychiatry and physical medicine and provides comprehensive medical care to patients is necessary.4 Although the clinical course and symptoms of this case were atypical and difficult to diagnose, a case formulation5 from a biopsychosocial perspective in collaboration with the liaison department and the neurology department clarified each of the complex overlapping factors, leading to the planning and implementation of an effective comprehensive treatment. Further development of pediatric consultation liaison psychiatry to enhance biopsychosocial assessment would be of great benefit. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The disturbances induced constitute a psychoneurotoxic syndrome--\"a state of drunkenness\"--of about four hours duration which develops in three distinct phases. The basic mental symptoms of this syndrome consist of disturbances of the apperception, sensory perception and emotion. A moderate impairment of egofunctioning or reality appraisal and an inability to integrate different mental processes are observed. The psychomotor behavior is mainly harmonized to the prevailing emotional state and to the experiences caused by perceptual alterations, in a lesser degree. These changes, according to our observations, are more severe and more \"psychotic-like\" in schizophrenics rather than in normals. Psychopathological analysis of these changes proves that the whole syndrome cannot be considered as related to the spontaneously triggered functional psychoses or to the organic ones and, therefore, the term \"model-psychosis\" according to our opinion, is unsatisfactory.",

      "title": "Insight in bipolar disorder",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Insight in bipolar disorder While the relationship between lack of insight in psychiatric disorders and anosognosia in neurological disorders has not been extensively studied, interest in examining psychiatric lack of insight has roots in advances in the understanding of the anosognosia. It is possible that both conditions share a common etiology in parietal and/or frontal lobe dysfunction, or they may represent two distinct entities with different etiologies, i.e., with predominance of brain dysfunction in anosognosia as opposed to the possible prominence of psychosocial factors in psychiatric lack of insight. While it has long been recognized that insight is impaired in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, the topic of insight in bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected. In mania, impairment of insight is about as severe as in schizophrenia and probably is associated with poor prognosis. The neuropsychological and/or psychosocial roots of lack of insight in mania remain unclear even if we recently reported that lack of insight might predict impaired decision-making in manic patients. In bipolar depression, impairment of insight is less severe than in mania; however, psychotic depression is associated with less insight than non-psychotic depression. There is some evidence that insight in depression may be less impaired when depressive symptoms are more severe, possibly supporting the depressive realism hypothesis. In remission, bipolar patients seem to recover insight. Thus, lack of insight in bipolar disorder appears to be a state-related phenomenon, unlike schizophrenia. Interest in studying clinical, neuropsychological and biological roots of insight in bipolar disorder, and their changes across different phases of illness, may improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying awareness of well-being in human.

Such conditions are labeled on the basis of excluding known disease and as a group they have been designated as functional somatic syndromes or medically unexplained syndromes (3,4). One such medically unexplained syndrome is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (5,6), a relatively common condition of unclear origin that is estimated to affect as many as 400 per 100,000 adults with increased prevalence among minorities, women, and persons in lower-income brackets (7). CFS is associated with disability and poor health-related quality of life and is characterized by disabling fatigue of at least 6 mo in duration (5–8).",

In settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, the rate of malingering may be as high as 30%, but its frequency in clinical practice is not known. We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

      "title": "Non‐ulcer dyspepsia: myths and realities",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

      "abstract": "Poor performance on cognitive testing is common in SLE but it is not progressive in the majority of patients and may fluctuate or resolve without specific treatment. Cognitive impairment in patients without overt CNS-SLE may result from generalised disease activity or psychiatric disorder which reduce speed, concentration and motivation. This emphasises once again the importance of recognising and treating psychiatric disorder in these patients. Although mean cognitive scores are lower in SLE patients with overt CNS involvement than those without, an individual's cognitive score is a poor predictor of the presence of CNS involvement because of considerable overlap between groups. It has been suggested that the pattern of cognitive impairment, rather than simply whether it is present or absent, may be more helpful in identifying patients with CNS involvement but this requires further investigation in prospective studies. Cognitive impairment at one point in time is not predictive of future CNS events during 1 or 2 years of follow-up. Routine cognitive testing in SLE does not therefore appear to be helpful either for identifying patients with current CNS involvement or for identifying those at future risk of this complication. In the absence of double-blind randomised controlled trials, treatment of neuropsychiatric SLE is based on clinical experience and anecdotal case reports. Aggressive immunosuppression with high-dose corticosteroids in conjunction with either azathioprine or cyclophosphamide may be indicated in patients with life-threatening CNS-SLE but, on the basis of current evidence, is not justified in those with lone subtle cognitive abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

      "abstract": "The psychopathological basis of delusions in schizophrenia is poorly understood. The most enduring of several early theories has suggested a causal link with formal thought disorder, whereas recent approaches have proposed relationships with a variety of cognitive abnormalities. The correlations of delusions with other schizophrenic symptoms and with cognitive functions including semantic memory, executive function, and also probabilistic reasoning bias, were examined in a series of (overlapping) groups of 43-79 schizophrenic patients. Delusions were found to be significantly correlated with formal thought disorder, with evidence for a particular link between bizarreness and fragmentariness of delusions and \"loosening of association\". Delusions were not significantly correlated with overall intellectual function or memory, although there was some suggestion of a complex interaction between delusions, formal thought disorder, and semantic memory impairment. No association between delusions, formal thought disorder, and any measure of executive function was found. Although, as a group, schizophrenic patients showed evidence of probabilistic reasoning bias, this was unrelated to presence and severity of delusions.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "NEUROPSYCHIATRIC ASPECTS OF HIV INFECTION",
      "abstract": "A consultation on the neuropsychiatric aspects of HIV-1 infection was held at the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters January 11-13, 1990. Of topics discussed, participants concluded that a group of conditions characterized by cognitive and motor impairment can be described. New terminology was suggested accordingly. Participants found that otherwise health HIV-1 seropositive patients were no more likely than HIV-1 seronegative patients to manifest clinically significant cognitive impairment. The serological screening of asymptomatic patients for HIV-1 in attempts to protect public safety was therefore deemed unnecessary. Hallucinations and delusions being not infrequent in AIDS and ARC patients, they may be indicative of cognitive impairment or later accompanied by symptoms pointing to diagnosis of delirium or dementia. Acute psychotic disorders outside of evidence of cognitive impairment may result as anomalies described within the text. Depressive syndrome may result outside of severe depressive episode or major depression due to recent diagnosis as HIV-1 positive and/or as the first stage of HIV-1 dementia. DIstinguishing between ARC and the above-mentioned states as the cause of this syndrome may be difficult. Consultation participants cited stress associated with HIV-1 infection or disease to be conditioned by several factors. Finally, neuropsychiatric disorders due to HIV-1 opportunistic processes were discussed. Country-level recommendations included preparing health workers for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions in the HIV-1 positive patient, and notifying then that otherwise healthy HIV-1 positive patients may not show clinically significant signs of cognitive impairment. Recommendations followed in urging health services to prepare for a large burden of neuropsychiatric illness in AIDS and ARC patients; governments should support services and train health workers accordingly. Pre- and post-serological testing counseling was stressed, with facility for and understanding of the special needs of HIV-1 positive patients' families and involved health staff. Research on the neurological and mental health needs of patients should be given high priority with attention given to the immediate policy and care implications. Final qualification of the difficulty involved in generalizing research findings to apply across sociocultural and geographical contexts was provided with mention in the text of a WHO multicenter study addressing this concern in its pilot phase at the time of publication. Neurological tests were designed for use in this study to be culturally nonspecific.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is a condition in which multiple epileptic seizures occur without complete recovery from the physiological effects of one seizure before another seizure occurs. There are as many types of SE as there are kinds of epileptic seizures. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus initially presents with repeated generalized convulsions without full recovery of consciousness between seizures. If untreated or undertreated, the convulsive activity becomes progressively subtle and is accompanied by a predictable series of progressive EEG changes. Non-convulsive SE refers to complex partial SE or absence SE, both of which exhibit an epileptic twilight state of altered contact with the environment. In simple partial SE there is no impairment of consciousness, and the behavioural changes reflect focal ictal discharges confined to one area of the cortex. There are between 65,000 and 150,000 cases of the SE in the US each year. Both acute and remote cerebral insults can cause SE, as can severe systemic disease that causes SE secondary to a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Mortality is high, but is largely a reflection of underlying aetiology when SE is treated appropriately and aggressively. Treatment is focused on terminating ongoing seizure activity as quickly as possible, both because the longer SE persists the more likely permanent neuronal damage will ensure and also because of strong evidence that the longer SE persists the more refractory to treatment it will be. Currently the most commonly accepted treatment protocol involves rapid initiation of therapy with intravenous lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg), followed, if necessary, by 20 mg/kg of phenytoin, followed, if necessary, by 20 mg/kg of phenobarbital. However, some neurologists still use intravenous diazepam (because of its more rapid antistatus effect) followed by phenytoin. New experimental data in the rat suggest that phenytoin followed by diazepam may be more effective, but this order of administration still has to tested in properly designed clinical trials.",

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness).

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

Non-convulsive seizures represent states of various levels of altered awareness, associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity, but without outwardly observable convulsive activity2. An important feature of convulsive seizures is their potential for evolution into non-convulsive seizures, where the patient can appear “post ictal” but is having electrical seizures, without obvious convulsive activity3. Other types of status epilepticus include simple partial status (with preserved awareness), complex partial status (with impaired consciousness) and myoclonic status (often associated with coma)4.\r\n\r\nRecords from antiquity describe SE, but it has only been in the last century that there have been major advances in its understanding and treatment5.

Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as severity, a high rate of recurrence, psychomotor changes, dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression. The treatment of psychotic mood disorders, regardless of coexisting conditions, requires pharmacotherapy--usually a combination of an antipsychotic drug and a medication for mood--or electroconvulsive therapy. The results of treatment are usually positive.",

      "abstract": "A seizure is the manifestation of symptoms or signs produced by excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. It usually presents as brief, self-limited episodes of involuntary movements that can affect a part or the entire body and that are sometimes accompanied by loss of consciousness and sphincter control. Epilepsy may be considered after a single unprovoked seizure in a patient with a high risk of recurrence. Paroxysmal non-epileptic disorders are defined as episodes of sudden onset and short duration that imitate an epileptic seizure, caused by a brain dysfunction of diverse origin that, unlike epilepsy, is not due to excessive neuronal discharge. Its incidence is much higher than epilepsy and it can appear at any age. It is important for diagnosis to analyze the triggering factors, the details of each episode, physical examination and only proceed to basic complementary tests such as video-electroencephalogram in case of doubt or for diagnostic confirmation. There is a tendency to overdiagnose epilepsy and excessive use of anticonvulsant drugs. Those that can most frequently be confused are syncope, \"daydreams\" and pseudoseizures.",

      "title": "Volitional Monocular Lilliputian Visual Hallucinations and Synesthesia",
      "abstract": "Depression, mania, bipolar affective illness with rapid cycling, and paranoid schizophreniform psychoses are common sources of distress in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibiting demyelinating plaques over the temporal lobes [1]. Dementia may occur in MS subjects. A previously reported patient with complex visual hallucinations of religious content and dementia had a large, left frontal plaque and multiple temporal and occipital lobe plaques located over the periventricular white matter [2]. The authors suggested the existence of a disconnection syndrome caused by demyelination of the long subcortical white matter association bundles of the cerebral hemispheres [2]. A patient with MS and complex behavioral manifestations, initially confused with psychiatric illness, is reported. She had no previous history of psychiatric disorders. Despite her isolated complex hallucinations and unusual experiential phenomena, she had no clinical evidence of dementia or intercurrent psychosis.A 54-year old female with no personal or family history of neurologic or psychiatric illnesses suffered a grand mal seizure without aura 7 years prior to her neurologic consultation. She was healthy until her first seizure, and no concurrent illness was identified on initial evaluation. She had no family history of epilepsy and was taking no prescription or illicit drugs. After her first seizure, she had ataxia and retrograde amnesia for a few weeks. Her initial MRI of the brain showed white matter lesions of the cerebral hemispheres. Oligoclonal bands were recovered from her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF cell count and protein content were normal, and cultures for bacteria and viruses were negative. Her EEG showed bilateral temporal theta but no specific epileptic discharges. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy. A second grand mal seizure took place 6 months later, and treatment was initiated with carbamazepine. Her second seizure was followed in 2 days by visual hallucinations of small objects while remaining fully conscious. She also noticed that the last words of a sentence, or a full sentence said to her, would repeat within her head over and over again, sometimes for as long as 30 min (echoacousia and palinacusis). Spontaneous auditory hallucinations of music, bells ringing, clocks ticking, dogs barking, cats meowing or birds chirping followed. Within months, she noticed that objects or the faces of people she stared at persisted in her sight for minutes at a time (palinopsia). If she shifted her eyes to the wall, the faces or objects appeared on the wall (visual allesthesia). At one time her face appeared '25 years younger' when she looked at herself in the mirror (facial rejuvenation). Over time, auditory hallucinations became very vivid and continuous ('racing'), to the extent that she had a very hard time falling asleep and required hypnotics. She woke up every morning to loud music within her head. She was referred to psychiatry for treatment, despite that with her hallucinations she did not experience any other alterations of consciousness, or exhibit any bizarre behavior. She was empirically treated with various tranquilizers, including haloperidol, for several years. Grand mal seizures never recurred, even after carbamazepine was discontinued, but her hallucinations did not mitigate with any treatment. Three years after the onset of her illness, she developed the unusual ability of voluntarily bringing on audiovisual TV-like hallucinations of small objects, animals, or people that either made sounds, spoke, or sang to her. For instance, if she thought of a specific famous country singer, the singer immediately appeared over her left eye singing (synesthesia). Her visual hallucinations were always stationary and confined to the upper temporal quadrant of her left eye. If she thought of an old classmate, she would see him or her clearly, the way the person was during their school years, talking to her. What the person said was appropriate and was not threatening or anxiety provoking. In other words, the content of what was said 'made sense' within the context of her retrieved memory. She was unable to hold conversations with her hallucinatory persons and had clear recollection of her hallucinations. Her general physical examination was normal. On mental status examination she was alert and oriented to time, space and person. She was appropriate, pleasant, cooperative and well-groomed. Mood and affect were normal. She exhibited no flight of ideas, hesitant, slow or bizarre thinking. Her answers were relevant and her statements logical; she had no delusions, ideas of reference, or ideas of influence. Speech was fluent, repetition was intact, and comprehension of spoken language was preserved. She was able to read aloud and silently, write spontaneously and to dictation, and draw figures normally. Mathematical calculations, including serial subtractions and ability to abstract, were normal. Short- and long-term memory were normal, as well as her attention span. There was no confabulation. Fund of knowledge, judgment, and insight of illness were good. She could recognize objects placed in her hands and had no difficulties with fine finger motor control. She could imitate gestures, and exhibited no neglect, apraxia, aprosody or prosopagnosia. She could initiate her visual hallucinations as described above on many occasions during her repeated neurologic examinations while otherwise acting appropriately. She exhibited no mood changes, alteration of consciousness, facial transfiguration, or anxiety during her visual phenomena. No stereotyped or involuntary movements were noted at those times. On neurologic examination, corrected visual acuity, visual fields, and pupillary responses were normal. Ocular movements were full and symmetric in all directions of gaze. No nystagmus was observed. Hearing was normal. Testing of the additional cranial nerves, equilibrium, muscle tone, muscle strength and sensory examination for all modalities was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and she had no grasp, rooting, or palmomental reflexes. She had bilateral Babinski signs. There was no gait disturbance and no tremors or dystonia. A repeat MRI of the brain revealed occipital periventricular areas of demyelination, subcortical white matter hyperintensities, and one small area of demyelination over the right temporal lobe (fig. 1, 2). There was no hydrocephalus and no brain stem lesions. Short and middle latency auditory evoked potentials were normal. Her blink reflexes showed a delay of the R1 component. Facial electromyogram showed polyphasic motor units of long duration over the frontalis, mentalis and orbicularis oris muscles, indicative of chronic denervation with reinnervation. Baseline EEG was normal. Her video-EEG monitoring (no sphenoidal electrodes were employed) and brain SPECT during her typical voluntarily induced visual hallucinations failed to demonstrate epileptic discharges or blood perfusion abnormalities from the normal resting awake state. Treatment with clonazepam helped her to sleep, but did not change her hallucinations. She reported no changes in her symptoms on follow-up visits.Complex partial seizures of purely cognitive content in MS patients can be confused with intermittent behavioral manifestations of the disease due to a relapse. Therefore, it is important that epileptic events are ruled out in patients with MS who exhibit unusual recurrent symptoms, especially in the absence of motor manifestations. Although this patient had two grand mal seizures at the onset of her illness, her EEG was normal with no paroxysmal activity recorded at rest or during her spontaneous or volitional visual hallucinations. Furthermore, a brain SPECT that was completed during her volitional and spontaneous experiential phenomena was unchanged from the normal resting state while awake. Her visual symptoms must be distinguished from complex visual hallucinations and palinopsia secondary to disorders of the visual pathways. The case herein discussed had bilateral white matter hyperintensities on MRI, but no detectable abnormalities on her visual field testings.Dysmetropsia is the disorder of visual perception characterized by an apparent modification of the size of perceived objects. Objects appear either enlarged (macropsia) or shrunk (micropsia). Monocular micropsia is a symptom of retinal edema, while hemimicropsia refers to a selective disturbance in the perception of the size of an object, contralateral to a hemispheric lesion, in the absence of visual field deficits [3]. On the other hand, lilliputian or smaller than life-size colorful visual hallucinations in a clear sensorium are typical of peduncular hallucinosis in patients with lesions of the mesencephalon [4]. This patient's complex symptoms are unique because her lilliputian imagery was confined to the temporal superior quadrant of her left visual field, was faithfully reproduced voluntarily, and she had no detectable abnormalities on her visual field testing and no brain stem, thalamic, or optic nerve lesions. Although the temporal lobe demyelinating lesion may have interrupted conduction through callosal fibers (fig. 1) or through the uncinate fasciculus (fig. 2, she had none of the clinical signs of callosal disconnection and there was no evidence of transcortical aphasia. Finally, synesthesia (experiential phenomena perceived in two or more senses simultaneously) of temporal lobe epileptic origin was ruled out in this patient by her normal ictal EEG [5]. It is a common observation in clinical practice that patients with episodic painful or epileptic disorders have an inherent permissive ability to 'prime' or 'cue' their episodes, either consciously or unconsciously. In multiple sclerosis, amplification of abnormal signals arising from the areas of demyelination perhaps may be 'gated ad lib' in some exceptional cases, as the one detailed here [6]. The discovery of Bumgartner and Epstein [7]that normal individuals can voluntarily alter their visual evoked potentials without shifting their eyes supports this inherent quality of the human brain to freely modify ongoing electrophysiologic activities. The ultimate basic pathophysiology of this patient's experiential phenomena is uncertain; it may be speculated that 'cross talking' of demyelinated subcortical white matter fibers caused her symptoms, since her ictal EEG and SPECT studies were normal, revealing no epilepsy or abnormalities of brain perfusion. It is unclear what role was played by the commisural occipital fibers of the tapetum lining the walls of the posterior ventricular horns in the expression or modulation of this patient's visual hallucinations.Very recently, a patient was described with TV-like 'picture within a picture' lilliputian visual hallucinations that were embedded in her left inferior visual field, and emerged from an otherwise normal visual background. She was aware of the hallucinatory nature of her experience but had no synesthesia and no volitional control over her hallucinations. A left inferior quadrantonopsia was present and her brain MRI revealed a parieto-occipital stroke [8].",

      "title": "TRANSITORY SCHIZOPHRENIAS PRODUCED BY BROMIDE INTOXICATION",
      "abstract": "A bromide psychosis is one which starts during bromide intoxication and clears up fairly soon—usually several weeks, though sometimes longer—after discontinuance of the drug. Four varieties of bromide psychosis are known: 1. Simple intoxication, marked by dullness and mental sluggishness, with good orientation, and without delusions or hallucinations. 2. Delirium, marked by disorientation, thinking disturbances, mood disturbances (usually fear), delusions, hallucinations and other symptoms. The first two varieties are well known; the next two are not. 3. Hallucinosis, which differs from delirium in that orientation is intact. 4. Schizophrenia, a psychosis of predominantly paranoid coloring which, to the examiner who does not know the history and laboratory findings and has not yet seen the outcome, has all the earmarks of an \"ordinary\" paranoid schizophrenia, from which it differs only in that it is a transient psychosis which has supervened during bromide intoxication. Sometimes a bromide schizophrenia is accompanied by disorientation, a symptom which does not belong to the schizophrenic picture. In such cases it is believed that the bromide schizophrenia came first, and that delirium ensued subsequently because the drug was not stopped. Such cases are to be distinguished from those \"ordinary\" schizophrenics who, because of pre-existing psychotic symptoms, start taking bromide and take it long enough to become delirious. Anyone who takes enough bromide may become delirious, and there is nothing remarkable when this happens to an ordinary schizophrenic. It is quite different with the patient who was not manifestly schizophrenic until bromide made her so. Bromide schizophrenia differs from bromide delirium and hallucinosis in the following respects (leaving aside for a moment the basic difference between delirium and other psychoses in respect to orientation): 1. Bromide schizophrenia occurs by preference in persons with strong schizoid leanings, while delirium and hallucinosis show no such preference. 2. The characteristic schizophrenic disturbance of rapport is not found in delirium and hallucinosis. 3. The content of the schizophrenia, as in any ordinary schizophrenia, has a flavor of the bizarre: ideas of influence and mind-reading, ideas of electricity and somatic distortions are apt to be prominent. 4. In schizophrenia the patient's delusions and hallucinations are marked by heightened self-reference, which is not the case to the same degree in delirium and hallucinosis. It is concluded that bromide intoxication has the power to bring to the surface a latent schizophrenia, which, when favorable conditions have been restored, may once again go into hiding. In this respect bromide intoxication resembles many other intoxications. It is wise to examine the serum for bromide routinely in every acute psychosis, rather than to do so only \"when indicated.\" If the test is not made routinely, one will overlook some cases, for sometimes one does not suspect a bromide psychosis until an unexpected recovery has opened one's eyes, at which point it may be too late to verify the diagnosis chemically.",

Third, implicated brain systems must have behavioral functions that fit the psychological characteristics actually seen in schizophrenia. In each case, the evidence is weak or equivocal. However, this does not mean that neurogenic interpretations are untenable. Instead, the primacy of problems associated with the first condition, the need to parse schizophrenia and reduce heterogeneity, must be recognized.

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

Subtle personality changes tend to occur early; these include apathy, irritability and inability to pay attention. Later agitation, aggression and disinhibited behaviors may appear. We have utilized the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease to monitor a number of behavioral symptoms in 235 patients with early probable AD. Markov analyses were used to predict the probability of developing or retaining a given symptom at 6-month follow-up. The results show that the symptoms of psychopathology in AD fluctuate with time. Agitation was both the most frequent and persistent symptom, while paranoid delusions and hallucinations were less persistent. Most behavioral disturbances, except paranoid delusions, were associated with greater cognitive impairment. There was no association between depressive features and either cognitive or functional impairment. These results have important implications for the optimal treatment of the psychopathological symptoms of AD.",

No study, to our knowledge, has determined whether these other psychiatric disorders occur prior to the age of onset of anorexia nervosa. We obtained a retrospective history from 24 subjects who were long term (more than 1 year) recovered from anorexia nervosa. We found that 58% reported that they had the onset of one or more childhood anxiety disorder diagnoses at the age of 10 +/- 5 years old. This was 5 years before the mean age of onset of anorexia nervosa. The onset of depression was about 1 year before the onset of anorexia nervosa in about one half the subjects. Alcohol and substance abuse/dependency tended to occur after the onset of anorexia nervosa and only occurred in anorexic subjects who binged and/or purged. The early and common onset of childhood anxiety disorders in a substantial percentage of anorexics raises the possibility that childhood anxiety disorders herald the first behavioral expression of a biologic vulnerability in some subjects who develop anorexia nervosa.",

The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines.

The DSM-IV also excludes confounding disorders and requires confirmation of the diagnosis after 2 months of prospective daily ratings. These strict criteria reinforce the fact that not all women who have premenstrual symptoms have a mental illness. These criteria also allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is primarily reserved for milder physical and emotional symptoms.5 These criteria allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual magnification (PMM), which occurs when symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder are magnified during the premenstruum.6",

      "title": "Symptomatic therapy in multiple sclerosis: Big pharma should do more—YES",
      "abstract": "1Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a wide variety of clinical phenotypes. This can range from asymptomatic to relapsing–remitting to progressive disease phases as well as an overlapping period in between each of these phases. Each phase can further be classified as being active or not active. 1 It is well known that patients may remain in each type indefinitely or for a variable period before progressing to the next clinical phenotype. Patients may develop residual neurological deficits either from the very beginning or later at any time during the course of the disease. Although a benign course may be seen in up to one-quarter of patients, even these may have some mild motor or sensory symptoms that may cause some discomfort, fatigue that may interfere with their daily living activities or cognitive changes leading to some limitations in their professional life. Most MS patients will end up having some residual neurological symptoms. Although the residual symptoms correlate with some disability steps in MS, this may not always be the case. For example, people without significant motor findings may also have other symptoms that, once properly managed, will ease that individual’s life. However, despite the large proportion of patients affected with a wide variety of neurologic symptoms, the number of available symptomatic treatments is limited and they are only partially effective. It is clear that some of these MS-related symptoms are not MS specific and may be seen as a result of other neurological (and non-neurological) disorders resulting in a much larger patient population that requires such therapies. Regarding the available symptomatic therapies and their efficacies, it becomes clear that this is a neglected area with a high need of new therapies. The emphasis in MS has almost always been on large trials to slow or eliminate the disability worsening by eliminating relapses or shortening the time to recovery after relapses. However, many patients still have residual symptoms after a relapse and continue to develop progressive symptoms despite the available treatments. Currently, there are 12 approved disease-modifying long-term therapies in MS; some others are expected to be approved soon and many more are in clinical trials. However, none offers a cure, but rather reduce clinical relapses and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) burden to a certain extent, with a less pronounced effect on long-term disability. These therapies continue to be effective in responders as long as they are used, but in some their efficacy may wear off over time. The higherefficacy disease-modifying therapies are also associated with more serious adverse events. So, it is clear that new treatments are needed for better long-term management of a progressive disease such as MS. The good news is that there are a large number of ongoing trials in this area, most sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.",

Most importantly, it can shed light on the normal organization of the relations of consciousness to its functions and on its normal course of development. In this sense, the psychological study of schizophrenia perhaps contains the key to understanding the structure of normal consciousness. In any case, the psychological study of schizophrenia, which has not yet advanced very far, should enable us to approach normal human consciousness from the standpoint of a psychological laboratory experiment.",

Overall, there was a modest but significant deterioration in cognitive function over the decade, particularly among older men. Longitudinally, patients with persistent tardive (orofacial) dyskinesia continued to show poorer cognitive function than those consistently without such movement disorder, though within neither group did cognitive function change over the decade. Those patients demonstrating prospectively the emergence of orofacial dyskinesia showed a marked deterioration in their cognitive function over the same time-frame within which their movement disorder emerged, but this decline did not progress further thereafter. There appears to exist some modes, progressive deterioration in cognitive function even late in the chronic phase of severe schizophrenic illness which appears to derive primarily from patients showing de novo emergence of tardive orofacial dyskinesia.",

After 2 weeks of being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, he developed an acute onset illness, characterized by delusion of persecution, fearfulness, hypervigilence and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with any confusion, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations and affective symptoms. There was no past or family history of psychosis. One week after the onset of the symptoms he was prescribed tab penicillamine, initially 250 mg/day, which was increased to 500 mg/day after 3 days. After increase in the dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and led to hospitalization. A diagnosis of organic delusional disorder (F06.2) due to Wilson's disease was considered. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started, and the dose of penicillamine was reduced with which symptoms resolved.

      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that is characterized by a disintegration of the process of thinking, of emotional responsiveness, and of contact with reality. Early in the twentieth century, schizophrenia was known as dementia praecox (premature dementia), because of the disintegration or fragmenting of mental functions typically observed in people with the disorder. The term schizophrenia itself means “fragmented mind,” referring to the schisms between thought, emotion, and behavior that characterize the disease. It is not the same as “split personality,” which is an altogether different illness now known as dissociative identity disorder. People with schizophrenia do not alternate between “good” and “bad” personalities.",

      "abstract": "A task force of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) recently published a tremor classification scheme that is based on the nosologic principle of two primary axes for classifying an illness: clinical manifestations (Axis 1) and etiology (Axis 2). An Axis 1 clinical syndrome is a recurring group of clinical symptoms, signs (physical findings) and possibly laboratory results that suggest the presence of at least one underlying Axis 2 etiology. Syndromes must be defined and used consistently to be of value in finding specific etiologies and effective treatments. The MDS task force concluded that essential tremor is a common neurological syndrome that has never been defined consistently by clinicians and researchers. The MDS task force defined essential tremor as a syndrome of bilateral upper limb action tremor of at least 3 years duration, with or without tremor in other locations (e.g., head, voice, or lower limbs), in the absence of other neurological signs (e.g., dystonia, parkinsonism, myoclonus, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment). Deviations from this definition should not be labeled as essential tremor. Patients with additional questionably-abnormal signs or with signs of uncertain relevance to tremor are classified as essential tremor plus. The MDS classification scheme encourages a thorough unbiased phenotyping of patients with tremor, with no assumptions of etiology, pathology, pathophysiology or relationship to other neurological disorders. The etiologies, pathology and clinical course of essential tremor are too heterogeneous for this syndrome to be viewed as a disease or a family of diseases.",

      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

A difference in the histopathological lesion between the two groups might be responsible. Case records from 97 patients with pathologically proven Parkinson's disease were reviewed to determine the pattern of levodopa response. Pathological findings for fluctuating and non-fluctuating cases were compared. Patients with motor fluctuations had a younger age of onset and longer disease course (P < 0.001), although mean age at death was almost the same. Four milestones of advanced disease (frequent falls, visual hallucinations, cognitive disability and need for residential care) occurred at a similar time from death in each group; this interval was not proportionate to the disease duration. There were no significant differences in the severity or distribution of Lewy body or other pathologies. Irrespective of the pattern of levodopa response, patients reach a common pathological endpoint at a similar age, and the duration and manifestations of end-stage disease are alike. A non-linear or exponential time relationship may govern the late clinical and pathological progression of Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "Stressful or traumatic life events can lead to emergence of mood episodes. Events such as migration, relocation, job loss, bankruptcy, economic loss, divorce, natural disasters, accidental injury, or the loss of a loved one can trigger the first episode of bipolar disorder. After such life events, symptoms of depressive episodes often appear. Funeral mania, on the other hand, is defined as the emergence of manic episodes following the death of a close family member. Information on funeral mania, which occurs shortly after the loss of a loved one, is limited with a few case reports. In this study, a 26-year-old female patient who presented with the symptoms of a manic episode for the first time after her father's death and who had no previous psychiatric disease or treatment history was presented in the light of findings in the literature. It is noteworthy that the patient, who was followed up with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (mania period) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, had a temporal closeness between her mood symptoms and her father's death, and had not developed such a reaction to previous traumatic life events. Therefore, the diagnosis was evaluated as funeral mania. It should be kept in mind that, although rare, symptoms of mania can be seen among possible grief reactions.Strese neden olan ya da örseleyici yaşam olayları duygudurum dönemlerinin ortaya çıkmasına neden olabilir.

Bu tür yaşam olaylarından sonra genellikle depresif dönem belirtileri ortaya çıkar. Cenaze manisi ise, yakın bir aile üyesinin ölümünü takiben kişide mani dönemi belirtilerinin ortaya çıkması olarak tanımlanmıştır. Sevilen kişinin kaybından çok kısa bir süre sonra ortaya çıkan cenaze manisi ile ilgili bilgiler kısıtlıdır. Konu ile ilgili az sayıda olgu bildirimi mevcuttur.

DSM-5 tanı ölçütlerine göre bipolar bozukluk (mani dönemi) tanısı ile izlenen hastanın duygudurum dönemi belirtileri ile babasının ölümü arasındaki zamansal yakınlık olması ve önceki örseleyici yaşam olaylarına bu şekilde bir tepki geliştirmemiş olması dikkat çekicidir. Bu nedenle olgunun tanısı cenaze manisi olarak değerlendirilmiştir. Olası yas tepkileri arasında nadir de olsa mani dönemi belirtilerinin görülebileceği unutulmamalıdır.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Recovery is the process of managing your addiction and mood disorder and making changes in your life.1 Recovery requires hard work, discipline, a commitment to change, and a willingness to address both of your disorders. Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

      "abstract": "Los estudios de neuroimagen funcional en el trastorno bipolar han descrito un patron de activacion reducida de regiones prefrontales junto con hiperactivacion en estructuras subcorticales. Una cuestion que esta sin resolver es la determinacion de los cambios dependientes del vs rasgo, es decir, si existen diferencias entre los episodios maniacos y depresivos, y hasta que punto los cambios observados persisten en eutimia. Ademas, los estudios hasta la fecha se han centrado principalmente en el estudio de las activaciones, y poco se sabe acerca de los cambios en la desactivacion. Dado que los cambios funcionales cerebrales en eutimia no estan directamente relacionados con los sintomas agudos de la mania o depresion, parece probable que reflejen otros aspectos del trastorno. Una posibilidad es que reflejen la vulnerabilidad a la enfermedad y, dado que uno de los principales factores de riesgo es la genetica, se plantea la cuestion de si los cambios cerebrales funcionales en eutimia tambien se puedan detectar en los familiares de pacientes que no han desarrollado el trastorno. Por otro lado, es posible que el deterioro cognitivo presente en eutimia se relacione con los cambios funcionales y/o estructurales cerebrales encontrados, pero hasta la fecha los resultados han sido inconsistentes.\nEl objetivo de este trabajo es, por tanto, examinar los cambios en el funcionamiento cerebral en cada una de las tres fases del trastorno bipolar; determinar que cambios en el funcionamiento cerebral estan presentes en familiares sanos de primer grado de los pacientes; y determinar si, y en que medida, el deterioro cognitivo en pacientes eutimicos se asocia con cambios cerebrales funcionales y/o estructurales.\n Nuestros resultados indican que los cambios funcionales cerebrales en el trastorno bipolar se pueden dividir en aquellos que estan relacionados con el estado y los que son marcadores rasgo. La corteza parietal mostro evidencia de pertenecer a la primera categoria mientras que la corteza prefrontal dorsolateral mostro una combinacion de ambas caracteristicas: exhibe una activacion reducida en ambas fases agudas de la enfermedad, pero sin normalizarse completamente en la eutimia. El fallo en la desactivacion en la corteza frontal medial, correspondiente con el nodo anterior de la red neuronal por defecto, mostro una clara evidencia de ser un marcador rasgo para el trastorno. Esta alteracion, se observo igualmente, pero de forma menos marcada, en los hermanos no afectados. Sin embargo, su disfuncion no parece ser responsable del deterioro cognitivo presente en el trastorno, que en cambio si que se relaciona con una activacion reducida en la corteza prefrontal dorsolateral derecha.\nEn conclusion, estos resultados ponen de relieve la implicacion de la red neuronal por defecto en el trastorno bipolar. Sin embargo, la naturaleza de esta disfuncion y su relacion con la sintomatologia de este trastorno es aun desconocida.",

The findings of this study are consistent with earlier reports that schizoaffectives are not greatly different from patients with other affective disorders in family history, treatment response, or long-term outcome.

SAD often has been used as a diagnosis for individuals having an admixture of mood and psychotic symptoms whose diagnosis is uncertain. Its hallmark is the presence of symptoms of a major mood episode (either a depressive or manic episode) concurrent with symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech.A literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted to identify articles on SAD. We also reviewed major textbooks and DSM-5 to identify pertinent information.This review begins with the history and classification of SAD. Debate continues to swirl around the concept, as some experts view SAD as an independent disorder, while others see SAD as either a form of schizophrenia or a mood disorder. The disorder is more common in women and its course follows the middle ground between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. SAD appears to have high heritability. Most patients appear to benefit from antipsychotics plus antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers, depending on whether the patient has the depressive or bipolar subtype. Electroconvulsive therapy can also be effective.SAD is a chronic psychotic disorder that continues to be controversial. There has been inadequate research regarding its epidemiology, course, etiologic factors, and treatment.",

Screening for MDD is recommended in the general adult population when resources are available for diagnosis, management, and follow-up. Several screening tools are available, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC). Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence. Referral to a psychiatrist or other mental health clinician should be considered when the diagnosis is in question or when symptoms do not improve with standard treatment.",

Dabei sind bis zu 150 verschiedene Symptome beschrieben worden, die diesem Syndrom zugeordnet werden konnen. Allein die Vielzahl der Symptome weist darauf hin, wie unscharf der Symptomenkomplex charakterisiert ist. We it unklarer als die klinische Beschreibung ist seine Pathophysiologie. Nach klinischen Gesichtspunkten spricht man von einem pramenstruellen Syndrom, wenn es urn die Beschreibung von psychischen oder somatischen Beschwerden geht, die pramenstruell auftreten und postmenstruell vollig verschwinden (Dalton 1985). Das pramenstruelle Syndrom war offensichtlich schon im klassischen Altertum bekannt. Bereits Hippokrates bezog Veranderungen der Gemiltslage in der pramenstruellen Phase auf ein Verhalten des Regelbluts. Die Regelblutung wurde als ReinigungsprozeB des Korpers und der Seele aufgefaBt. Zu den soma tisch en Beschwerden, die im Rahmen des pramenstruellen Syndroms gesehen werden, gehort die Odemneigung mit Gewichtszunahme, Brustspannen mit Mastodynie, Vollegefilhl mit Obstipationsneigung und Ubelkeit. Bei den psychovegetativen Symptomen stehen erhohte Reizbarkeit, Aggressivitat, Stimmungslabilitat, Angstlichkeit, Antriebsarmut, Schlaflosigkeit, Appetitveranderungen, gesteigerter Durst, Libidobeeintrachtigung, Konzentrationsund Koordinationsschwache im Vordergrund. Die Wesensveranderung kann so we it reichen, daB Kleptomanie, Pyromanie, Trunksucht, Nymphomanie und Halluzinationen beobachtet werden. Das pramenstruelle Syndrom gilt in GroBbritannien als strafmildern, in Frankreich gar als zeitweilige Unzurechnungsfahigkeit. Hinsichtlich der Pathophysiologie des pramenstruellen Syndroms gibt es eine Reihe von Hypothesen. Der zeitliche Zusammenhang zwischen der Menstruation und dem Auftreten dieses Syndroms lieB vermuten, daB eine gesWrte Ovarialfunktion mit veranderter Relation von Ostrogenund Progesteronsekretion ursachlich verantwortlich zu machen sei (Backstrom et al. 1976). Eine unzureichende sekretorische Umwandlung des J::ndometriums machte einen relativen Progesteronmangel zusatzlich wahrscheinlich. Damit wurde gleichzeitig ein relatives Uberwiegen der Ostrogenwirkung angenommen. Die gilnstigen therapeutischen Wirkungen einer Progesteronsubstitution schienen diese Hypothese zu bestatigen. In klinischen Studien, in denen serienmaBig Plasmaspiegel von Ostradiol und Progesteron bestimmt wurden, zeigte sich, daB das pramenstruelle Syndrom sowohl bei ovulatorischen als auch bei anovulatorischen Zyklen auftreten kann (Reid u. Yen 1981). Kritisch ist bei",

      "title": "Dysthymia: clinical and external validity",
      "abstract": "This paper reviews current evidence in support of dysthymia as a subaffective disorder that precedes major affective episodes, often by more than a decade. In cases beginning in childhood or adolescence, dysthymia is associated with high familial rates of mood disorders, and a recurrent pattern of superimposed major depression. At least two trait‐like markers, sleep electro‐encephalographic and thyroid axis abnormalities — similar to those in major affective disorder — have been reported. These data indicate a common pathophysiological substrate for both dysthymia and major depressive illness. All classes of antidepressants — most recently the serotonin re‐uptake and the reversible MAO inhibitors — have been shown to be effective. Dysthymia was fairly recently included in the US(DSM) and WHO(ICD) classifications of mental disorders, because it characterises a prevalent clinical presentation of depression in both psychiatric and general medical settings. Patients given this diagnosis, instead of presenting with acute or full‐blown episodes, often complain of low‐grade chronic affective malaise for as long as they remember, yet without clinically observable signs of depression. As a result, questions have been raised about its validity, but from fundamentally opposite positions: (i) Is dysthymia better conceptualised as a personality (or neurotic) rather than mood disorder? (ii) Can dysthymia be distinguished from major depressive illness? This paper examines these and related questions along both clinical and external validating strategies, and in particular, the more recent accumulated evidence in support of the utility of the concept of dysthymia.",

Es fand sich eine hohe Prävalenz von Zwangsstörungen entsprechend DSM-5-Kriterien, der Verlauf war häufig chronisch, aber langfristig war die Remissionsrate mit fast 60% höher als bisher angenommen. In Bezug auf die Komorbidität fanden sich generell hohe Raten an komorbiden Störungen und ein besonders enger Zusammenhang mit der sozialen Phobie.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

      "title": "Neurobiological outcomes in the offspring of postnatally depressed mothers: Causes and consequences",
      "abstract": "Postnatal depression (PND) is the most common psychological disorder to affect women in the postpartum period, with an estimated prevalence of 13% in high-income countries (Gavin et al. 2005; O’Hara and Swain 1996). In low and middle income countries, the available evidence suggests that rates of PND may be substantially higher, with prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 57% (Wachs et al. 2009). In terms of clinical presentation, depression occurring in the postnatal period appears to be indistinguishable from depression occurring at other times (Cooper et al., 2007), with persistent low mood and/or a profound loss of interest and enjoyment being defining characteristics. Other symptoms are mood-related disturbances in sleep, altered appetite, concentration impairment, retardation, agitation, feelings of guilt and hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or impulses. The duration of episodes varies, but the majority of postpartum depressive episodes resolve spontaneously within 6 months to a year (Cooper and Murray 1995; Cox et al. 1993). Although PND may not be unique in terms of the symptom profile, the fact that this disorder occurs in the postpartum period is a particular concern. Specifically, PND affects the mother–infant dyad at a time when the infant is particularly reliant on his or her caregiver to meet their physical, social, and cognitive needs. The postpartum period is also a time when the family unit as a whole is likely to experience additional stress, and is therefore particularly vulnerable. Given these considerations, and the relatively high prevalence of PND, the potential for adverse impact is significant. One area of research focus, reviewed here, has examined the possibility the disturbances in the mother–child relationship occurring in the context of maternal PND result in fundamental alterations in key psychobiological systems in the infant, with persistent consequences. Notably, as PND typically resolves within the first year postpartum, and therefore is particularly relevant to early development, observations deriving from the study of PND in this area offer potentially broad insights into the relevance of early environmental factors to child neurobiological functioning. Given that depressive disorder is characterized by profound impairments in mood, energy levels, motivation, and feelings of self-worth, and has established detrimental effects on interpersonal functioning, it is perhaps unsurprising that mothers with PND have been found to show disturbances in the quality of care that they provide for their infant (for a review, see Murray et al. 2010a).",

We must distinguish between this disease of the nervous system, which is one form of periodical insanity, and the physiological state in which the individual merely chances to indulge in liquor to excess. The great question of importance is to distinguish the two states or conditions when the result—intemperance—is the same. We must observe whether there are symptoms in our patient which can be referred to primary disease of the nervous system. We must examine for hereditary influences, which, when present, lead us, of course, to suspect disease. Early development of the appetite for stimulants points in the same direction; but the great diagnostic mark attending the<i>disease</i>is the irresistible impulse or craving, by which the patient is impelled to",

      "abstract": "Global hypoactivity contrasting with apparently unaffected cognitive abilities was initially reported in cases of frontal damage and is now recognized as a leading behavioral feature of many cerebral diseases. Of the various terms used to refer to this behavioral change, \"apathy\" is now the most widely used. Global hypoactivity with apathy is easy to diagnose in patients without other obvious neuropsychiatric impairments. In other clinical contexts, the diagnosis of global hypoactivity with apathy requires the physician to first establish that hypoactivity and loss of motivation cannot be more readily explained by sensorimotor impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with stroke or Parkinson's disease) or cognitive impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease). Many criteria and behavioral scales have been used to diagnose hypoactivity with apathy. The main differential diagnosis is depression and depressive symptoms, and distinguishing between these conditions and apathy may be particularly challenging. The mechanisms of hypoactivity with apathy remain uncertain and probably involve several dysfunctions, including the inability to attach motivational values to stimuli. We reviewed the frequency, characteristics, and determinants of hypoactivity with apathy in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, across the different stages of cognitive compromise. The diagnosis of this condition is an important step in identifying the source of difficulties in patients' activities of daily living.",

La EN es mas frecuente en varones y suele tratarse de una EN primaria y monosintomatica. La EN primaria es aquella en la que no se ha logrado continencia minima de seis meses de forma previa. La EN monosintomatica no se asocia a sintomas nefrourologicos diurnos. La EN suele relacionarse con comorbilidades como el estrenimiento, trastornos del sueno o el TDAH. La predisposicion genetica, los antecedentes personales nefrourologicos y los trastornos psicosociales son algunos de los factores de riesgo en la EN del nino. El diagnostico es clinico y se basa en una historia clinica detallada, exploracion fisica completa y diarios miccionales y de ingesta. El diagnostico diferencial es muy amplio, englobando otras patologias como diabetes mellitus, infeccion de orina, enfermedades nefrourologicas, oxiuros y alteraciones neurologicas. Las pruebas complementarias no estan indicadas de forma rutinaria si la exploracion fisica es normal y no existen signos de alarma. El tratamiento debe individualizarse e incluye educacion sanitaria, terapia motivacional, dispositivos de alarma y farmacos. Los dispositivos de alarma son de eleccion y requieren implicacion del paciente y la familia. La desmopresina se prefiere en ninos con menos de tres noches mojadas a la semana, volumen miccional maximo diurno (VMMD) superior al 75%, edad superior a 9 anos o fracaso del sistema de alarma. El pediatra tambien debera abordar los problemas psicologicos y sociales que puedan derivarse de la EN. EnglishNocturnal enuresis (NE) refers to nocturnal urinary incontinence that occurs at least once a month for three months in children aged five years old or older. NE is more common in males and is usually a primary and monosymptomatic NE. Primary NE is one in which a minimum continence of six months has not been achieved previously. Monosymptomatic NE is not associated with daytime nephro urological symptoms. NE is often associated with comorbidities such as constipation, sleep disorders or ADHD. Genetic predisposition, personal nephro urological history and psychosocial disorders are some of the risk factors for NE in children. Diagnosis is clinical and is based on a detailed medical history, complete physical examination, and voiding and drinking diaries. The differential diagnosis is very broad, encompassing other pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, nephro urological diseases, pinworms and neurological disorders. Complementary tests are not routinely indicated if the physical examination is normal and there are not warning signs. Treatment should be individualized and includes health education, motivational therapy, alarm devices, and drugs. Alarm devices are of choice and require patient and family involvement. Desmopressin is preferred in children with less than three wet nights per week, maximum voiding volume during day-time (MVVDT) greater than 75%, age greater than 9 years, or failure of the alarm system. The pediatrician will also need to solve psychological and social problems that may result from NE.",

      "title": "Die Beeinflussung des Langzeitverlaufs schizophrener Krankheiten durch somatotherapeutische Massnahmen",
      "abstract": "Controlled studies have revealed that neuroleptic treatment alone has a significant effect in schizophrenic patients and that with parenteral treatment with depot neuroleptics the relapse rate after 1 and 2 years is significantly lower than with oral neuroleptic medication. About 20% of schizophrenic patients do not have relapses even without treatment. The effectiveness of neuroleptic long-term medication with regard to the prevention of relapses was proved by discontinuation trials for a period of up to 3 years. Up to now, however, there is no proof that drug therapy influences the long-term prognosis beyond the 3 years. The results of the Bonn schizophrenia study show the extraordinary variability of the courses and outcomes. Although some anamnestic and clinical prognostically favourable or unfavourable factors could be found, a reliable individual prognosis at the onset of the disease is not possible. Initially phasic courses with complete remission of the early psychotic features can later nevertheless lead to residual syndromes; on the other hand, chronic persistent psychoses can show a permanent remission leaving only slightly, non-specific residual states even as late at the 2nd to the 4th decade of the disease independent of the therapy. Some findings of the Bonn study, indicating a favourable influence of psychical treatments on the long-term course are described. They include the so-called catastrophic schizophrenia which at a rate of 4% occurs less frequently than in the past, the significantly poorer long-term prognosis of those patients who had not been treated in the beginning of the disease (taking into account subgroups with peracute, acute and subacute onsets on the initial psychotic manifestations), the significantly less favourable long-term prognosis of patients whose disease began prior to the era of psychopharmacological drugs, and the significantly more frequent occurrence of complete remissions of patients of the subgroups with peracute and acute onsets of the psychosis who had started treatment within 1 year after the onset of the disease (including the prodromal stage). Early diagnosis and treatment of the prodromal symptoms can probably improve the chance of a complete remission. The finding of a higher rate of patients with mixed residual states at the expense of the typical schizophrenic defect psychoses within the partial subgroup of the specific residual states with long-term neurolepsy could suggest that long-term medication is responsible for the ‘partially pharmacogenic change in symptomatology’ of schizophrenia in as far as it causes or favours a shift from the typical syndromes to the mixed residual states mainly brought about by a potential reduction in symptoms.",

      "title": "PROGNOSTIC CRITERIA IN SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "On the basis of a critical survey of the literature, the following conclusions are drawn concerning the significance of the various criteria of prognosis in schizophrenia: The prognosis is most favorable when the duration of illness is short; the type of onset acute; exogenic precipitating factors, obvious; the element of confusion and the presence of atypical symptoms (especially manic-depressive symptoms), prominent in the early symptomatology; and when process symptoms are minimal or absent. Conversely, when these conditions are reversed, the prognosis is least favorable. This group of criteria is of the greatest import in the assessment of prognosis in schizophrenia. Certain other factors seem to have some significance, although their relative prognostic importance cannot be clearly evaluated at the present time. Patients with a history of a previous episode of illness appear to have a better chance of remission; the more so, the longer the interval of time between attacks, the more complete the recovery during the preceding remission, and the greater the dissimilarity between the present and previous episodes. The incidence of manic-depressive psychoses in the hereditary background may be related to the development of atypical symptoms and thus favorably influence the outcome of the illness. From a prognostic point of view, asthenic body type is unfavorable, pyknic favorable; due to possible technical error, caution is required in classification of body-type. Extravert temperament and adequate pre-psychotic life-adjustment offer a more favorable outlook, in contrast to introversion and inadequacy of reaction to life situations. However, it should be noted that evaluation of these factors on the basis of information obtained from relatives and friends is only approximate. In general, the catatonic subtype offers the best prognosis and paranoids the worst, with simple and hebephrenic subtypes in an intermediate position. Acute cases which are so atypical as not to allow classification under any of these four subtypes, are especially favorable prognostically. A progressive hospital course is ominous, whereas improvement or fluctuation is indicative of a more favorable outcome. Male or female sex, education and abilities, and psycho-sexual history seem to have no prognostic significance. Likewise the factor of age at onset of illness does not contribute to the assessment of outcome, except that relatively late age offers an unfavorable prognosis.",

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

      "abstract": "T HE mysterious disease known as epilepsy, with its cardinal symptoms of convulsions and loss of consciousness, is followed by a variety of mental disturbances, some permanent and others of only a transient character. It seems to make little or no difference whether the individual suffers from the mild or the severer type of convulsions, sooner or later he will show deterioration of the intellect, or the periodic occurrence of graver forms of insanity. Nevertheless, it may be stated as a general rule that the earlier the disease comes on, the greater the liability to mental deterioration and the more rapid the failure, while in those persons in whom the attacks begin in later years of life, the deteriorating process is much slower, owing to the stability of the nerve tracks acquired in infancy and youth. Epileptics who have had fits for years show a dimming of the reasoning faculties, defects of memory, alternations of character, a sinking to a lower plane of intelligence, and above all a tendency to impulsiveness and irritability. To this rule there are but infrequent exceptions. In many instances of the disease the epileptic is irritable even to violence, unmanageable, careless of the feelings of his family and friends, and is among the most difficult of mental cases to handle. As a general rule it may be stated that the more frequent the seizures, the more rapid the mental deterioration. There are, however, cases who have a great many attacks and who hold up mentally in a surprising manner in spite of the frequent assaults on the nervous system; again, there are cases with very infrequent seizures who deteriorate with great rapidity.",

Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related derivative medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications. For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus, the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence.

Disability associated with these conditions has also been reported. Our aim was to review the different definitions and to determine factors associated with these conditions in order to clarify the nosological implications of these disorders.A Medline search was conducted of the published literature between January 2001 and September 2011. Bibliographies of the retrieved papers were also analysed.There is a wide heterogeneity in the definition and diagnostic criteria of minor and subthreshold depression. Minor depression was defined according to DSM-IV criteria. Regarding subthreshold depression, also called subclinical depression or subsyndromal symptomatic depression, between 2 and 5 depressive symptoms were required for the diagnosis, and a minimum duration of 2 weeks. Significant impairment associated with subthreshold depressive conditions, as well as comorbidity with other mental disorders, has been described.Depression as a disorder is better explained as a spectrum rather than as a collection of discrete categories. Minor and subthreshold depression are common conditions and patients falling below the diagnostic threshold experience significant difficulties in functioning and a negative impact on their quality of life. Current diagnostic systems need to reexamine the thresholds for depressive disorders and distinguish them from ordinary feelings of sadness.",

Because there are no specific laboratory tests, however, its diagnosis relies exclusively on clinical criteria. The presence of dementia should be suspected whenever mental changes of insidious onset emerge without sufficient situational stress and gradually interfere with the daily living activities that are appropriate for age and background. Dementia can be reversible or irreversible, precipitously progressive or indolent, bristling with multiple cognitive deficits, or characterized almost exclusively by disturbances of affect, motivation, and personality. When the behavioral changes are dramatic and interfere with active careers in younger individuals, early diagnosis poses little difficulty. The real challenge arises among the elderly, in whom dementia is also far more common. This is because the elderly tend to have less demanding daily activities, the disruption of which may take longer to detect, and also because",

      "title": "Mixed dementia and hyperactive delirium: a diagnostic challenge",
      "abstract": "It is well recognised that acute confusion or delirium complicates up to 10% of acute medical admissions. Disorientation in time and place with an impaired short-term memory and conscious level are the hallmarks of an acute confusion. In delirium, disorders of perception may produce restlessness and agitation. A similar state during the final days of life is termed ‘terminal delirium’. Less than 10% of affected individuals will have a primary neurological disorder, for example, dementia, a neurodegenerative disease with varying aetiologies. Currently there are at least 50 million people globally suffering from dementia rendering it a global healthcare problem. Mixed dementia (MD) can be defined as a cognitive decline sufficient to impair independent functioning in daily life resulting from the coexistence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathology. MD occurs in patients with a neurodegenerative disorder, such as AD, Lewy body or Pick’s disease and additionally cerebrovascular disease. The mechanistic synergisms between the coexisting pathologies affecting dementia risk, progression and the ultimate clinical manifestations remain elusive. Although AD can be diagnosed with a considerable degree of accuracy, the distinction between isolated AD, vascular dementia and MD, when both pathologies coexist in the same patient remains one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges because their clinical presentation can overlap. Neuropathological studies indicate that mixed vascular Alzheimer’s dementia (MD) has a prevalence of 22% in the elderly. The authors present the case of a 78-year-old man with a diagnosis of MD presenting to the emergency department with delirium, a common but serious acute neuropsychiatric syndrome with the core features of inattention and global cognitive dysfunction. This case demonstrates the challenges in establishing a diagnosis in patients presenting with MD and shows that a cognitive assessment at presentation in a delirious state offers very little diagnostic information. It is therefore suggested to conduct a routine cognitive function examination on patients with dementia to anticipate new neurological signs and/or symptoms thus allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, a baseline cognitive assessment when the patient was well, duration and nature of deterioration as well as collateral history will help differentiate delirium from an underlying dementia.",

Consequences of CFS found include social isolation and stigmatization, physical inactivity, psychological disturb ances and a reduced quality of life. Plausible mechanism for the development of CFS is based on loss of immunological tolerance to the vasoactive neuropeptides following infection, significant physical exercise or de novo. Considerable evidence points towards a prominent role for central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CFS. Patients with CFS are described as perfectionist, conscientious, hardworking, somewhat neurotic and introverted individuals with high personal standards, a great desire to be socially accepted and with a history of continuously pushing themselves past their limits. Fewer than 20% of persons with CFS have been diagnosed and treated.

According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

      "title": "Bipolar Disorders",
      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is a recurring complex psychopathological mood disorder causing significant impairment in children. PBD spectrum includes bipolar I (full manic episode), bipolar II (depression with hypomania) and bipolar not otherwise specified (NOS) (“others” in mid-spectrum who may be exhibiting prodromal PBD states but do not fit criteria clearly).The clinical presentation of PBD often does not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for bipolar disorder (BD), which was developed in adults and not adapted for children. The diagnosis becomes difficult because symptom presentation is variable and largely dependent on developmental age. Although discrete episodes of mania and depression that define BD in adults may match the presentation of some patients who have BD in adolescence, patients who have BD of childhood and prepubertal onset may or may not manifest these clear-cut episodes. The duration of episodes in children may be as short as 1 to 2 days. Mood symptoms can be chronic, can present as predominantly mixed episodes, or can continuously cycle rapidly, with severe irritability or aggression as the usual presenting symptoms. Disruptive behavior, hyperarousal, racing thoughts, elation, and grandiosity also may characterize the moods. A major depressive presentation is associated with a significant risk for developing subsequent BD. Poor psychosocial skills as well as cognitive and attention deficits may manifest along with mood and behavior changes. The chronic relapsing mode of PBD may extend into early adulthood. Longitudinal studies abound on PBD; yet, there is no firm agreement on exactly what constitutes the diagnosis of PBD.Complicating the diagnosis of PBD is the high rate of comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, conduct, substance abuse, and oppositional defiant disorders. Children who have both PBD and ADHD tend to manifest a more severe course of illness, presenting with psychosis and comorbid depression often requiring hospitalization. Although both PBD and ADHD include symptoms of distractibility and hyperactivity, the distinguishing symptoms of mania, flight of ideas, decreased need for sleep, and exhibition of sexual tendencies are present in PBD but usually not in ADHD.PBD is thought to result from an interaction among genetic and environmental risk factors in which family environment is important. The genetic endowment of parents might contribute to the family dysfunction, predisposing already genetically affected offspring to evolution of the disorder. PBD is a highly heritable disorder having a documented genetic determinant, although its basis is not yet fully elucidated. Family history is the most significant risk factor for developing the illness. Studies show an increased risk of psychopathology in the offspring of parents who have BD. Early depression, anxieties, and dysregulated behavior may be useful markers for later development of BD in high-risk children. Those symptoms may be episodic. Some researchers suggest that PBD markers may be detectable almost a decade before the onset of the clinical disorder.Ongoing research is searching to identify PBD prodromes and early risk markers for the later developments of PBD. Clinical staging is proposed in identifying the PBD evolution among at-risk children. Early symptoms in the evolution include abnormalities in temperament, anxiety, sleep disruption, minor mood disturbance, difficulties with emotion regulation, and adjustment problems, progressing into mixed mood episodes, followed by frank bipolarity later in adolescence and adulthood. Heritable biomarkers in the areas of attention, executive function, and affect processing are subjects of ongoing research. There may be structural, functional, and biochemical alterations in the brain predisposing the child to mood instability.Research has suggested that physical, sexual, and emotional childhood traumas that occur at a time of sensitivity of the maturing central nervous system may predispose to and modulate the clinical expression and course of the PBD. Traumas cause organic changes in the brain that lead to mood dysregulation. These changes may result in a rapid cycling course, psychotic features, suicidal behavior, and an earlier age of onset, all of which induce a more severe clinical PBD profile. Traumas can result from any stressful event. Examples include behavioral, educational, family related, or substance abuse induced episodes; negative life events, such as low socioeconomic status, ongoing family conflicts, or low quality of life; or any disappointing life events such as school failure or termination of relationships.As many as two thirds of adults given a diagnosis of BP had symptoms beginning in childhood. This finding underscores the importance of risk and prodrome recognition, along with early and accurate diagnosis that allows intervention before full development of the highly impairing disorder. Expert agreements on what constitute key features and valid biomarkers for PBD diagnosis are needed.Comments: When reviewing community-based studies, the diagnosis of PBD has increased dramatically over the past decade. In retrospective studies in adults, 10% to 20% revealed the onset of symptoms when they were younger than 10 years of age, and 60% when younger than 20 years, with most self-reporting a delay of 10 years in making the diagnosis. Although unfortunate, this finding may not be surprising, because there are less clear diagnostic criteria for children and because pediatricians have not been trained to consider this diagnosis. Early diagnosis is important in order to initiate appropriate treatment and minimize morbidity and mortality, such as through suicide. As pediatricians, we need to consider the diagnosis in children who exhibit irritability and aggression, and a family history of bipolar disease is important to determine. Future research is needed to better examine treatment options in children and whether earlier treatment will result in better outcomes. The challenge of managing PBD is yet another example of the importance of mental health training for pediatricians and for collaboration with mental health providers to provide the best possible care to our patients.Janet Serwint, MDConsulting Editor, In Brief",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), historically referred to as pseudoseizures or hysterical seizures, are sudden disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, or emotional functions that can mimic epileptic seizures. PNES have a psychologic etiology related to dissociative disorders or conversion disorders, as opposed to the abnormally excessive neuronal activity found in epileptic seizures. Psychosocial conflicts are essentially converted into physical symptoms, resulting in seizure-like symptoms. This case report presents a 42-year-old male with a past history of child abuse, drug abuse, schizoaffective disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was admitted to the behavioral health unit with recurrent seizure-like episodes. These episodes were witnessed in the ED, however, appropriate workup failed to confirm abnormal neural activity or evidence of any brain injury. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric service where he was monitored for additional epileptic activity using long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (LT-VEEG). While subsequent clinical events that resembled epileptic seizures were observed, the LT-VEEG failed to identify any epileptic activity. A diagnosis of PNES was established and a decision was made for the patient to remain on his current antiepileptic, psychiatric, and diabetes medications during his hospitalization. He showed gradual improvement during his stay and confirmed an understanding of his diagnosis. He was released three days later with instructions for follow-up and continued treatment with his outpatient psychiatrist. Early therapeutic counseling in patients who have a differential diagnosis of PNES should be considered to help identify and address the underlying causes of the seizure activity in an effort to curtail these seizure-like events.",

      "title": "What is dementia?",
      "abstract": "Dementia is a descriptive term derived from the Latin root de mens, indicating an observable decline in mental abilities. It is an acquired clinical syndrome characterised by deterioration of mental functioning in its cognitive, emotional and conative aspects. The concept is comprehensive with several different clinical profiles and courses. The diagnosis of dementia implies that several mental faculties are involved and exclude isolated neuropsychiatric disturbances such as amnesia and aphasia which occur with focal brain lesions. Description and classification of dementia conditions have however to deal with the problem that the word \"dementia\" might have different meanings in different contexts. It might denote a clinical syndrome irrespective of etiology, but also imply that the etiology of this syndrome is brain dysfunction. Moreover, the term dementia is sometimes used in a wider sense to describe the underlying brain disease from its early subtle manifestations to advanced stages of severe deterioration. By definition this deterioration previously was progressive and irreversible with little hope for the patient. Clinical experience however has changed our views, and it is now accepted that the course of dementia can be progressive, static or remittent.",

During the eight years of illness, the patient suffered from polymorfic psychotic states accompanied by various types of epileptic seizures, including absence and grand-mal seizures, resistant to drug therapy. In addition, he suffered from multiple motor disorders, skeletal and mimiс muscle atrophy, as well as progressive cognitive decline from very high level of cognitive functions to level of moderate deterioration. Despite repeated evaluations, there was no unequivocal diagnosis of his disorder. Objectives Male, born in 1994, without a known hereditary pathology in the field of neurology or psychiatry. Pregnancy and childbirth proceeded without features and the early stages of cognitive-motor development were marked as normative, with the exception of a single epileptic seizure at the age of 3 years (according to the description of the parents). Until the age of 16, the patient was not under the supervision of a neurologist or psychiatrist, developed on a par with his peers, successfully attended school with high marks in the exact sciences, and went in for sports. Methods Case report Results Case report Conclusions A patient is considered with a non-standard course of psychosis and epilepsy, which was accompanied by multiple neurological and psychiatric symptoms.In Israel there are only 13 patients with a resemble clinical picture and there is no diagnosis or group of diagnoses in ICD, DSM or any neulogical classificatin tha can describe his disease.",

      "title": "PORPHYRIA—A DECEPTIVE SYNDROME",
      "abstract": "Most \"organic brain syndromes\" are not difficult to diagnose. However, some \"organic\" states resemble schizophrenia, and this is particularly true of the acute intermittent type of porphyria. Here, the variable pain and paralysis and the prominent psychic changes can easily lead to errors in diagnosis —as recounted in the cases presented—unless this classical triad is kept in mind as being characteristic of porphyria. Early diagnosis would prevent unnecessary surgery and psychotherapy, the administration of drugs which can precipitate an attack, and even commitment as a schizophrenic. It is likely that there are undiagnosed porphyrics in the present mental hospital population of this country; we should therefore routinely do a Watson test on any patient—especially the young female—who is troubled with unusual abdominal pain and any sort of psychic disorder, with or without any concomitant neurological symptoms being present. Little mention has been made of this disease in the past, because it has been thought to be very rare. However, an average of more than one case a year is seen at our 1,000-bed hospital, and it has often been shown in the past that when attention is focused upon supposedly \"rare\" diseases they are found to be much more common than previously supposed.",

      "abstract": "The disruption of psychosocial functioning (PSF) is currently listed as one of the DSM IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and PSF is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of successful treatment of the disease. Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.

Johnson-Greene, D.Abulia Associated with Unilateral Anterior Communicating Artery CVA: A Case Study.Abulia is a term with several historical meanings, one of which is a clinical syndrome primarily associated with bilateral frontal lobe lesions such as those associated with closed head injury.In its most severe form, abulia involves the absence of volitional behavior in the form of tourism (i.e., akinetic mutism) and severe psychomotor retardation (akinesia).Despite intact wakefulness, patients with abulia are often immobile, mute, they do not express emotion, and they are unresponsive to commands or questions.A temporary reversal of these deficits can sometimes be triggered through the use of a telephone (telephone effect) and there may be brief unexpected transient periods of normal conversation and behavior (paradoxical performance).Despite abulia's neurological underpinnings, particularly in more mild cases, is often incorrectly interpreted as depression.For this reason, abulia represents a unique diagnostic quandary for clinical neuropsychologists.We examined a 75-year-old right-handed male with a history of previous right parietal CVA, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, and positive RPR and FTA who presented to the ER with sudden inability to communicate and new right-side weakness.Upon admission to the rehabilitation unit, he was found to have akinetic mutism, akinesia, and flat affect, which resulted in a referral for evaluation of possible depression.A CT scan shortly after admission revealed a new left infarction in the vicinity of the left anterior communicating artery (ACA).Differential diagnosis was complicated initially by the patient's mutism and inability to engage in yes/no responding with eye blinks or head nods.Early during his rehabilitation, he failed to show a favorable response to antidepressant medication.The patient displayed both paradoxical performance and the telephone effect, the latter of which became quite useful during the course of rehabilitation as a modality for both assessment and treatment activities.This case highlights the importance of careful differential diagnosis as well as potential modalities for assessment and treatment of patients with abulia.Further, this case represents a rare occurrence of abulia developing following a unilateral frontal lobe impairment.",

      "abstract": "A substantial proportion of patients in general practice consult for subjective symptoms, such as pain or fatigue, without corresponding objective findings.1–4 Some of these patients present trivial symptoms that do not indicate disease; others recover after long-lasting symptoms and disability. Here, we shall refer to conditions with long-lasting and disabling symptoms, not trivial or passing symptoms. Such conditions are called medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Syndromes with specific diagnostic criteria, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome, are often included among MUS conditions.2\n\nAlthough management of patients with MUS presents several challenges, GPs accept the responsibility for investigation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.5\n\nBiopsychosocial approaches are commonly applied in medical practice, whether the aim is full recovery or coping with symptoms and disability,1 and psychologically based interventions (especially different cognitive behavioural therapies [CBT]) have been developed for coping and symptom relief. Yet, such approaches do not substantiate MUS as a mental disorder. Lamahewa et al found, for example, that comorbidity with depression and generalised anxiety disorder occurred in only one-third of these patients.2 Studies have evaluated effects of CBT on different outcome measures, such as pain, function, work ability, or healthcare use, often presenting limited or no significant effects based on weak evidence.4\n\nMUS is not a clinical diagnosis but an analytical concept, unifying a diverse group of health problems where no joint cause or biomarker have been identified. Together MUS conditions dispute the idea that objective findings are needed to confirm subjective symptoms as disease. The biomedical disease model has imposed an unfortunate body–mind duality, with illness categorised as psychological when no objective findings are identified.2,4 Conceptualising MUS …",

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

Data regarding the relationship between ToM, and other cognitive skills, symptoms, and the impact of the state of illness were reviewed.ToM instruments used in schizophrenia spectrum disorders have some major psychometric limitations; however, previous research was still able to provide some important findings regarding mentalizing impairments in schizophrenia. While ToM deficits are more pronounced in the acute phase of illness, it seems to persist during periods of remission. There is also evidence of ToM deficits in the healthy relatives of schizophrenics, patients with delusional disorder and bipolar disorder (BD), and individuals with high schizotypy scores. ToM dysfunction might be secondary to other cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia that have a good prognosis, asymptomatic schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and BD. Other cognitive deficits do not seem to explain ToM dysfunction in patients with psychosis and severe negative symptoms. These findings support the contribution of impairment in both domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms to ToM deficits in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. ToM deficits may be important for understanding poor social functioning and poor insight in psychotic disorders.While ToM is influenced by state variables, it might be an endophenotype of schizophrenia; however, ToM is likely to be an indicator of other frontal lobe-related endophenotypes. Longitudinal studies conducted with high-risk individuals are particularly important.",

Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

      "title": "Análisis evolutivo y valoración neuropsicológica integral de pacientes con deterioro cognitivo leve o enfermedad de Alzheimer.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "abstract": "Of 842 consecutive patients with movement disorders seen over a 71 month period, 28 (3.3%) were diagnosed as having a documented or clinically established psychogenic movement disorder. Tremor was most common (50%) followed by dystonia, myoclonus, and parkinsonism. Clinical descriptions of various types are reviewed. Clinical characteristics common in these patients included distractability (86%), abrupt onset (54%), and selective disabilities (39%). Distractability seems to be most important in tremor and least important in dystonia. Other diagnostic clues included entrainment of tremor to the frequency of repetitive movements of another limb, fatigue of tremor, stimulus sensitivity, and previous history of psychogenic illness. On examination, 71% had other psychogenic features. Over 60% had a clear history of a precipitating event and secondary gain and 50% had a psychiatric diagnosis (usually depression). Twenty five per cent of patients presented with combined psychogenic movement disorder and organic movement disorder; 35% resolved and this subgroup had a shorter duration of disease than those who are unresolved. Psychogenic movement disorder represents an uncommon diagnosis among patients with movement disorders. The ability to make a diagnosis rests on the presence of a multitude of clinical clues and therapeutic action should be taken as early as possible.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

The pronounced and persistent affect, in particular depression in conjunction with hallucinations and/or delusions throughout the whole episode, served as the basis for an episode qualification as the schizoaffective structure. Diagnosis of schizophrenia was confirmed by the extremely low socio-demographic indicators at the time of the manifest episode, by the presence of catatonic or catatono-oneiroid symptoms in more than half of the patients, as well as an incongruence of hallucination plot and/or delusions against the dominant affect. In most cases, the affective symptoms were detected in clinical presentation of a prodrome and significantly more often in the form of depression, in comparison with bipolar and mixed affective disorders. Different clinical manifestations of negative symptoms were revealed in significantly more than half of the patients. The study showed that there is a significant frequency of negative manifestations in conjugation with depression in the prodrome.",

      "title": "Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptom and related disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent physical symptoms or complaints that are associated with significant distress and impairment. The conceptualization of these disorders under the category of somatoform disorders in DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000) required that these somatic presentations lack objective organic causes. This latter requirement has been deleted in DSM-5, largely because somatic symptoms often do have related medical conditions (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Even when such associations have not been established, the assumption that they are present has often led to patients being labeled in pejorative ways, as if they are faking symptoms or somehow responsible for their own suffering. The seven disorders encompassed in the DSM-5 category of somatic symptom and related disorders are somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. DSM-IV disorders that are subsumed under this new nomenclature include somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and factitious disorders (which appeared in their own separate category in DSM-IV). Body dysmorphic disorder is not included in the new somatic symptom disorder category and is now classified as one of the other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Prevalence rates in the literature for what were previously labeled somatoform disorders varied by diagnosis, but in general and across ages these disorders have been seen in 16% of primary care outpatients and in 23% of outpatients with medically unexplained symptoms (de Waal et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005). A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV diagnoses in a sample of patients suggests that prevalence rates are similar across the old and new nomenclatures (Voigt et al. 2012). Older individuals with somatic symptom and related disorders are seen in all health care settings, where they frequently overuse medical services and overburden general practitioners (de Waal et al. 2008; Puri and Dimsdale 2011). They often come to the attention of a geriatric psychiatrist after another clinician has attempted unsuccessfully to resolve their physical symptoms. To date, the somatic symptom and related disorders have not been well studied in late life, in part because many of the disorders tend to begin in early adulthood. In addition, research involving older cohorts has usually focused on reported somatic symptoms rather than on specific diagnoses. A complicating factor is that somatoform symptoms in late life are often obscured by comorbid physical and psychiatric illnesses. In particular, these disorders have been strongly associated with stress, depression, anxiety, psychological trauma, substance abuse, and personality disorders (de Waal et al. 2004; Haftgoli et al. 2010; Hasin and Katz, 2007; Sack et al. 2007; Tomenson et al. 2012). DSM-5 is trying to make the diagnoses more parsimonious by eliminating the requirement for medically unexplained symptoms, but additional research is needed to further elucidate their characteristics under the new nomenclature.",

Other late-life mental disorders, however, have also been associated with EPS. To examine whether EPS are increased in DAT patients relative to neuropsychiatric control subjects, the authors compared EPS in 127 neuroleptic-free elderly patients diagnosed with either DAT, major depressive disorder (MDD), or a psychotic disorder (SCHIZ/DELUS). They also examined whether depressive or psychotic symptoms were associated with EPS independently of diagnosis. Severity of parkinsonian rigidity was found to be independently associated with DAT. Rank order of rigidity was DAT>MDD> SCHIZ/DELUS. Bradykinesia, although not associated with diagnostic group, was positively correlated with withdrawn depression. These findings suggest that rigidity is associated with DAT independently of any concurrent psychotic or depressive process, whereas bradykinesia does not appear to be specific to DAT among late-life neuropsychiatric illnesses.",

Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "Introduction/Rationale: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with a higher prevalence of mood and psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder (BD). While mania is most often associated with BD, MS can also induce manic symptoms. However, it is crucial to distinguish which condition is causing mania since medical management is different based on its etiology. Herein, we report a case of a manic episode in a middle-aged female with a prolonged history of BD who received a recent diagnosis of MS 1 year ago. Patient Concerns: A 56-year-old female presented with an episode of mania and psychosis while receiving a phenobarbital taper for chronic lorazepam use. She had a prolonged history of bipolar type 1 disorder and depression. She showed optic neuritis and was diagnosed with MS a year prior. Diagnoses: The patient was diagnosed with BD-induced mania based on the absence of increased demyelination compared to previous MRI and lack of new focal or lateralizing neurologic findings of MS. Interventions: Lithium was given for mood stabilization and decreased dosage of prior antidepressant medication. Risperidone was given for ongoing delusions. Outcomes: After 8 days of hospitalization, patient's mania improved but demonstrated atypical features and ongoing delusions. She was discharged at her request to continue treatment in an outpatient setting. Conclusion/Lesson: In BD patients with an episode of mania, MS should be included in the differential, since both conditions can cause manic symptoms. The origin of mania should be delineated through a detailed neurological exam, neuroimaging, and thorough patient-family psychiatric history for appropriate clinical treatment.",

There is in the literature not a single instance in which any reference is made to the role of emotional factors in this disturbance. The case presented is a classic case of stress incontinence. Since childhood the patient had always been incontinent when coughing, exerting herself, or running. After several operations her symptoms worsened, the incontinence being almost complete and activity entirely precluded. Nocturnal enuresis also appeared. Psychological investigation revealed emotional immaturity after an unhappy childhood with many frustrations. There was no opportunity for deeper psychological treatment and supportive psychotherapy aided by hypnosis for symptom removal was used. The symptoms disappeared, the patient was able to return to social life and was still active 3 years later.",

Diathesis-stress hypothesis of schizophreniaSchizophrenia is a complex illness, and its possible causes are still subject of debate.However, according to a widely adopted view, both a biological predisposition, and exposure to environmental stress are necessary ingredients for schizophrenia to become manifest -the so-called diathesis stress model (Zubin & Spring, 1977).A classical example of the association between environmental stress and the risk of developing schizophrenia, comes from studies of the 1944-1945 Dutch Hunger Winter (Susser & Lin, 1992;Susser et al., 1996;Susser et al., 1998).In this discrete period during the Second World War, there was a serious decline in food intake in six cities of western Netherlands.Among people born in these cities between 1944 and 1946, the most exposed birth cohort (i.e., conceived at the height of the famine) showed a twofold and statistically significant increase in the risk for developing schizophrenia (Susser & Lin, 1992).Since this particular famine, many others occurred worldwide, but these were less suitable for epidemiological investigations due to more disorganized conditions (St Clair et al., 2005).However, several years after the Dutch Hunger Winter, a similar occasion occurred in China.Specifically, from 1959-1961, people in affected provinces were starving and died in large numbers due to bad weather (for refs see (St Clair et al., 2005)).Among births that occurred during the famine years, the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life was significantly increased when compared to those born before or afterwards (St Clair et al., 2005).These 'natural experiments' suggest that prenatal stress, i.e., exposure to maternal nutritional deficiency, could increase the risk of schizophrenia in later life.However, evidence from many observational studies that have investigated the association between experience of stress in adulthood and acute onset of psychotic illness, has not been confirmative (Phillips et al., 2007).In particular, there is no consistent evidence that experience of stressful life events is able to trigger onset of psychosis.Findings from longitudinal studies on the other hand, are stronger in linking episodes of relapse in schizophrenia patients to an elevated rate of stressful life events (Phillips et al., 2007;Walker et al., 2008), thus providing additional evidence for a role of stress exposure in (the course of) schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

Epidemiological data estimate that at least 5% of people with type I bipolar disorder never experienced depression. These subjects are more often males with a hyperthymic temperament, a younger age at onset, and more psychotic features. Current classification systems do not formally recognize UM, but different definitions of mania without depression have been proposed. UM should be assessed according to the number of mood episodes, the predominance of manic or hypomanic episodes, and its clinical course. More generally, UM should be considered in the context of an affective spectrum including different clinical phenotypes based on the predominance of depressive or manic symptoms. Additional clinical and epidemiological research in this field is needed.",

They can ruin their lives, and their habits create an underworld willing and able to exploit them. Some people become alcoholics. The chapter discusses about schizophrenia disorder. The primary characteristic of schizophrenia is the impairment of logical thought processes. Speech is often bizarre and confused, reflecting a disturbed mind. Thoughts that are usually only remotely connected emerge together in speech (loose associations), and in extreme cases speech may be completely incomprehensible. Depression is another behavioral disorder. It is diagnosed as being either primarily endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous form of depression refers to severe depression that occurs in the absence of any identifiable external source; the exogenous form of depression results from external stresses.",

      "title": "ESP and Altered States of Consciousness: An Overview of Conceptual and Research Trends",
      "abstract": "Parapsychological phenomena has a long tradition of being associated with alterations of consciousness. This tradition extends from the performances of ancient oracles and other diviners to the mesmeric and mediumistic trance, and to more recent claims in the context of laboratory work that used hypnotic suggestion, dreams, meditation, and partial sensory deprivation. Moreover, there has been a long tradition of spontaneous ESP experiences related to dreams and other states of consciousness that have reinforced such associations. In this paper, I will present an overview of the topic of ESP and altered states of consciousness (ASCs). I will not focus on methodological details or specific findings, but, rather, on trends in concepts and research. Other publications cited throughout this paper provide more detailed information (see, e.g Bem & Honorton, 1994; Hardy, 1989; Honorton, 1977; Krippner, 1991; Krippner & George, 1986; Parker, 1975b; Stanford, 1987, 1992; Stanford & Stein, 1994). For practical reasons, I do not discuss mesmerism nor spiritualism in detail, and I do not address other areas such as the psychoanalytic dream ESP literature (e.g., Devereux, 1953). The discussion here will be limited to developments which occurred between the nineteenth century and the 1990s, with an emphasis on twentieth century developments and those since the 1960s. Although I am not suggesting that there are no differences between specific altered states, nor between the concept of dissociation and that of alteration of consciousness, I use the term ASCs in a general sense meaning any state of mind that differs markedly enough from that which we associate with our normal waking selves (Parker, 1975b, p. 8). Depending on definitions, such phenomena as alternating personalities may be considered a form of consciousness alteration, and body image changes during the ganzfeld experience may be seen as a dissociative process in which physical sensations have been separated from conscious awareness. My concern is not to get into these problems of definition, but to represent trends in the literature and general ideas of authors. I hope that what I present will be used by others to clarify our understanding of these concepts. THE NINETEENTH CENTURY Several movements contributed significantly to interest in the relationship between ESP and ASCs. These were mesmerism, spiritualism, and dynamic psychiatry. (For overviews of these topics, see Ellenberger, 1970; Gauld, 1992; and Podmore, 1902). By the middle of the nineteenth century, mesmerism had accumulated a considerable literature, as seen in the writings of Mesmer (Bloch, 1980) and many other workers in the field (e.g., Braid, 1843; Elliotson, 1843; Petetin, 1808).(1) Many observations also focused on clairvoyance and the like (Elliotson, 1845; Haddock, 1851). This period produced many other claims, such as transpositions of the senses, traveling clairvoyance, face-to-face or distant medical diagnosis, seeing the mesmeric fluid around the mesmerist or between the mesmerist and the mesmeree, induction of trance at a distance, and the so-called community of sensation reported between mesmerist and mesmeree (Dingwall, 1967-1968; Gauld, 1992). Some of these phenomena, especially the claim of mesmerized subjects to see the afterworld or to be in contact with deceased or other spirit individuals, provided a link with the later development of spiritualism. As Crabtree (1988) has argued: In Germany, France, England and the United States, the association between magnetic somnambulism and paranormal phenomena of the spiritualistic type was very strong. Many of the books and articles that appeared wove their way back and forth between the two areas, giving the impression that it was impossible to discuss one without dealing with the other. (p. xv) The development of spiritualism changed the focus from mesmerized individuals to those individuals who, in self-induced trances, claimed to communicate with the deceased, and thus reinforced the idea that ASCs were related to ESP (for a review, see Podmore, 1902). …",

      "title": "Mood and affect",
      "abstract": "Readers are grateful to Macpherson and Hikida1 for helping us understand the role of the basal ganglia in various mental disorders. In listing the symptoms of major depressive disorder, they mention, ‘low mood (also known as “flat affect”).’ This is a common mistake. Low mood refers to the feeling/internal emotional state of the individual – it is a symptom. It is a subjective matter and if the individual states that his/her mood is low, we are obliged to accept that assessment (we might, of course, comment that the signs are or are not consistent with the statement). The term ‘affect,’ when used in the assessment of the mental state, refers to the external manifestations of an internal feeling state – here, affect is a sign. (The term ‘affect’ is also sometimes used as an alternative to ‘mood,’ as is ‘affective disorders,’ but this is archaic and not much used currently.) The term ‘flat affect’ was coined to describe a sign of chronic schizophrenia. This largely refers to the unvarying immobile face and slow-moving body often associated with a loss (or absence) of emotional experience/life. It is a negative symptom. But ‘flat’ here is not interchangeable with ‘low’ – the important additional aspect is that the external manifestation does not vary. Where there is flat affect it is usually difficult to get an emotional response (reciprocal emotional response) from the patient. The face and behavior of the individual with a low mood may be similar, at times, to that of the person with schizophrenia with negative symptoms. However, the underlying processes are different. In one there is low mood, in the other there is absence of emotion. The external features (affect) associated with low mood revert to normal when the mood disorder resolves. The flat affect of schizophrenia changes little in response to treatment. Low mood and flat affect are distinct entities – ‘mood’ refers to subjective experience and ‘affect’ refers to objective evidence. Low mood is not always accompanied by psychomotor retardation (which limits facial and bodily movement) and the flat affect of schizophrenia may not be accompanied by low mood. The author has no conflicts of interest to declare.",

      "abstract": "Los trastornos bipolares se caracterizan por episodios de mania y depresion, que pueden alternar, aunque en muchos pacientes predomina uno sobre el otro. Se desconoce la causa exacta, pero puede estar implicado la herencia, cambios en las concentraciones de los neurotransmisores cerebrales y factores psicologicos. El diagnostico se basa en la anamnesis. Es un trastorno del estado de animo, en el que los pacientes presentan ciclos alternantes de elevacion o exaltacion (mania o hipomania) o de apagamiento o depresion (1).\r\nEl trastorno bipolar tipicamente comienza en la adolescencia o durante la temprana adultez y continua a traves de toda la vida. Frecuentemente no es reconocida como una enfermedad y las personas que tienen la enfermedad pueden sufrir innecesariamente por anos o por decadas (2).\r\nLa enfermedad bipolar ha sido diagnosticada en ninos(as) menores de 12 anos de edad, aunque no es comun durante esta etapa de la ninez. Puede ser confundida con el trastorno del deficit de la atencion y del comportamiento perturbador, por lo tanto, un diagnostico cuidadoso es necesario (3).\r\nEste trastorno afecta a alrededor de 60 millones de personas en todo el mundo. Se suele caracterizar por la alternancia de episodios maniacos y depresivos separados por periodos de estado de animo normal. Durante los episodios de mania, el paciente presenta un estado de animo exaltado o irritable, hiperactividad, verborrea, autoestima elevada y una disminucion de la necesidad de dormir. Las personas que presentan solamente episodios maniacos y no sufren fases depresivas tambien se clasifican dentro del diagnostico de trastorno bipolar (4).\r\nExisten medicamentos que estabilizan el estado de animo con los que se puede detener eficazmente las fases agudas del trastorno bipolar y prevenir las recidivas. Ademas, el apoyo psicosocial es un elemento esencial del tratamiento (5).",

Secondary causes of dystonia have accompanying neurological deficits or an identifiable structural or metabolic lesion. Classification of dystonia based on etiology has undergone extensive modifications as new genetic bases for some forms of dystonia and other primary neurological diseases have been identified. (Chapters 3 and 8). Secondary dystonia can be further classified into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifiable brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain. The dystonia plus syndromes (1) have accompanying neurological signs and/or clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of neurochemical disorders, without evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative process (Table 1).",

      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are frequently reported during the period preceding the onset of schizophrenia in adolescents when such symptoms can be mistaken for those of mood disorder. However, it is unclear which emotional symptoms should be considered predictive of schizophrenia onset. The types of emotional disturbances that may precede schizophrenic disorder were sought through a review of historical descriptive studies and seminal works using a phenomenological approach. Five main types of emotional disturbances have been found as prodromal symptoms of a schizophrenic disorder: (1) increased sensitivity to stress, (2) poor or incomplete expression of emotions, (3) reduced emotion sharing, (4) emotional detachment, and (5) disconnection between the perception and expression of emotions. Studies based on phenomenological views of schizophrenic disorders stressed the chronological sequence of these symptoms in the same person. For example, the term “delusional mood” (Wahnstimmung) coined to describe changes in the perceived atmosphere encompass mood disturbances from subtle emotional overreactivity to more severe symptoms that could evoke athymhormia. Analysis of recent studies among subjects at high-risk for psychotic transition showed that the presence of mood symptoms at a very early stage of the disorder is common. While these symptoms predict a lower level of general functioning, they were not associated with a higher risk of developing a schizophrenic disorder at follow-up.

He had three subsequent falls to the ground with no dizziness, vertigo, weakness or sensory disturbance.

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is the most common of disabling neurological conditions, and seizures are among the most common of neurological symptoms. Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

      "abstract": "The search for animal models of depressive illness presents a most difficult task even though it may periodically appear that suitably reliable compounds for the treatment of depressive illness are within grasping distance. Research strategies for understanding the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of depressive disorders remain among the most varied, confused and strenuous pursuits in the neuropharmacology of drug development. Any attempt to produce an animal model must be considered very much a pragmatic effort but this consideration in no way decreases the necessity of continued search: pragmatism has generally provided great benefits for the suffering. Among the many reasons for the failures to obtain completely reliable and valid animal models of depression, one may consider the enormous complexity of the disorder, as for example illustrated by the distinction between bipolar and unipolar illness in affective disorders. Thus, the bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of both major depression and mania whereas the unipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of major depression. Other types of affective disorders related to depressive illness (as outlined and reviewed in DSM HI) include cyclothymic disorder, involving varying periods of depression and hypomania, dysthymic disorder, a chronic mood disorder less severe than major depression, and, seasonal affective disorders. The existing test models and bioassays simply cannot cope with complexity of this order: one must therefore weight the term 'animal model' most stringently before applying it and in most cases make a preferred reference to 'drug screens'.

These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis canbe difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially,he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and internal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active temporal focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously.

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are frequent in dementia and often precede cognitive dysfunction. Their prevalence is difficult to establish because of differences in definitions, methodology, scales or origin of information. They result from a dysfunction in fronto-subcortical, striato-limbic and paralimbic structures involved in neurodegenerative disorders. In elderly people, 40-70% of the population has a mood disorder, and among them 15-25% a major depression. Accompanied cognitive deficits constitute the debated entity of pseudodementia or dementia syndrome of depression. This is a fuzzy field and the reversibility of the cognitive deficits is far from having been proved, 60-89% of tardive depression evolve toward dementia and only 5% of depressive state are identified as the first symptom of dementia or interpreted as changes in personality; no test or brain imaging technique can help in the diagnosis. Depression is the second most symptom in Alzheimer's disease and a common presenting symptom with a continuum between dysthymia (20-50%) and major depression (10-30%) and has even been interpreted as a factor for Alzheimer's disease. Apathy (50-80%), verbal aggressivity, agitation (40-60% ), emotional lability or abrupt changes in mood, irritability and violence are commonly associated with mood disorders in Alzheimer's disease. Anxiety is frequent (4%), but manic states or euphoria are exceptional. With the evolution of the disease, the prevalence of depression decreases. In Lewy body disease the prevalence of depression is the same as in Alzheimer's disease, anxiety is less frequent, violence is reported in 20%, psychomotor agitation in 60%. In fronto-temporal dementia changes in personality and social or instinctual behaviour are accompanied by some degree of depression (80% ), apathy (50-70%), disinhibition, insouciant euphoria (10-30%), loss of empathy or concern about the consequence of one's acts, blunting of affectivity, irritability or disorders of impulse control and sometimes manic states. In vascular dementia depression is more frequent than in Alzheimer's disease, apathy and mood fluctuations also. AIDS dementia is mostly apathetic or manic. Parkinsonism and dementia associate apathy and depression, anxiety and dysphoric states. In Huntington's chorea, disorders of impulse control, anxiety and severe depression with a risk of suicide 8-10 times higher than in the normal population are frequent in the beginning of the disease. Apathy is generally found in terminal stages of the disease. Multiple sclerosis with cognitive deficits, dementia due to sarcoidosis, Behcet's, Whipple's and Sjogren's diseases and idiopathic calcification of the basal ganglia are associated with depression, aggressivity, irritability and manic states. Occasionally, B 1 2 deficiency can present with depression or mania, hydrocephaly is commonly associated with depression and apathy. Wilson's disease is known to present with disorders of impulse control, depression, anxiety, emotional lability, aggressivity, apathy or manic states. Treatment of mood disorders in dementia generally responds to tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs or adrenergic selective antidepressants. Agitation is best treated with clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone, but the latter and classic neuroleptics may be harmful in Lewy body disease. Paradoxical reactions to sedatives are sometimes encountered, but diazepines and clomethiazole may be used.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "The concept of adjustment disorder (or a group of adjustment disorders) has a long history, though what is actually meant by the term has changed over time. Originally, as ‘adjustment reaction’, it was one of a very few disorder categories included in major psychiatric classification schemes specifically for use in children and adolescents. In DSM-I, for instance, adjustment reaction and childhood schizophrenia were the only two categories of childhood psychiatric disorder. The intention was to indicate that some instances of disordered behaviour or emotions arose specifically because of an identified stressor rather than, say, a process of mental illness. The source of stress was originally thought of as including both external events (such as bereavement) or an internal developmental process, which might require significant adaptation of mental functioning (such as maturational changes during adolescence). There was an implicit idea that adjustment to adversity or intra-psychic conflict could be either adaptive or maladaptive. If it was maladaptive, then personal dysfunction was to be seen as a psychiatric condition.",

      "title": "Clinical approaches for poststroke seizure: a review",
      "abstract": "Poststroke seizure is a potential complication of stroke, which is the most frequent acute symptomatic seizure in adults. Patients with stroke may present with an abnormal or aggressive behavior accompanied by altered mental status and symptoms, such as hemiparesis, dysarthria, and sensory deficits. Although stroke manifestations that mimic seizures are rare, diagnosing poststroke seizures can be challenging when accompanied with negative postictal symptoms. Differential diagnoses of poststroke seizures include movement disorders, syncope, and functional (nonepileptic) seizures, which may present with symptoms similar to seizures. Furthermore, it is important to determine whether poststroke seizures occur early or late. Seizures occurring within and after 7 d of stroke onset were classified as early and late seizures, respectively. Early seizures have the same clinical course as acute symptomatic seizures; they rarely recur or require long-term antiseizure medication. Conversely, late seizures are associated with a risk of recurrence similar to that of unprovoked seizures in a patient with a focal lesion, thereby requiring long-term administration of antiseizure medication. After diagnosis, concerns regarding treatment strategies, treatment duration, and administration of primary and secondary prophylaxis often arise. Antiseizure medication decisions for the initiation of short-term primary and long-term secondary seizure prophylaxis should be considered for patients with stroke. Antiseizure drugs such as lamotrigine, carbamazepine, lacosamide, levetiracetam, phenytoin, and valproate may be administered. Poststroke seizures should be diagnosed systematically through history with differential diagnosis; in addition, classifying them as early or late seizures can help to determine treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: A transient occurrence of signs and symptoms brought on by excessive abnormal neuronal or synchronous activity in the brain is known as an epileptic seizure. By way of onset, seizures can be classified as focal, generalized, unknown, or unclassifiable. An underlying structural abnormality can cause focal seizures in the brain. Among these, the temporal lobe is the most prevalent, but there may be alterations in the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes. The objective of this case report is to contribute to the knowledge of the multiple symptoms of patients with parietal lobe seizures. Case Report: The report is about parietal aura, diagnosed in the patient J.F.R., a 45-year-old male, and reported his first seizure in 2017. The patient said the increasing onset of the condition leads to significant body image disorders (the representation of the child during eye contact is similar to that of a monster). A limb or a body side may also appear heavier, more significant, absent, or separate from the rest of the body. The postictal period was slow, and full consciousness and correct body image emerged insidiously. Conclusion: In the evaluation, it is essential to value not only the main complaint but also the entire psychic context, cognitive function, and interpersonal and social relationships since these aspects can affect the quality of life of these patients and their integration into the social environment.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

      "abstract": "Abstract SCN1A is one of the most relevant epilepsy genes. In general, de novo severe mutations, such as truncating mutations, lead to a classic form of Dravet syndrome (DS), while missense mutations are associated with both DS and milder phenotypes within the GEFS+ spectrum, however, these phenotype‐genotype correlations are not entirely consistent. Case report . We report an 18‐year‐old woman with a history of recurrent febrile generalized tonic‐clonic seizures (GTCS) starting at age four months and afebrile asymmetric GTCS and episodes of arrest, suggestive of focal impaired awareness seizures, starting at nine months. Her psychomotor development was normal. Sequencing of SCN1A revealed a heterozygous de novo truncating mutation (c.5734C&gt;T, p.Arg1912X) in exon 26. Conclusion . Truncating mutations in SCN1A may be associated with milder phenotypes within the GEFS+ spectrum. Accordingly, SCN1A gene testing should be performed as part of the assessment for sporadic patients with mild phenotypes that fit within the GEFS+ spectrum, since the finding of a mutation has diagnostic, therapeutic and genetic counselling implications.",

      "title": "Convulsive Status Epilepticus in Infants and Children",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Two hundred and thirty‐nine cases of status epilepticus in children 0–15 years old have been studied. Generalized tonic‐clonic and unilateral clonic convulsions constituted the bulk of cases. Status is mostly observed in young infants since 37% of all cases occurred in the first year, 73% in the first 3 years and 85% before 5 years of age. In only 23% of the patients did brief convulsions precede the episode of status epilepticus. Conversely seizures were noticed after status in almost three quarters of patients followed for one year or more. One half of our cases were apparently due to organic brain damage, either acute or chronic, the remaining half had no recognized etiological factors. More than half of these cryptogenic cases were related to non‐specific febrile episodes. The prognosis of children's status epilepticus is grave, mental or neurological residua or both being present in at least 57% of our patients. Approximately one half of these children had had normal development prior to their bout of convulsions. Gross brain damage was the main cause of status below 6 months of age, whereas cryptogenic convulsions predominated during the second year. Most of these cases were associated with fever. It is suggested that status epilepticus is capable of causing brain damage whatever its cause and that many cryptogenic episodes of febrile status are but the most severe cases in the spectrum of febrile convulsions. RÉSUMÉ Deux cents trente‐neuf cas d'état de mal épileptique chez l'enfant de 0–15 ans ont étéétudiées. Les crises généralisées tonico‐cloniques et les crises cloniques unilatérales sont la majorité. L'état de mal est surtout fréquent chez l'enfant jeune, 37% des cas survenant dans la premiére année, 73% avant trois ans et 85% avant cinq ans. L'état de mal n'a été précédé de convulsions courtes que dans 23% des cas. A l'inverse des crises aprés l'état de mal ont ete notées chez prés de trois quarts des malades suivis un an ou plus. La moitié de nos cas semble due à une atteinte cérebrale organique, aigüe ou chronique, l'autre moitié de ces états n'ayant pas de cause reconnue. Plus de la moitié de ces états de mal cryptogenétiqués étaient en relation avec des infections banales n'intéressant pas primitivement le cerveau. Le pronostic de l'état de mal épileptique de l'enfant est grave, puisque des séquelles mentales ou neurologiques étaient présentes chez 57% de nos enfants. Chez à peu prés la moitié de ceux‐ci le développement neuro‐psychique avait été normal jusqu'à l'état de mal. Avant l'âge de 6 mois les lésions organiques sont la cause commune des états de mal alors que les formes idiopathiques sont prédominates dans la seconde anneé, le plus souvent en association avec de la fiévre. l'état de mal épileptique semble capable á lui seul de créer des lésions cérébrates définitives quelle que soit sa cause. Nombre d'états de mal fébriles ne seraient que la forme extrême des convulsions fébriles.",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorders are cyclical mood disorders with clinical features including distinct sustained periods of mood elevation. Briefer (4 days or more), mild episodes of mood elevation define bipolar II disorder; lengthier (7 days or more), more severe episodes (or those requiring hospitalisation), with or without psychotic features, define bipolar I disorder. Depressive periods are more common and lengthier than manic or hypomanic states, and are the main cause of disability. Bipolar depression may respond poorly to antidepressants and these medications may destabilise the illness. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be considered when a patient with depression is treatment resistant. Irritability is a common symptom in bipolar disorder, particularly during mixed states (during which patients have features of mood elevation and depression concurrently) or when there is rapid cycling of mood (more than four episodes of mood disorder per year). Alcohol misuse and use of illicit drugs may simulate mood changes in bipolar disorder. Accurate diagnosis and assessment of bipolar disorder is essential for clinical decision making and determining prognosis and treatments.",

      "abstract": "Résumé La découverte d'une chimiothérapie antidépressive a eu, sur le plan theorique, des conséquences qui n'étaient pas apparues avec celle des neuroleptiques et des tranquillisants. Le terme meme d'antidepresseur le souligne. Il s'agit en effet d'une classe de molécules qui agissent sur un ensemble de comportements définis et sur eux seuls. La question demeure ouverte de savoir comment les modifications neurophysiologiques obtenues par ces molecules agissent sur le comportement. Le fait que nous n'ayons pas une réponse précise à cette question explique sans doute la part importante de la resistance que Ton rencontre encore dans la prescription des antidepresseurs. On ne retrouve pas ce fait pour les neuroleptiques et les tranquillisants, bien que ces derniers présentent des effets secondaires plus nocifs (dyskinésie ou troubles mnésiques par exemple). Une première erreur consiste à confondre cause et mécanisme. Ce n'est pas parce que la chimiotherapie depressive agit sur la symptomatologie que le déficit qu'elle corrige est nécessairement, et encore moins uniquement, la cause de survenue de cet etat. En ce qui concerne les causes, nous devons conserver un point de vue pluraliste et uniciste à la fois en considerant qu'il s'agit d'une «maladie» pluri-factorielle. En termes de mécanisme, notre pensee doit demeurer resolument dualiste et reconnaftre un principe de parallélisme entre événements neurophysiologiques et événements comportementaux. La seconde erreur consiste à confondre liaison synaptique avec le concept classique de centre nerveux. Un exemple de cette confusion nous est peut-être donné par la recherche, jusqu'à présent stérile, de dépressions «noradrénergique» ou «sérotoninergique». Il est fort possible que les molécules dont nous disposons agissent sur des rélais dans un reseau de neurones qui sont impliqués dans les mécanismes comportementaux. La troisième erreur porte sur la manière dont nous traitons l'analyse comportementale de la dépression en se référant à une sémiologie qui a été construite à des fins tout-à-fait différentes (diagnostic d'une maladie et prévision de son évolution). Une analyse comportementale qui voudrait cerner de plus près l'action des molécules devrait renoncer à cette sémiologie et dégager des traits de comportement directement sensibles à l'action des medicaments. A la notion trop vague et trop globale de trouble de l'humeur, il serait sans doute utile de substituer celle de système ou plan d'action et de mecanisme d'interruption ou de ralentissement de l'exécution de ces plans.",

      "abstract": "The problems of diagnosis, pathogenesis, aetiology and successful treatment of the idiopathic schizophrenias is one of the most urgent and formidable ones which psychiatry has still to tackle. It is most urgent because of the large number of sufferers struck by the disease, made unfit for a successful life at an early age, and the distress imposed on them and their relatives. It is most formidable because our essential knowledge of the nature of this disease, or possibly group of diseases, is scanty and disorderly and opinions are conflicting and contradictory. This unsatisfactory state is made worse by the fact that there is quite an amount of disagreement on diagnosis, so that often the findings of different workers do not refer to comparable groups of patients (and conditions in which they are examined) which must add to the confusion, particularly when metabolic examinations are carried out. Too often “marginal psychoses“, and also not rarely, paranoid hallucinatory states with and without changes of the personality are called “schizophrenia”. The last-named states are not infrequently schizophrenoid reactions (or reactions of a schizoid person) to psychogenic causes or to potentially diagnosable physical disorders. On close clinical examination one would also find that the symptomatology of such cases is not that of idiopathic schizophrenia. In the “classical” schizophrenias of Kraepelin, Bleuler and Kleist, despite some discrepancies, the typical para-functions of feeling, willing, thinking and activity, usually accompanied by hallucinations, mainly auditory, and paranoid delusions are present and also a disturbance of the albumin/globulin ratio in C.S.F. and serum. In the absence of this mental and physical symptomatology the diagnosis of idiopathic schizophrenia should not be made (Fleischhacker et al. (7, 8)).",

      "abstract": "Without antidepressant therapy, episodes of clinical depression last from 2 months to several years, with an average of around 5 to 6 months. One-third of the patients recover within a year; probably one out of four untreated episodes may last more than 2 years. Depressive episodes occur, on the average, every 2 to 3 years. ECT and antidepressant drug therapy greatly reduce the duration of episodes and significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality of affective disorders. With modern treatment, during a 5-year follow-up, about one quarter of depressed patients had no recurrent episodes, more than half recovered in less than 2 or 3 months, and about one in seven patients developed chronic depression (episodes lasting longer than 2 years). Suicide attempts were made by one fifth of this group of patients, and 6% committed suicide. However, three-fourths of the patients were well three-fourths of the time. Age and culture seem to influence the course of depression. In addition to the classified clinical depressions, there is a considerable prevalence in the general population of depressive symptomatology and dysphoric states, apparently related to genetic factors, age, and stress. Little is known about the course and indications for treatment of these latter conditions, which should be the target for more systematic study and research in the ever widening fields of the phenomenology and therapy of depression.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic and recurrent disorder, a brain disorder that causes changes in a person’s mood, energy, and ability to function. Patients have alternate increased mood and activities (mania, hypomania, or “ups” period) and declining mood and activities (depressive or “downs” period) in their life. Symptoms of the manic episodes of bipolar disorder include sensitive feelings, lack of rest, and shot up self-esteem, while the depressive episodes bring loss of interest, more or less sleep than usual, anxiety, a feeling of worthlessness, and lack of concentration. Bipolar disorder is a severe mental disorder with a fairly high prevalence of 1%- 2% and is the 5th cause of disability in the world. Many factors have been considered to contribute to this disorder. While there is strong evidence that some genetic and environmental factors are associated with bipolar disorder, only a few can provide sufficient evidence to establish causality. This report discusses the case of a new manic episode of bipolar disorder that occurs in a woman aged 25 years old who works as a public figure, announcer, and entertainer. The patient has been hospitalized several times and received various pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy but still having difficulties in managing the ups and downs of her emotion. A lot of individual factors must be considered in managing patients with bipolar disorder.",

Depersonalization disorder (DPD) is classified by modern American psychiatry within the dissociative disorders, but its traumatic causes are more highly variable than those encountered in more severe dissociative disorders. Not only childhood trauma, but also later severe stress, frightening episodes of other mental illness, and even isolated drug use can precipitate the condition.

This implies a possible causal relationship, but definite diagnostic criteria for migraine-related vertigo are still lacking. Very recent attempts in this direction have shown that migraine may be the third leading cause of vertigo and that migraine-related vertigo may be effectively treated. A review of the literature on this topic, which includes some preliminary data of our own, demonstrates the difficulty in pinpointing migraine-associated vertigo as a clearly-defined entity. However, there is a measure of agreement on a few points: the spells of vertigo occur in patients who habitually suffer from motion sickness, and who have a history of migraine, either without or with aura; the delay between migraine and vertigo onset may be several years; migraine-related vertigo may be described as rotatory and/or as a feeling of unsteadiness, and single spells can occur without any other accompanying symptoms, however, when spells do occur in association with headache, they usually precede it. The vertigo duration may be shorter or longer than that of the migraine aura since it ranges from a few seconds to a continuous condition of unsteadiness.",

The clinical course over years is very variable. Milder cognitive dysfunctions in various conditions are very frequent in acute stage and in the further courses of the disease. Dementia is reported as a rare condition in MS. Rodriguez et al found in 1994 an incidence of 3,7 %. Over a period of 10 years we have investigated in our outpatient MS center the cognitive state of more than 400 MS patients for dementia according to the DSM IV classification and its correlation to MS. The main neuropsychological instrument was the Minimental Status Examination (MMSE). The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of our patients ranged from 0 (no signs, no disability) to 9 (bed ridden, helpless). In our data we classified 3 subtypes of dementia in MS (DMS). In DMS type 1 the cognitive decline is one of the main symptoms and develops early in the disease without marked motor symptoms. The DMS type 2 is associated with an malignant or chronic progressive course of MS itself. Therefore DMS type 2 developed in association with marked motor impairement later in the clinical course. In DMS type 1 and 2 a marked demyelination of the white matter and/or cortical involvement with brain atrophy, demonstrated by magnetic resonanz imaging is present. DMS type 3 is associated with older age with or without major motor disability. In these cases we found no clear correlation between the course and severity of MS and the dementia syndrome itself. In ptients with MS the development of dementia is very heterogenous. DMS type 1 and 2 are directly associated with the progression of the chronic autoimmune disease and the involvement of cortical and/or white matter structures. In DMS type 3 cases a comorbid condition with Alzheimer Dementia is discussed. It seems as DMS is not as rare as described in literature. Further epidemiologic studies are necessary to evaluate the incidence of DMS in a greater population",

      "abstract": "Summary Comorbidity commonly refers to the cooccurrence (o r dual diagnosis) of two disorders or syndromes in the same patient, regardless of whether the disorders are coincidentally or causally linked. Indeed, illnesses have been classified in discrete diagnostic categories although no sharp discontinuities in symptom distributions are observed across most mental disorders. Depression is a relatively common psychiatric comorbididy of most neurological disorders, with prevalence rates ranging between 20 and 50% among patients with stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and dementia. Furthermore, depression is an independent predictor of poor quality of life in these patients and has a negative impact on the response to treatment, course and recovery of neurological deficits. Comorbid depressive disorders in neurologic patients can be indistinguishable to the primary mood disorders and may mimic major depression, dysthymic, minor depressive, and bipolar disorders described in the DSMIV classification of mood disorders. In addition, the great overlap of medical and psychiatric symptoms in depression and neurologic disorders may lead to both falsepositiv e and falsenegative diagnoses of depression. Patient with comorbid condition have lower response rate and /or a longer time to response, greater reports of side effect early in treatment and greater likely hood of dropping out. In this review, we focus on comorbid disorder associated with depression.",

While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

      "title": "Cerebrospinal fluid leakage in a patient with depression: pre-existing depression may complicate the clinical picture of this complex syndrome",
      "abstract": "Orthostatic headache is a key symptom of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Other features may include neck pain, interscapular pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Various psychological or mental symptoms such as depression, forgetfulness, and a decreased power of concentration may also occur in this syndrome. When these symptoms are prominent or precede the onset of other symptoms, the clinical picture of this syndrome becomes more complicated, leading to misdiagnosis or long-term neglect. Of note, patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage who visit an otolaryngological or oto-neurological clinic usually have atypical manifestations. In the vast majority of our patients with this syndrome, the presenting symptom is dizziness, not headache. The presenting symptom of the 30-year-old female patient who is the subject of this report was also dizziness. The patient's initial symptom was a stomachache; however, medical therapy was ineffective, and endoscopic examination of the stomach revealed no abnormalities. The stomachache was diagnosed as resulting from psychological or mental causes. Other manifestations also indicated that the patient suffered from mental depression. Antidepressants and sleeping pills were prescribed, but no improvement was noted. Dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea, and loss of concentration occurred insidiously and worsened after the patient hit her occiput strongly against a wall during an attack of hyperventilation. The patient also complained of headache. The patient was referred to our clinic by a local otolaryngologist. At the time of the patient's initial visit, a slight unsteadiness was noted while the patient stood and walked, but other vestibular functions were normal. A neurological examination did not show any abnormalities. Psychological testing confirmed the presence of depression. The patient, presumably because of her depression, was dispirited and never discussed her symptoms voluntarily. However, a detailed history revealed that the patient had an orthostatic headache, paresthesia in both hands, blurred vision, and forgetfulness. Several episodes of falls at a pool-side occurring as early as during elementary school were also noted. The diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was confirmed by brain MRI and 111In-cisternography examinations. An epidural blood patch was performed three times. The patient recovered from her depression; although a mild headache and nausea persisted, all the patient's other symptoms, including dizziness and unsteadiness, improved dramatically. The patient returned to work.",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

      "title": "Recommendation for a definition of acute symptomatic seizure",
      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "abstract": "The concept of prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia is an old matter of debate. There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

      "title": "Depression and Suicide",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Most youth occasionally experience the blues, feel sad, or become irritable. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the possibility of a depressive disorder when a depressed or irritable mood is more than temporary, occurs in conjunction with other symptoms, or interferes with daily functioning. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is manifested by a depressed or irritable mood or diminished interest or pleasure that lasts for at least 2 weeks. This is accompanied by changes in cognitive and physical functioning. Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a less severe type of depression that involves chronic symptoms and lasts for at least 1 year. These specific types of depressive disorders are the focus of this article.Depressive disorders can be identified in children of all ages, but they become increasingly prevalent during adolescence. In fact, the peak ages of depressive symptom onset in lifespan studies are 15 to 19 years and 25 to 29 years. The sharpest rise in prevalence occurs among girls during adolescence and early adulthood. Approximately 2% of school-age children and 4% to 6% of adolescents struggle with MDD at any one point in time. Lifetime prevalence rates by late adolescence range between 20% and 25%.Prior to puberty, there is about a 1:1 gender ratio for depressive disorders. After puberty, this shifts to a 2:1 ratio of females to males, which continues throughout adulthood. A combination of hormonal and social changes during puberty may explain the differing rates of depression among males and females.Depression has a complex genetic and environmental basis. Adoption, twin, and family studies all point to the impact of genetic factors, which seem to establish a young person's biologic vulnerability for depression. The onset of a depressive episode, however, often is precipitated by difficult life events or stressful experiences such as a parental divorce, school change, or relationship breakup. Other environmental risk factors include maltreatment (sexual abuse, physical abuse, or neglect). The pathways to depression are complex and variable. Some depressive disorders are more biologic; others are more situational.The symptoms of MDD and DD, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), include changes in physical, cognitive, and emotional domains (Tables 1 and 2).In 1996, the World Health Organization ranked depression among the most disabling of all diseases in the world, leading all other disorders in \"years lived with disabilities.\" The reasons for this are apparent when one considers the course of depressive illness. Approximately 70% of youth who have MDD experience another depressive episode within 5 years, and youth who have depressive disorders have a fourfold risk of an adult depressive disorder. Approximately 50% of children and adolescents who have MDD can be expected to have adult recurrences. Early onset and recurrences also have been described as a cause of treatment-resistant depression in later life, leading to multiple episodes that last longer, become more severe, and become more difficult to treat. These tend to be associated with more hospitalizations, job absenteeism, and impaired work performance.Depressive disorders in youth are associated with impaired functioning in several areas of daily living. These include strained family and peer relationships, school attendance difficulties, and academic performance problems. Affected youth often experience suicidal thoughts and are at increased risk for attempted and completed suicide.Early-onset bipolar disorder (BD) often presents as depressive symptoms, which can make it difficult to distinguish between bipolar and unipolar depression. BD is characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression. The inflated self-esteem, excess energy, and poor judgment that characterize a manic phase often result in dangerous activity and substantial social problems. Rapid cycling and mixed symptom states occur in subtypes of BD. Approximately 20% to 40% of children who have MDD eventually develop BD. Some clues to the risk for developing a manic or hypomanic episode include psychosis, psychomotor retardation, or a family history of BD.Another potential diagnostic dilemma occurs when a child or adolescent is abusing alcohol or drugs. Youth are not always forthcoming about such abuse, which may be associated with declining school performance, withdrawal from usual social activities, sleep disturbance, and negative moods. Careful questioning of the youth and parent/guardian is necessary to identify a substance use disorder in youth presenting with depressive symptoms. It can be equally challenging to identify a depressive disorder in youth initially identified for services because of problems related to alcohol or substance abuse.Most children and adolescents who are depressed also have a history of some other psychiatric or alcohol/drug use disorder. For example, 25% to 75% of depressed youth have one or more anxiety disorders, such as separation anxiety disorder or social phobia. Disruptive behavior disorders, such as attention-deficit disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, are also common, and substance abuse or dependence characterizes a significant minority of youth who are depressed. A gender difference exists in patterns of comorbidity. Girls more commonly have comorbid anxiety conditions; boys are more likely to have comorbid conduct disorders or substance use disorders.Children and adolescents rarely seek professional treatment. Thus, parents, teachers, pediatricians, and others who have regular contact with youth play critical roles in recognizing youth who are depressed. Few youth use the word \"depressed\"; even fewer report to someone that they may be experiencing a clinical depression. Therefore, it is helpful to ask youth about experiences of feeling down, \"bad,\" miserable, bored, or irritated. Signs of clinical depression that often initially are visible to others include withdrawal from activities, decline in school performance, change in sleep patterns, and sadness or irritability.The United States Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended the use of two questions in screening for depression among adults: \"Over the past 2 weeks, have you ever felt down, depressed, or hopeless?\" and \"Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?\" The Task Force concluded that evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of routine screening of children and adolescents, but these two questions may help clinicians detect primary symptoms of depression. More comprehensive screening instruments and diagnostic tools or a referral to a mental health professional should be considered if indicated. The Reynolds Adolescent Depression Inventory (RADS) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) are screening tools used in some school and mental health clinics.Clinical interviews are the cornerstone of a comprehensive assessment and should include, at a minimum, interviews with the youth as well as the parent or guardian. In addition to gathering a complete history of presenting problems (onset, chronicity, severity, prior history of symptoms, and treatment), a full psychiatric interview is conducted to obtain information about possible comorbid conditions. For example, it is critical to ascertain whether psychotic features, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, or substance abuse problems are present. Information also is gathered about the youth's medical, developmental, social, and educational histories as well as the family psychiatric history.Important sources of information may include school academic and attendance records; teacher reports; and appropriate biomedical, psychological, or other test findings. Standardized self-report questionnaires may permit youths to answer questions about current symptoms without directly verbalizing the extent of their emotional distress to an adult. This approach sometimes can facilitate honest reporting of the number and severity of depressive symptoms. If noted in a self-report questionnaire, critical items always should be followed up with direct inquiry by the clinician (eg, if a youth reports suicidal ideation).The initial goals of treatment are to ensure the youth's safety and develop an effective therapeutic alliance with the youth and parents. This alliance will facilitate ongoing communication and continuation of care. Consultation with teachers and other caregivers also is important. A focus on patient and family education and a collaborative approach to treatment planning can enhance the youth's adherence to treatment recommendations.Psychoeducation is a key component of the treatment. Beyond this, perspectives on the first line of treatment vary. The choice of whether to begin with psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic interventions or a combination depends on depression severity and chronicity, prior history of depressive episodes, likelihood of adherence, previous response to treatment, patient and family motivation for treatment, and availability of resources. Because of the psychological, environmental, and social problems associated with depression and its treatment, pharmacotherapy usually is not sufficient as the sole treatment. Attention to parental mental health and family stress as well as to strategies for helping parents manage the youth's irritability, isolation, or other problems should be included in psychotherapeutic interventions. These systemic concerns affect treatment adherence and ultimate outcomes.Psychoeducation addresses the signs and symptoms of depression; the importance of psychotherapy and psychiatric medication; and common misconceptions about the illness, therapy, or medications. It also is helpful to address the impact that depression has on school, social, and family functioning and the ways in which parents and teachers may aid in recovery. Parent and family education may increase adherence and reduce self-blame. Education of parents can help them identify their own mood disorders and potential treatment needs as well. Education also can reduce blame for symptoms such as irritability and anhedonia that may affect others.Controlled studies have documented the short-term effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for depressed youth. Both generally are time-limited therapies that involve collaboration or guided discovery between the therapist and adolescent. CBT focuses on self-understanding of negative mood states and on the identification and modification of negative, distorted thought patterns. It also emphasizes problem-solving skills, communication skills, and the development of more adaptive behavior patterns. IPT strives to improve the youth's interpersonal functioning by improving self-understanding, problem-solving, communication, and coping in the realm of relationships. It focuses on a chosen interpersonal problem such as grief, a difficult role transition, an interpersonal conflict or role dispute, social skill deficits, or issues in step-parent families. Although randomized, controlled clinical trials have not been conducted for psychodynamic therapy with depressed youth, this approach may be useful. Family therapy is an important supplement to any of these approaches if difficulties in family communication and support are identified. Goals of family therapy may include improving family affective communication, increasing adaptive behaviors, and changing both interpersonal and family functioning.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the antidepressants of choice for youth who require pharmacotherapy (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 1998). The efficacy of the SSRI fluoxetine in reducing depressive symptom severity in children and adolescents has been demonstrated in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Paroxetine also has demonstrated efficacy compared with imipramine and placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison. Other antidepressant medications are not well studied. Dosing guidelines recommend starting with 10 mg fluoxetine and increasing to 20 mg. The maximum dose is 40 mg to 80 mg. When treating a child younger than 8 years of age, clinicians may want to start with 4 to 8 mg elixir of fluoxetine. However, the efficacy and safety data have been demonstrated only down to age 8 years. If there are problems with insomnia, appetite loss, or restlessness, paroxetine is a more sedating SSRI, and dosing guidelines are identical to those for fluoxetine. SSRIs should be discontinued if symptoms of mania appear. However, youth may benefit from treatment with an SSRI for an extended period before BD develops.An adequate trial of SSRIs is at least 4 to 6 weeks. If no or only minimal improvement is observed, a dose increase should be considered and medication continued for at least 4 to 6 additional weeks. If no improvement has been observed, alternative strategies should be considered, including a referral to a psychiatrist in cases of treatment-resistant depression. Additionally, if the pediatrician is not comfortable in the prescriber role, a psychiatric consultation or referral to a physician experienced in the use of medication is recommended. Frequent medication adjustments are ill-advised, and tapering of medications that have shorter half-lives (eg, paroxetine) is recommended. Obtaining serum levels rarely is necessary unless concerns arise about toxicity or compliance. Studies among adults suggest that the same doses used to treat MDD are efficacious for DD.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are not considered a first-line treatment for children and adolescents who are depressed, but they may be helpful in treating youth who have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, and narcolepsy as well as for augmentation purposes.In contrast to TCAs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs have a relatively safe adverse effects profile, are easily used (once daily), are suitable for long-term maintenance, and have a low lethality after overdose. Additional information on adverse effects, medication interactions, and the treatment of comorbid conditions is available in reviews of practice recommendations published by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.ECT can be a useful adjunct for individuals whose depression is severe or life-threatening, who have not responded to other treatments, who cannot take antidepressant medications, and who may have psychotic depression. The decision to use ECT must be made carefully and usually requires the recommendation of more than one psychiatrist as well as a substantial discussion with the child's parent or guardian.Unless there are significant adverse effects, medication should be continued for 6 to 12 months if it is believed to help in the remission of depressive symptoms. The pharmacotherapy should be monitored monthly during this continuation phase. Psychotherapy is helpful during this phase to bolster coping skills and to address antecedents, stressors, and interpersonal conflicts that may have contributed to the onset of depression. Medication adherence also may be improved by psychotherapy.Once the patient's symptoms have remitted for 6 to 12 months, the maintenance phase of treatment may last from 1 year to indefinitely. The goals are to facilitate healthy development and to prevent relapse or recurrence. These may be accomplished through monthly or quarterly visits, depending on the severity and chronicity of the present episode, frequency of previous episodes, comorbid disorders, the patient's motivation, and contextual factors (eg, support systems, family stress, and psychopathology).The presence of comorbid conditions often predicts a poorer response to psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatments. These conditions, such as anxiety, disruptive behavior, and substance use disorders, often persist after remission of the depressive symptoms and require targeted treatments. Because of time, cost, or the incompatibility of treatments, addressing all conditions simultaneously may be impossible. Hence, the clinician often must prioritize treatment goals and the sequence of interventions.A depressive disorder may be \"treatment-resistant\" because of an inadequate dosage or duration of medication trial, inadequate duration or \"fit\" with a particular psychotherapy, poor treatment adherence, complicating comorbidity, undetected BD, chronic or severe life events, misdiagnosis, or mistreatment. Psychopharmacologic strategies to address treatment-resistant depression should be applied systematically in conjunction with family education and support and include optimization, switching, augmentation, or combination. Consultation with a psychiatrist always is advised with treatment-resistant cases.If BD is present or is a possibility, a mood-stabilizing agent (eg, lithium carbonate, valproate, or carbamazepine) may be warranted, especially because antidepressants may induce mania in youths at risk for BD. Approximately 30% to 50% of adults experience modest antidepressant effects with mood stabilizers alone. Antidepressants may be useful adjuncts in such treatments. Psychotic depression may require a combination of antidepressants with antipsychotics or ECT. Neuroleptics should be tapered after psychotic symptoms remit due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotic medications may be preferred. However, the long-term effects of these medications have not been studied in youth.Suicide is the third leading cause of death among children and adolescents (National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, 2000). The suicide rate for ages 15 to 24 years is 11.1 per 100,000, which is much higher than the rate for youth between the ages of 5 and 14 years (0.8 per 100,000). The suicide rate for males in the 15- to 19-year age group is markedly higher than that for females (Table 3). Rates differ by racial and ethnic group. African-American youth have lower suicide rates than Caucasian youth, with the lowest adolescent suicide rate being that of African-American females. The highest suicide rate is that of Native American males.Although many youth who report suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide do not become suicide victims, these categories overlap substantially. For instance, having frequent thoughts of suicide is the best predictor of suicide attempts, and most youth who attempt suicide report a history of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, greater severity of reported suicidal thoughts increases the likelihood of a suicide attempt within the next year. Approximately 35% to 45% of adolescents who complete suicide have a positive history of suicide attempt. The prevalences of both self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are higher for adolescent females than for adolescent males (Table 3).Risk factors for completed suicide and suicidal behavior are similar in most respects. There are a few exceptions, however, such as the more specific relationship between availability of firearms and completed suicide. In this section, we review the primary risk factors for completed suicide (Table 4).A history of prior suicidal behavior is the strongest predictor of future suicidal behavior. Nonlethal suicidal gestures or self-inflicted harm, which sometimes are thought to be manipulative or attention-seeking, should not be taken lightly. Youth often can be poor judges of lethality, and what is believed to be a gesture actually may be accompanied by significant suicidal intent. It also may result in substantial physical harm or even suicide because of an error in knowledge or judgment (eg, potential lethality of acetaminophen overdose).Approximately 80% of youth who attempt suicide and 90% of youth suicide victims have histories of identifiable psychiatric or mental disorders. The most common types of psychopathology in these youth are depressive disorders, alcohol or substance abuse, conduct disorder or patterns of aggressive behavior, and anxiety disorders. Increased suicide risk is associated with conditions that often are refractory to treatment or present management problems. These include BD, a chronic depressive disorder comorbid with alcohol or substance abuse, and psychotic presentations.Depressive disorders are linked with increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides (Table 5). In fact, suicidal ideation and behavior are common and often unrelenting problems among youth who have depressive disorders. Eighty-five percent of depressed youth report significant suicidal ideation, and 32% of depressed youth report one or more suicide attempts prior to adulthood. Retrospective studies have found that about 50% of adolescent suicides involve the consumption of alcohol, which increases impulsivity, impaired judgment, and mood changes.Environmental or family stress, especially a history of neglect or physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, are considered significant risk factors for suicidal behavior. Interpersonal conflict and loss (eg, fights, break-ups, deaths) also are risk factors. Additionally, hopelessness, impulsivity, aggressive behavior, and agitation are psychological characteristics associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior.Gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents are at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Recent general population surveys indicate that approximately 42% of these youth experience suicidal ideation, and 28% have made one or more suicide attempts during the past year. Many of the risk factors in these youth are the same as those for heterosexual youth. Problems such as comorbid substance abuse and depression, however, are more common among youth who have a homosexual orientation. In addition, risk factors such as stigmatization and discrimination are specific to those who face negative attitudes within society.The risk for depression, anxiety, and suicide increases when a youth knows someone who commits suicide. In these situations, intervention aimed at promoting grief and mourning and decreasing guilt, trauma, and social isolation as well as providing psychoeducational counseling aimed at decreasing identification with the suicidal behavior are recommended. Media coverage of suicide may spark suicide contagion. Clinicians are encouraged to advise reporters whenever possible to reduce excessive coverage and to advise parents and educators to discourage exposure of youth to such coverage.Firearms are found more commonly in the homes of suicide victims than in the homes of other youth, including those of psychiatrically hospitalized suicidal youth. The importance of restricting suicidal youth's access to firearms is highlighted by documented associations between more restrictive gun control laws and decreases in suicide rates. Similarly, potentially lethal drugs (such as prescription or over-the-counter sedative drugs) either should be removed from the homes of potentially suicidal youth or monitored closely by parents and guardians.Evidence suggests that if asked directly, adolescents will reveal suicidal preoccupations and previous suicidal behavior. Direct questions should address whether children or adolescents wish they were not alive, if they ever have thought about or tried to hurt themselves intentionally, if they ever have thought about or tried to kill themselves, and if they have or had such a plan in mind. It is important to understand that asking an adolescent about suicidal thoughts or behaviors will not \"put such ideas into his or her head\" or increase the risk for suicidal behavior. Follow-up inquiry regarding the intensity, chronicity, specificity, and recency of such thoughts is advised. Standardized self-report questionnaires, such as the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, may permit the youth to answer without direct verbalization, which can facilitate honesty. If endorsed, critical items related to intent or planning and items suggesting significant suicidality (in terms of chronicity, severity, or frequency) always should be followed up with direct inquiry. Other sources of information include reports from parents, teachers, or others who may have heard suicidal statements or witnessed behaviors such as giving away prized possessions. As with the assessment of depressive disorders, a comprehensive evaluation that incorporates input from the youth and parent or guardian is essential.A psychiatric inpatient or partial hospitalization program may be necessary for patients found to be at elevated suicide risk. Hospital stays generally are brief and emphasize safety, stabilization, evaluation, and aftercare recommendations. Suicide attempts (or plans) that have significant lethality and that include efforts taken to avoid detection indicate serious intent as well as knowledge and planning and should be taken extremely seriously. Furthermore, attention to safety requires consideration of the child's home environment. Parents and caregivers should be advised to remove lethal agents, especially firearms and toxic medications, from the home. Self-injurious behaviors by young children should not be disregarded as accidental. For example, when a 6-year-old child ingests poisonous materials, it may not be accidental. Such behavior should be assessed carefully for associated mood or other disturbance.Verbal or written \"no suicide\" contracts are used in many settings. The patient is asked to agree not to attempt suicide. Furthermore, the patient is asked to agree to contact the clinician, parent, or other responsible adult if he or she feels a suicidal urge or experiences suicidal intent. Perspectives on these contracts have evolved over the past decade, with an increasing emphasis on using the contract as an assessment tool. The contract process may reveal current suicidal intent. It also provides information about the patient's ability to identify, and willingness to turn to, helpful adults. It is useful to review what positive coping steps the youth and parent would take in the event of a suicidal crisis. This offers an opportunity for problem-solving and can counter the tendency of some youth and families to minimize or deny the risk of suicidal behavior. It should be noted, however, that research does not support the conclusion that such contracts prevent suicide; they are not substitutes for comprehensive case management.When caring for a potentially suicidal youth, suicide risk factors, including suicidal thoughts, urges, and behaviors, are monitored at each session. Rules of thumb when working with suicidal youth include: 1) confirming next appointment times at each session, 2) following up on \"no-shows,\" and 3) providing information to the youth and parent or guardian about easily accessible 24-hour emergency services. Comprehensive case management includes psychoeducation and regular patient monitoring with guidelines for responding to crises/changes in functioning.The population of suicidal youth is heterogeneous in terms of primary psychiatric disorder(s), comorbid conditions, personality traits, the presence of complicating psychosocial issues, developmental level, and demographic characteristics. Therefore, the treatment should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of psychopathology and, more generally, suicide risk and protective factors.",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

      "title": "Auditory hallucinations, not necessarily a hallmark of psychotic disorder",
      "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations (AH) are often considered a sign of a psychotic disorder. This is promoted by the DSM-5 category of Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum And Other Psychotic Disorder (OSSSOPD), the diagnostic criteria for which are fulfilled with the sole presence of persistent AH, in the absence of any other psychotic symptoms. And yet, persistent AH are not synonymous with having a psychotic disorder, and should therefore not be uncritically treated as such. Many people who seek treatment for persistent AH have no other psychotic symptoms, have preserved reality-testing capacities, and will never develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Instead, hallucinations may be the result of many different causes, including borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hearing loss, sleep disorders or brain lesions, and they may even occur outside the context of any demonstrable pathology. In such cases, the usage of the DSM-5 diagnosis of OSSSOPD would be incorrect, and it may prompt unwarranted treatment with antipsychotic medication. We therefore argue that a DSM-5 diagnosis of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (or any other type of psychotic disorder) characterized by AH should require at least one more symptom listed under the A-criterion (i.e. delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior or negative symptoms). Adhering to these more stringent criteria may help to distinguish between individuals with persistent AH which are part of a psychotic disorder, for whom antipsychotic medication may be helpful, and individuals with AH in the absence of such a disorder who may benefit from other approaches (e.g. different pharmacological interventions, improving coping style, trauma-related therapy).",

The name given varies—“endogenous depression”, “manic-depressive psychosis/depressive type”, “melancholia” or “depressive illness”. The present generation of laymen (not to say some psychiatrists) use the word “depression” so freely in order to describe an unpleasant, unhappy mood, whether lasting or transient, that one may prefer the term melancholia, or at least “depressive illness”, to signify that condition which justifies the number 301.1. The adjective “endogenous” implies for many that environmental stress plays little or no part in the onset of the illness; we cannot accept that this is always so. The term “reactive” is used in several ways, generally to indicate that the state of unhappiness arises out of some external circumstance and that it would end when circumstances improved or the individual accepted the realities of practical life. The patients used in the present study were suffering from an illness of a kind which we believe may sometimes develop in the absence of severe environmental stress, while in others it may be clearly provoked by circumstances, but the illness, as it develops, may take on a form which becomes largely independent of the environmental circumstances and may continue even when the provoking factors are past; it has become an autonomous melancholia. It will be apparent that by autonomous melancholia we mean an illness shown by clinical experience to respond especially well to electroplexy.",

The 1970s witnessed an \"epidemic\" of dissociative disorder, particularly DID, which may have reflected enthusiasm for the diagnosis more than its actual prevalence. Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

      "title": "Is Multiple Sclerosis Patient Depressed, Stressed, or Both? How to Sort through Overlapping Symptoms and Provide Appropriate Treatment",
      "abstract": "Mrs. S, age 50, has had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) for approximately 10 years. She describes her mood as up and down and is referred by her neurologist for psychiatric assessment of mood swings and possible depression. Fatigue limits her ability to work full-time, perform household duties, socialize with friends and family, and enjoy mental or physical exercise. In addition, her 18-year-old daughter--an important source of psychological support--is planning to leave home. Mrs. S experienced depression 5 years ago during her divorce. She was prescribed paroxetine, 20 mg/d, and had a positive response. She took the medication for 6 months, then discontinued. One-half of MS patients experience major depression in their lifetimes, (1) and the suicide rate is approximately doubled in MS patients compared with the general population. (2) Depression in MS patients often has an atypical presentation, with irritability and anger being as prominent as sadness. (3) Not all emotional changes experienced by MS patients represent depressive disorders, however. When evaluating MS patients who are struggling with depression, you can help them by diagnosing comorbid mood disorders, determining suicide risk, and providing psychological support as they cope with the impact of their illness. MS disease course MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, characterized by: * inflammatory demyelination and gliosis * neuronal and axonal loss * a variety of presenting symptoms as different CNS regions are affected. Focal areas of demyelination followed by a reactive gliosis cause white matter lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Neurologic dysfunction can manifest as visual changes, spastic paresis, hypoesthesia and paresthesia, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. MS presentation also can include optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. MS symptoms often are intensified by heat exposure. After the initial episode, months or years may pass before additional neurologic symptoms appear. Based on its course, MS can be classified as: * relapsing-remitting, when the disease does not progress between attacks * secondary progressive, characterized by a gradually progressive course after an initial relapsing-remitting pattern * primary progressive, when patients experience gradual progressive disability from symptom onset (Table 1, page 80). CASE CONTINUED Progressing symptoms Mrs. S has had multiple MS presentations, including optic neuritis, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, and urinary incontinence. Recently, her MS symptoms have gradually progressed even in the absence of attacks, and her diagnosis has been revised to secondary progressive MS. During psychiatric evaluation, Mrs. S denies persistent changes in sleep or appetite. She describes fatigue that starts after physical exertion and increases as the day progresses. She denies feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation and does not have a history of inappropriate anger or irritability. Diagnosing depression in MS Normal emotional adjustment to MS can include reactions to loss of function or changes in social or occupational roles. Further, MS patients--similar to non-MS patients--experience life changes and transitions not related to the illness, such as divorce or a grown child moving away. Emotional responses to life stressors often are self-limited but may warrant an adjustment disorder diagnosis if they are associated with excessive distress or substantial impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning (Table 2, page 82). (4) Female MS patients and those who report high stress or a family history of affective disorder may be more likely to develop clinical depression. (5) Several studies have reported correlations between structural brain abnormalities and depression in MS. …",

      "title": "Childhood depression: early risk and resilience and introducing solids to infants",
      "abstract": "The carefree exuberance associated with young children can make the concept of childhood depression difficult to imagine. It is not surprising then that the existence of mood disorders in children has gained acceptance only in the last few decades. While debate continues regarding conceptualisations of childhood depression, evidence from over 20 years of research suggests that the major affective disorders often begin early in life. This article will outline current knowledge of childhood depression, including recent etiological evidence and implications. There is no formal diagnostic category specifically for childhood depression, with the mood disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) intended to apply to both adults and children. The key feature of clinical depression is a persistently depressed mood, or pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. However, for children and adolescents, this mood may be one of irritability rather than sadness. Associated symptoms include feelings of worthlessness, concentration problems, energy loss, and unusual changes in appetite or weight. These symptoms may occur in the context of major depressive disorder, which is marked by acute depressive episodes lasting at least two weeks, or in dysthymic disorder, in which such symptoms persist chronically for at least two years. Also grouped with the mood disorders is bipolar disorder, which is characterised by intermittent manic episodes. While this article focuses on unipolar depression, much of this information may apply to the less understood disorder of bipolar depression also. --------------------- For a number of years there had been some controversy over the appropriate timing of complementary foods to infants. It is with this background that the World Health Organisation (WHO) requested a review of the literature to establish the appropriateness of their recommendations. As a consequence, new guidelines were released in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The new guidelines recommend that complementary foods should be delayed until 6 months. It has been stressed in the literature review, however, that this is a population based recommendation and that infants must be managed individually so that appropriate interventions are provided (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004). By all standards of good nutrition, babies younger than four months who are exclusively breast-fed, or appropriately artificially fed, should not be given solids. The case for delaying complementary foods is based on the health of breast-fed infants and their mothers. The strongest evidence for the recommendation from the infants’ perspective is a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the absence of any growth deficit. For mothers, the benefit is in prolonged lactational amenorrhoea and greater post-partum weight loss (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004).",

      "title": "Medically Unexplained Symptoms and Health Anxieties: Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "\"Medically unexplained\" symptoms (MUS), also known as somatic symptom and related disorders in DSM-5, is a term used to describe physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by a known disease process. MUS are found across all specialties, can cause similar levels of disability to symptoms caused by disease, and may utilize high levels of healthcare resource due to frequent attendance and repeated investigation. These conditions include conversion disorder, illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis), somatic symptom disorder, and factitious disorder. While the term MUS recognizes the uncertainty around causation, it is less helpful clinically. The cornerstone of management is to assist the patient in finding an explanation that is helpful, enabling collaborative management of symptoms and ultimately allowing for a reduction in utilization of healthcare. We also describe cacosmia, a person's delusional belief that an unpleasant odour can be smelt, versus olfactory reference syndrome, where the person believes he/she emits the unpleasant odour. This can develop for a variety of medical, psychiatric, or psychological causes, but for some a cause may never be identified. We describe an approach to management for clinicians encountering patients with this distressing symptom.",

      "title": "Ruminative Coping with Depression",
      "abstract": "Most people have periods in which they become at least moderately depressed: they feel sad, they lose their motivation and interest in their usual activities, they slow down and are chronically fatigued, and so on. For most people, these periods last only a few days and their symptoms never become debilitating. For others, these periods last weeks or months, and their symptoms become worse with time. I suggest that the ways people initially try to regulate or cope with their symptoms of depression can affect the severity and duration of these symptoms. Specifically, people who have a ruminative style of responding to their initial symptoms of depression will have longer and more severe episodes of depressed mood than people who have more active, less ruminative response styles. A ruminative response style for depression is defined as the tendency to focus passively and repetitively on one's symptoms of depression and on the possible causes and consequences of those symptoms without taking action to relieve them. Ruminative responses to depression exacerbate and prolong periods of depression through at least three mechanisms. First, rumination enhances the negative effects of depressed mood on thinking, making depressive interpretations of events and negative memories more accessible and more likely to be used in ongoing deliberations about one's life. Second, rumination interferes with complex interpersonal problem-solving, in part because it enhances pessimistic, distorted thinking. Third, rumination inhibits people from engaging in everyday instrumental behaviors that could enhance their sense of control and lift their moods.",

Ovlivňuje spánek a stravovací návyky, způsob vlastní percepce stejně jako vnímání okolního světa. Deprese není známkou osobní slabosti nebo stavem, kterého se můžeme zbavit pouhým přáním nebo zapojením vůle. Lidé trpící depresí se nemohou jednoduše \"sebrat\" a uvolnit se. Je typické, že depresivní poruchy se vyskytují v různých formách. Soubory příznaků mohou přetrvávat po týdny, měsíce až roky, pokud nejsou léčeny. Odpovídající léčba na druhou stranu může pomoci většině populace trpící depresí. Máme k dispozici různé druhy antidepresiv, včetně těch nejnovějších, jako jsou - inhibitory zpětného vychytávání serotoninu (SSRIs) - stejně jako tricyklická antidepresiva a inhibitory monoamino-oxidázy (MAOIs). SSRI podobně jako další novější léky, ovlivňující přenašeče nervových vzruchů - např. dopamin nebo noradrenalin - mají obecně méně nežádoucích účinků než tricyklická antidepresiva. Vhodně zvolená psychoterapie v kombinaci s vhodným antidepresivem může podstatně přispět ke zlepšení kvality života lidí trpících depresí.",

      "abstract": "The problem of classifying mood disorders still lacks an acceptable solution. Interrater reliability studies have shown that this problem is more prevalent in mood disorders compared with other psychiatric conditions. Historically the problem originates from the distinction between Geisteskrankheiten and Gemütskrankheiten (mental and mood disorders) because the domain covered by the word mood has been progressively reduced. The fact that neurotic disorders are \"emotional disorders\" further complicates this field. The words anxiety and depression refer to a disorder, to a symptom, and to everyday feelings. A failure or difficulty in the distinction between these three meanings leads to nosological confusion. In recent years, the notion of a spectrum of mood disorders has gained acceptance. According to this, the diverse disorders are placed on a point that is more or less close to one of the extremes. Something similar occurs in the unipolar-bipolar distinction, in which the bipolar II or atypical and bipolar III occupy a central place on the spectrum. Cluster analysis and other mathematical techniques have helped to clarify the outlook, but there is a need for a biopsychosocial perspective and for a deeper understanding of the natural history of these disorders.",

Psychiatrists see such patients in liaison settings and clinics for those with psychotic and affective disorders. The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction. However, modern neuroimaging has allowed the study of nervous system structure and function. Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival). Psychiatric syndromes that have an impact on bodily awareness signal dysfunction within systems representing that body and its performance in time and space.",

      "title": "SCN3A- Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-ND) encompasses a spectrum of clinical severity associated with epilepsy and/or brain malformation. Affected individuals may have (a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (i.e., intractable seizures with global developmental delays associated with ongoing epileptiform EEG activity) with or without malformations of cortical development; or (b) malformations of cortical development with or without mild focal epilepsy. Some degree of early childhood developmental delay is seen in all affected individuals; the severity varies widely, ranging from isolated speech delay to severe global developmental delay. Infantile hypotonia is common but may be mild or absent in those without DEE. In those with DEE, seizure onset is typically in the first six to 12 months of life. A variety of seizure types have been described. Seizures remain intractable to multiple anti-seizure medications in approximately 50% of individuals with DEE without malformations of cortical development (MCD) and in 90% of individuals with DEE and MCD. Seizures may be absent or infrequent in those without DEE. Brain MRI findings range from normal to showing thinning or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, to various malformations of cortical development. Autonomic dysregulation, oromotor dysfunction leading to the need for gastrostomy tube placement, progressive microcephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment can also be seen in those with DEE. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN3A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Empiric treatment of seizures with standard anti-seizure medications (no specific anti-seizure medication has been shown to be more efficacious than another); feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement in those with dysphagia; standard treatment for developmental delay / intellectual disability, spasticity, hyperkinetic movements, autonomic dysfunction, and central visual impairment. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation for signs/symptoms of a movement disorder or autonomic dysfunction; monitor for new seizures or changes in seizures; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, behavioral issues, mobility and self-help skills; annual ophthalmology evaluation to assess for visual impairment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no evidence that specific anti-seizure medications can worsen seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. There is no evidence that sleep deprivation or fever exacerbate seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment. Pregnancy management: Use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy reduces the risk for mortality during pregnancy, but exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). The risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling SCN3A-ND is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of probands diagnosed with SCN3A-ND have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the SCN3A pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the SCN3A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "The initial conception of manic depressive illness by Kraepelin included short and mild depressive and hypomanic states in the nosologic category of affective illnesses. A longitudinal epidemiologic study in Switzerland (the Zurich Study) identified brief, but recurrent, episodes of depression with severity of symptoms, impairment, and distress equivalent to major depression. The concept of recurrent brief depression was further confirmed in recent community and general practice studies. The diagnostic criteria for recurrent brief depression require the presence of at least five of nine depressive symptoms analogous to the symptoms of major depression, yet a duration of less than 2 weeks (in general 1 to 3 days), a recurrence of at least 12 times a year, and the evidence of work impairment. The 1-year prevalence in the general population is about 5% and the lifetime prevalence 16%. Recurrent brief depression may develop into major depression and vice versa in about the same percentage of cases. It is associated with considerable suicidality and treatment-seeking and is comorbid with anxiety disorders. Patients with combined major and recurrent brief depression are more severely affected, have a higher suicide attempt rate, and have an increased frequency of treatment-seeking than patients with only one condition. Further studies are needed to establish appropriate treatment strategies.",

However, symptoms do not have a medical explanation but these are very real and not feigning the symptoms. It produces severe detrimental effects on patients’ daily functioning and social and occupational life like other mental illnesses. Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference. However, it was not shown by many patients, so it was removed from the diagnostic criteria of this illness. Dissociative conversion disorder is associated with many other mental health conditions like anxiety disorder and depression. Cognitive behavior therapy and psychoanalysis therapy are helpful in the treatment of this disorder.",

      "title": "When depression envelops frontotemporal dementia: The differential diagnostic frame through a case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is common in presenile population. The overlapping symptoms with other psychiatric disorders can lead to wrong/late diagnosis which cause delays/difficulties regarding case-management. Especially, long-standing and/or late-onset depression can descriptively envelop bvFTD (behavioral-variant) and leads to unnecessary treatments and increased distress. It’s important to implement a descriptive diagnostic algorithm which will help clinicians to distinguish the phenomenology of these disorders. Objectives This presentation aims to call attention of the clinicians/researchers to an elaborated effort concerning differential diagnosis of two common disorders with overlapping features through a case-study of a 59-year-old male patient. Methods One case from an inpatient unit of a psychiatric clinic in Lower Saxony, Germany will be reported. Results Case: The patient was referred to our acute-psychiatric-ward from the day-clinic-unit because of treatment-resistant, severe and long-lasting depressive symptoms. He was depressed, desperate, hopeless, listless and had suicidal thoughts. During the first days of treatment, symptoms like apathy, bad hygiene, weird eating-behavior, urinary incontinence, lack of empathy, language disorders and other behavioral symptoms were evident. Brain-MRI yielded frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Trail-Making-Test and Frontal-Assessment-Battery showed pronounced impairment of executive functions. Mini mental state examination and DemTect yielded light to moderate memory dysfunction. Diagnostic Criteria for Probable bvFTD (International-Consensus-Criteria) were fulfilled. Conclusions The diagnosis of bvFTD enabled a rapid assignment of a legal representative and relieved the long-lasting discomfort of the patient and his family that was caused by multiple unsuccessful treatment trials against depression. The differential diagnostic frame between bvFTD and depression will be discussed in view of the current literature. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, and verbal and nonverbal communication as well as limited and repetitive behaviours. Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

      "title": "Menstrual Psychosis with Premenstrual Onset: A case presentation",
      "abstract": "Introduction Menstrual psychosis has an acute onset and is characterised by confusion, stupor and mutism, delusions, hallucinations, or a manic syndrome lasting for a brief duration, with full recovery. These symptoms maintain periodicity in rhythm with the menstrual cycle. The symptoms may appear in the premenstrual phase or may begin with the onset of menstrual flow (catamenial psychoses). Usually, menstrual psychosis has a polymorphism of both psychotic and affective symptoms (Brockington I. Menstrual psychosis. World Psychiatry. 2005;4(1):9-17.). In this article we present a case of menstrual psychosis with premenstrual onset. Objectives A 26 years old, nulliparous single female with one mentally ill relative on her mother’s side (her grandmother) presented with an episodic illness characterized by mood swings, irrelevant speech, irritability, suspiciousness and thought disorder related to her menstrual cycles. She had earlier suffered prolonged attacks of mania, developed a recurrent episodic illness which returned every month for five years. Her menses began at 15. She presented with the history of a few episodes of manic illness starting five days before and ending suddenly with the onset of the menses. Methods On mental status evaluation during the index episode, the patient was agitated, had labile affect, grandiose and referential delusions and erotomania. A detailed physical examination, routine biochemistry, and gonadal hormonal assay were unremarkable. Results She was started on olanzapine 10 mg/day, lithium 1200 mg/day and low-dose clonazepam. Although the severity of the psychotic and affective symptoms gradually reduced during the future menstrual cycles, they did not completely resolve. Conclusions The pathophysiology of menstrual psychosis is not exactly understood, but it has been postulated that fluctuation of the sex hormones occurring during the menstrual cycle is responsible. Previous studies have reported the association of psychosis with estrogen withdrawal (Mahé V, Dumaine A. Oestrogen withdrawal associated psychoses. Acta Psychiatr Scand. 2001;104(5):323-331.). Treatment strategies for menstrual psychosis include the use of oral contraceptive pills for the regulation of hormones during the menstrual cycle, in our case patient did not want to use oral contraceptive pills.

      "title": "Syncope And Related Paroxysmal Spells",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal spells are non-epileptic, paroxysmal events that may mimic epileptic seizures but are not associated with rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons typical of seizures. They clinically manifest as a transient loss of consciousness, often occurring suddenly, with or without a prodrome. Paroxysmal spells can be caused by psychological disorders such as substance abuse and psychiatric disease or physiological events such as hypoglycemia, traumatic brain injury, and syncope. Psychological Conditions Data suggest that men with psychiatric disease have an increased incidence of syncope or paroxysmal events of unknown etiology. This data should lead clinicians to consider screening for psychiatric disorders in patients with transient loss of consciousness they cannot identify with a clear etiology.Among patients with a history of substance use disorder, 45% have been found to have unexplained syncope. This suggests that prior and current substance use is also associated with increased incidence of transient loss of consciousness of unknown etiology. Patients evaluated in the emergency department or even hospitalized with syncope of unknown etiology may benefit from toxicology screening and possible detoxification referral. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is defined as low blood sugar with associated symptoms. In patients without diabetes mellitus, this is usually manifested at glucose levels below 50 mg/dl. To diagnose hypoglycemia, symptoms and blood sugar must improve with exogenous glucose. Hypoglycemia can affect the central nervous system, leading to lightheadedness, nausea, flashes of light, focal neurological deficits, transient loss of consciousness, and seizure. It is, therefore, paramount that patients with any paroxysmal spell or syncope receive a fingerstick glucose. Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic brain injury is an intracranial impairment, often due to external forces. These forces may include blunt or penetrating trauma to the head, causing acceleration/deceleration injury to the cerebral cortex. Intracerebral bleeding, lacerations, and diffuse axonal injuries may result. Injuries, such as an epidural hematoma, may cause a brief state of loss of consciousness, with rapid return of, usually, altered consciousness. Other injuries, such as large subdural hematoma or diffuse axonal injury may cause worsening mentation and coma over hours to days. This is a result of increased intracranial pressure, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, and finally, neuronal ischemia. Diagnosis is by clinical history and CT imaging, although MRI may be more specific for secondary trauma. Management is to reduce intracranial pressure and edema. Syncope As most paroxysmal events are syncopal, the remainder of this discussion will focus primarily on syncope. Physiologically, syncope is a transient loss of consciousness as a result of cerebral hypoperfusion. As such, syncope varies from other etiologies of loss of consciousness in that it does not include head trauma or a post-ictal state. Syncope instead results in complete and rapid resolution of mental status. It may have myoclonic jerking, but no generalized tonic-clonic movement. Rather than a disease, syncope is a symptom of an underlying pathology ranging from benign to life-threatening. Patients are often divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, treatment, and management of these patients vary greatly. In the United States, hospitalization costs for syncope are estimated to be $5300 per admission and more than $2 billion annually. These costs are higher than those of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma combined. As extensive workups can be costly, time-consuming, and often unnecessary, a growing cadre of management tools has been devised to evaluate patients with syncope. These tools are tailored to determining the etiology of the syncopal event and treating dangerous, high-risk, syncope patients.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a serious disorder that often affects young people in their early twenties. The outcome is often poor, associated costs and burdens are extensive. Almost 15% of schizophrenics end up with frequent admission and require long-term residential care (1). Recently, the idea of early detection and intervention has been launched as a new and promising approach. The starting point for consideration regarding early intervention strategies is the observation that most patients who develop schizophrenia have had a period with non-specific, non-psychotic prodormal symptoms before the onset of psychosis (2,3). The prodormal period has been reported to last, on average, 1 – 2 years. Another finding across studies in that the period from onset of a manifest psychosis to onset of adequate treatment (duration of untreated psychosis DUP) is long. The mean duration of DUP is 1-2 years with a median of approximately 26 weeks. The majority of studies show a statistically significant correlation between long DUP and poor outcome (4,5), although others have not found the correlation (6,7).",

      "abstract": "Patients with anxiety and/or depressive disorders often experience sudden intense feelings of distressing emotions, including sadness, anxiety, loneliness, gloom and so on, without any apparent psychological reason. Tearfulness often precedes or accompanies such emotional outburst. In addition to these emotional symptoms, mild physiological symptoms similar to those seen in a panic attack, such as palpitations, dizziness, trembling and so on, may appear. Immediately after this emotional outburst, distressing trains of thought or images related to recent or past unpleasant events are experienced and ruminated on repeatedly. They are often manifested as flashbacks with or without visual images. Since these conditions are the bitterest experiences for most patients, they may cope with them in various ways such as deliberate self-harm. These patients generally have a more or less depressive mood. These conditions are considerably different from a panic attack, in that the emotional and cognitive storm dominates the physical one. The author named this condition as an Anxious-Depressive Attack (ADA). In this study, we present five cases of ADA and discuss their psychopathology and differential diagnoses. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report proposing the term ADA, which is a unique but common syndrome. Awareness regarding ADA may help improve understanding and treatment of the patient.",

      "title": "Neuropsychological triggering factors in musicians with focal dystonia",
      "abstract": "Focal dystonia is a\n neurological movement disorder which affects the fine motor control of a\n specific body location. In professional musicians, a limb or the embouchure\n involved in playing a musical instrument may be impacted. Focal dystonia in\n musicians (FDM) is characterised by a loss of\n voluntary motor control and can be a career-ending condition. The\n pathophysiology of focal dystonia, which remains incompletely understood, is\n mainly associated with dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits, with impaired\n inhibition and dysfunctions of sensorimotor pathways. FDM is triggered by various\n neuropsychological and environmental factors. However the existence of\n psycho-psychiatric comorbidities and their possible impact on and/or\n contribution to the manifestation of FDM remains under-investigated. Recent\n studies have revealed that motor function can be altered as a result of\n psychological or psychiatric conditions, suggesting common neurobiological\n networks. Studies conducted in other forms of focal dystonia have uncovered\n psychiatric or other psychological comorbidities such as obsessions, phobias,\n anxieties and depression, whereas a limited number of investigations with FDM\n patients have mainly indicated elevated levels of anxiety and perfectionism.\n The aim of the current thesis was to provide new insights into the\n psychopathology of focal dystonia and its possible consequences for motor\n performance in affected musicians. The investigation was divided into three\n different studies (chapters), each exploring a different aspect of the\n overall topic.\n The first chapter comprises\n a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the psychological profile of FDM\n patients based on standardised psycho-diagnostic\n instruments. Findings indicate that in comparison to healthy controls, half\n of the FDM patients exhibited elevated instances of psychological traits\n related to anxiety, perfectionism and dysfunctional stress-coping features.\n Furthermore, results suggest that these conditions pre-dated the onset of the\n disease and may have contributed as aggravating risk factors to the\n development of FDM. We suggest that the existence of FDM patients with and\n without psychopathology could reflect different mal-adaptive processes\n mediated via different circuits of the cortico-basal\n ganglia-thalamic loops.\n Most of the features in the\n FDM patients diagnosed with psychopathology were related to elevated levels\n of stress and anxiety. Therefore the second chapter focuses on the design of\n a complex experimental paradigm which examines physiological parameters\n (electro-myography [EMG] and fine motor\n performance) in relaxed and stressful conditions, in combination with\n objective assessments (electrocardiography [ECG], cortisol) of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\n (HPA) axis. Due to the fact that no similar paradigm has previously been\n implemented for patients with focal dystonia, a pilot study with a small\n number of patients was conducted. Findings suggest that the experimental\n design is feasible and serves its purpose.\n The final chapter\n encompasses a combined design derived from the first two chapters. Possible\n electrophysiological differences were examined i)\n between FDM patients and healthy controls, ii) among FDM patients before and\n after stress and iii) between\n patients with and without psychopathology. Findings indicate that FDM\n patients are characterised by increased sensitivity to psychosocial\n stressors, in comparison to healthy controls. The impact of stress is\n expressed as an increase in muscular co-contraction of the affected hand, which can be\n explained as a “natural” physiological response under stressful conditions. Finally,\n no motor outcome differences are found between patients with and without\n psychopathology, however results indicate that musicians with psychopathology\n had, on average, developed dystonia around a decade earlier than the\n remainder of the patients, emphasising the contribution of psycho-psychiatric\n conditions to the manifestation of dystonia. Summarising, the current\n thesis suggests the existence of psychopathology in about 50% of musicians\n with focal dystonia. FDM patients with and without psychopathology did not\n differ in their motor performance, however there is clear evidence that\n psychopathology can be an aggravating factor, which may accelerate or even\n trigger the manifestation of dystonia. The current thesis supports the\n concept that motor and psycho-psychiatric features share common\n neurobiological networks in patients with focal dystonia.",

On follow-up, all these phenomena either disappeared or markedly improved. Age and age of onset, but not pre-morbid intelligence or history of ECT, seemed to modulate the severity of the cognitive impairment. Presence of delusions predicted poor (but reversible) visuo-spatial function. Cognitive impairment accompanied by reversible soft neurological signs was more marked but patients thus affected surprisingly showed lower depressive scores; this was interpreted as representing a secondary, ‘organic’ form of affective disorder (i.e. a behavioural phenocopy of depression) characterised by a reduced capacity to experience depressive symptoms and by little improvement at follow-up.",

Personality, cognitive functions, α 2 and imidazoline binding, sensitivity to inducement of panic attacks, relative hypothyroidism, and some but not all serotonergic functions of women with dysphoric PMS differ from those with no PMS, and also differ during a non‐symptomatic phase of the cycle. It is suggested that premenstrual symptoms are an expression of vulnerability traits that might surface in response to a trigger. Such traits are probably diverse, and the nature of the symptoms might depend upon the underlying trait. It is postulated that some vulnerability traits to specific premenstrual syndromes might also be vulnerability traits to depression or anxiety in general.",

      "title": "Case report: Depression in an older patient with dysgeusia as the initial symptom",
      "abstract": "Introduction Depression is the most common mental illness among older adults, with substantial and persistent mood depression as the main clinical feature, which is unfavorable for improvement. The clinical manifestations can range from melancholy to grief or even numbness. Approximately one-third of older adult patients exhibit physical discomfort as the first symptom; dysgeusia as the first symptom, is very rare in clinical practice. Dysgeusia is a clinical symptom with no specific objective indicator; thus, the likelihood of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis is high. Case presentation In this study, a 60-year-old female housewife with elementary school as her highest level of education, presented to the outpatient department with dysgeusia, poor sleep, and poor mood persisting for &amp;gt;1 year, which aggravated 2 weeks before hospital visit. Psychiatric examination showed clear consciousness; the patient was cleanly and timely dressed and demonstrated self-care but had a worrisome expression. Using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (10 th edition), a diagnosis of a major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms was made. Following pharmacological and psychological treatment, the patient’s condition improved. The patient was compliant to treatment (10 mg/day of escitalopram), had a stable mood, good sleep, and no dysgeusia at &amp;gt;2 years of follow-up as an outpatient. She was able to do housework and take care of her children normally and did not complain about any other issues. Conclusion Physical discomfort is a very common complaint in older patients with depression. If persistent physical symptoms do not improve after repeated medical treatment, timely assessment of the patient’s mental state or psychiatric referral should be considered to diagnose geriatric depression. Timely pharmacological and psychological therapy are the preferred treatment for older adults.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

However, over a century’s worth of research has resulted in important pathophysiological and therapeutic findings. Though strongly heritable, schizophrenia is a highly polygenic illness involving very small effects across hundreds of common variants. Small reductions in brain volume have been repeatedly documented, as well as an increment in striatal dopaminergic release. The most reliably effective treatment involves agents that block dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the striatum, which though similarly efficacious, vary in terms of their side-effect profile. Only one drug, clozapine, has been found to be effective in schizophrenia patients who fail with other antipsychotic drugs. There is clearly a need for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this debilitating illness.",

      "abstract": "Key-words Disease name and synonyms Definition Abstract The syndrome of continuous spike and waves discharges during slow sleep (CSWSS) is a rare form of age-related epilepsy. Onset occurs between ages 3 and 7 years, and rarely before 2 years. In the absence of brain lesions, CSWSS syndrome occurs in normally developing children. Partial or generalized seizures are rare and occur while the child is falling asleep. Cognitive functions are subsequently altered and behavioural disorders are often seen. The initial neuropsychological deficits affecting a specific cognitive function such as language, gesture or constructive abilities, attention span or behaviour control are often wrongly attributed to psychological problems. The best known cognitive deficit is aphasia. Acquired epileptic aphasia, the Landau and Kleffner syndrome, has been named after the authors who described it in 1957. EEG anomalies are always present. During wakefulness, EEG recordings show focal paroxysmal spike and wave discharges. During slow sleep, spikes and waves become generalized and continuous, occupying over 85% of sleep. There are no concomitant motor seizures, but cognitive impairments progress. With antiepileptic drugs, the EEG becomes normal and neuropsychological status improves with antiepileptic drugs. Epileptic seizures always disappear with adolescence but neuropsychological sequelae may persist. There is no specific treatment with durable effects on the seizures and neuropsychological disorders. Management of CSWSS syndrome requires teams specialized in pediatric epilepsy and neuropsychology.",

      "title": "Etiology of Depression in Children.",
      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is experienced by a significant proportion of youth today, occurring at an earlier age than found in previous generations. Major Depressive Disorder can produce long-lasting detrimental effects on a child's life, which raises the question of etiology. Three areas were examined for evidence identifying specific determinants of Major Depressive Disorder in youth: biological factors, including studies on inherited characteristics; psychological factors, focusing on cognitive and affective activity; and environmental factors, such as stressful life events. The implications of the findings were then explored. ********** The term depression is often used to describe the temporary sadness, loneliness or blues that almost everyone feels from time to time. However, the DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised) defines Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a mental illness in which a person consistently experiences deep, unshakable sadness and diminished interest in all activities for a period of at least 2 weeks. Major Depressive Disorder dramatically impairs an individual's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life. Persons with MDD usually experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of committing suicide. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses. Although depression has long been a diagnosis made for adults, it has become increasingly prevalent in the youth of today. Mental health practitioners are seeing a marked increase in the number of youth who are experiencing depression at an earlier age than did previous generations (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Depressive symptoms and disorder are found in a significant proportion of young people, with long-lasting detrimental effects (Rice, Harold and Thapar, January, 2002). Major Depressive Disorder, having such a definitive impact on a child's life, raises the question of etiology. Three major areas will be explored as to the cause of depression in children, including biological factors, psychological factors and environmental factors. Some depressions seem to occur suddenly, even when life appears to be going very well. Others have an obvious external cause such as a relationship conflict, financial difficulty or some personal failure. Yet many individuals experiencing these problems do not become depressed. In an attempt to identify causal factors, it has been hypothesized that depression results from the interaction between a person's biological and psychological vulnerabilities and a stressful life event (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Biological Factors Depression has been found to run in families (Rice, Harold, Thapar, November, 2002). By studying twins, researchers have found evidence of a strong genetic influence in depression. Genetically identical twins raised in the same environment are three times more likely to both have major depressive disorder than are fraternal twins, who have only about half their genes in common. In addition, identical twins are five times more likely to have bipolar disorder in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating manic and depressive mood swings. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression can be inherited. Adoption studies have found that children of depression are vulnerable to depression even when raised by adoptive parents, offering more evidence of a genetic role in depression. A consensus that Major Depressive Disorder is both familial and inheritable is evident in the findings from both twin and family studies (Rice et al., January 2002). Family studies of early onset Major Depressive Disorder can be differentiated by the research methodology utilized (Scourfield, Rice, Thapar, Harold, Martin and McGuffin, 2003). Bottom-up studies evaluate the inheritability of Major Depressive Disorder by examining the child and working back through the child's ancestry. …",

The nosology of anxiety.Anxiety is phenomenologically defined as a state experienced as fear or tension dependent on whether psychic or somatic manifestations prevail. Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

The clinical manifestations were characterized by peculiar emotional disorders, polymorphous autonomic and vascular shifts. These states occurred in the majority of cases after some somatic diseases in conjunction with other physical or psychological stresses in individuals with anxiety traits and 'neurocirculatory asthenia'. The first phase of the disease was accompanied by anxiety, restlessness, autonomic and vascular paroxysms, anorexia, insomnia and disturbances of other physiological functions. Subsequently dysphoric mood, somatic concerns, pseudoneurotic and neurotic syndromes appeared. The outcome of the disorders was either with slow practical recovery or with a relatively stable personality change in the form of weakened volition, a reduction of energy, and a narrowing of the 'zone of comfort' due to the impairment of homeostatic functions. Often hypochondriasis could develop on the background of such features. Dysthymia is viewed as a special entity which must not be included either in the group of neuroses or in the group of typical organic brain syndromes, or in the group of endogenous psychoses.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n“An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and symptoms resulting from abnormal excessive synchronous neuronal activity of the brain.” The word seizure is of Greek origin, the root word being “seiein” which means “to shake”. “Epilepsy is a disease of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures.” It is also characterized by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of the\r\ncondition. Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the three:\r\n1. Two or more unprovoked seizures which occurs >24 h apart.\r\n2. One unprovoked seizure and a chance of occurrence of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years.\r\n3. Diagnosis of an electro clinical syndrome.\r\nEpilepsy is said to be resolved in those children who had an age specific epilepsy syndrome but now have crossed that age group or children who have been seizure-free for the past ten years, with no antiepileptics for the past five years.\r\nOBJECTIVE:\r\nThe aim of the study was to identify the pattern of abnormalities in MRI and EEG in developmentally normal children presenting with new onset seizures.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe study was a prospective observational study conducted in our hospital, Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children for a period of six months. The study included children who presented with new onset seizures in the age group 2 months to 12 years. Children with simple febrile seizures, acute CNS infection, trauma, toxin, metabolic seizures, chronic neurological illness were excluded. All the children underwent complete neurological examination, MRI brain and EEG.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe study included 100 children from 2months to 12 years. The results were statistically analyzed. The most common age group of children presenting new onset seizures was 6 to 12 years, mean age being 5.4 years. The commonest seizure type was generalized tonic clonic seizures. Eleven percent of the children presented with status epilepticus as the first episode of new onset seizures. MRI abnormalities were seen in 29% of the children most common finding being Ring enhancing lesion(65.5%). EEG abnormalities were seen in 38% of the children, commonest abnormality being generalized spikes(63.2%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nRing enhancing lesion is the most common abnormality in neuroimaging detected in children presenting with new onset seizures. Generalized epileptiform activity is the commonest EEG abnormality noted in children with new onset seizures.",

We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenic psychoses are a heterogeneous group of diseases that affect about 1% of the world’s population. The first symptoms of the disease usually manifest between ages 20 and 30. The diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and its subtypes are characterized in detail in ICD-10. Diagnosis is based primarily on the presence of productive symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations occurring for at least one month which cannot be explained in another way. Schizophrenia is a disease which largely affects social functioning of patients, such as occupational performance, family life, interpersonal relationships or housing situation. Apart from the sociological aspect, social lives of schizophrenia sufferers are significantly impoverished due to cognitive impairment associated with improper functioning of NMDA receptors. The study describes a case of a patient suffering from paranoid schizophrenia which sheds light on the social functioning of this group of patients.",

      "title": "PROBLEMS IN APPLICATION OF THE BASIC CRITERIA OF SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "Four cases were diagnosed as schizophrenic by careful observation and documentation. The patients had the following in common: 1. By all symptoms no schizophrenia was immediately apparent. It required time and attention to establish the diagnosis in all cases. But then it remained firmly established by the basic accepted criteria. 2. The patients were persons of good intelligence and had other assets as well. They tended to mobilize many mechanisms of defense as \"ego\" structure threatened to \"weaken\" further. These consisted both of additional neurotic defenses and some tendency toward \"acting-out,\" but no change was manifested in areas considered schizophrenic. Therefore, we are considering a category of individuals who belong to the group of schizophrenias according to legitimate definition, but apparently no more capable of disorganization, or display of blatant \"accessory\" symptoms, than the next person. In each of these instances, schizophrenic psychopathology comprised one part of the total picture, but did not thereby characterize the case. This concept differs from Hoch's \"pseudoneurotic schizophrenia\" (9) in that the latter describes an illness which is schizophrenic for all important clinical purposes: disorganization potential, therapeutic technique required, goals of therapy, and prognosis. By way of contrast, perhaps the best diagnostic approach to the above \"pseudoschizophrenic neurotic\" cases is the one or two paragraph description of psychopathology, with all factors evaluated on an individual basis.",

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms : characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both.\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience.\r\n\t\r\nHowever, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. \r\n\r\nThis chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Fatigue Among Female Academicians",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

Symptoms and complaints could be misinterpreted. Differential diagnostic assessments would be difficult either if the person has OCD or another diagnostic entity with OCD related symptoms. If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

There is no such thing as a non‐physical illness. Asking whether emotions cause diseases, or diseases cause emotions, leads to many difficulties and is unprofitable. It is far more useful to ask about stimulus‐response relationships. There are more kinds of specificity relations in psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine than are usually recognized, and the usual specificity statements in psychosomatic medicine are not concerned with I‐R or S‐R specificity. There are many problems in medicine which psychophysiology could help to solve.",

He was treated with antipsychotics, but had two bouts of malignant neuroleptic syndrome. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) gave some symptom relief and he continued on maintenance ECT for years with weekly intervals. Interruption of this treatment pattern rapidly increased symptom load. After seven years a lorazepam provocation test was performed as he had a new relapse after 3 weeks without ECT. In the ensuing hours his aggressiveness and nonsense speaking rapidly diminished.

      "title": "EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF A CHILD WITH FEBRILE SEIZURE",
      "abstract": "Febrile seizures (FS) are self-limiting and benign convulsions associated with fever, affecting children from 6 months to 5 years of age, most commonly in children between 12-18 months of age and last only few minutes. The international League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines FS as “a seizure in association with a febrile illness in the absence of a central nervous system infection or acute electrolyte imbalance in children older than a month of age without prior afebrile seizures”. There are simple and complex FS. A simple FS is a generalized clonic or tonic-clonic seizure, lasts less than 15 minutes and is not caused by brain infection or any other brain disease. While a complex FS is a focal or prolonged seizure and lasts more than 15 minutes. The child, either with a simple or complex FS is neurologically healthy. Evaluation of a child with febrile seizure includes medical history, family history of FS or epilepsy, physical examination, recent antibiotic therapy, recent immunization and day care attendance. Physical examination reveals normal neurological status as well as normal development of the child. In addition, signs for meningitis or encephalitis should be excluded during physical examination (e.g. stiff neck, altered consciousness). The prevalence of meningitis in children with FS is reported to be 1-2%. Management of a child with a febrile seizure includes maneuvers for cessation of seizure used as an acute phase treatment and evaluating the child for the etiology of the fever. Acute phase treatment includes appropriate lateral posturing with head extension, keeping airways open and administration of rectal diazepam. Intravenous diazepam is administrated while the child in the emergency room with a complex FS or febrile status epilepticus. When administration of intravenous diazepam is not possible, buccal midazolam is reported to be more useful than rectal diazepam. For a child with FS specific laboratory studies are not indicated except laboratory studies indicated by the underlying illness. For example in a child with diarrhea and vomiting laboratory studies for electrolytes are indicated and beneficial. Lumbar puncture (LP) is considered in children younger than 18 months because meningeal signs may be absent or subtle in this age group, while in children older than 18 months LP is considered only when there is a suspicion of meningitis. Brain MRI or CT is indicated in a child with FS if there is an increased intracranial pressure and history of trauma or a possible neurologic abnormality. Studies have not found electroencephalography (EEG) to be helpful in predicting the development of later afebrile seizure or epilepsy and that majority of these children have a normal EEG. For a child with a simple febrile seizure consultation with a neuropediatrician is rarely needed. In healthy children the consequences of FS are rare. As a first line therapy in a febrile child, antipyretics may be used as a symptomatic treatment after FS. However there is no reported evidence for prevention or decrease of FS when using antipyretics at the onset of fever. The use of neuroleptics or benzodiazepines after a simple FS currently is not recommended because of associated adverse effects, even though their use is reported to be effective in reducing the FS. However, if prevention of FS were essential oral diazepam would be used, because it is intermittent and has less adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Abstract—Anhedonia and, particularly, social anhedonia is an important psychiatric symptom playing a crucial role in the development of depression and schizophrenia. Social anhedonia in healthy people is related to changes in structure, activation, and connectivity of different regions in the prefrontal, temporal, parieto-temporal, and basal areas. In patients with schizophrenia the core fMRI correlates of social anhedonia are located in the temporal lobe. Studies in social anhedonia in depressions and other mental disorders are insufficient for drawing conclusions on this topic. Unlike physical anhedonia, social anhedonia demonstrates no specific link with the Nucleus accumbens volume or activation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Roughly one in five adults who meet criteria for long covid present with objective or subjective cognitive dysfunction or elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety lasting ≥12 weeks from an acute covid illness. These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.",

The differential diagnosis of OCD can be quite difficult since OCD symptomatology can occur as either primary or secondary phenomena. Comorbid depression or personality disorder is not uncommon in patients with primary OCD. Other comorbid conditions that occur with OCD can be divided into three major groups based on core features: (1) disorders of altered risk assessment; (2) incompleteness/habit-spectrum disorders; and (3) psychotic spectrum disorders. Such a categorization of core dimensions and comorbid conditions may prove useful in identifying distinct OCD subtypes that share underlying neurobiological or treatment response characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is considered one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood, characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. Even though a strict definition of this entity is constantly sought, ADHD is an often redefined and reconceptualized syndrome. Epidemiological studies show large differences in the incidence, pointing out that the effort of actual taxonomic systems to offer objective diagnostic criteria have not yielded substantial results. Bipolar Disorder (BD) with onset in childhood is distinguished from the adult form by the scarcity of affective symptoms. Very often, neither depressive mood, nor hypomanic euphoria are in the front line being covered by irritability with crises of violence. Children or adolescents have consecutive cycles, which include brief episodes of depressive, hypomanic, manic or mixed periods without free intervals. There was a delay in the recognition of this clinical picture. Τhe diagnostic criteria in the actual taxonomic systems are not separated from those of adults and according to some studies the disorder is under diagnosed mainly in European countries. The contemporary literature deals largely with the relationship ADHD - BD in young people because the two disorders share the same clinical picture with slight variations. Τhe differential diagnosis in favor of BD is mainly based on the presence of affective disorders in the family. The main questions raised are whether there is comorbidity, whether ADHD is overdiagnosed against BD or whether ADHD represents a prodromal manifestation of early onset BD. Children with comorbid ADHD and BD tend to express mostly a stimulant phenotype with a chronic course and have higher rates of antisocial conduct disorder. This particular phenotype suggests a symptomatic continuum between ADHD and early onset BD which is possibly responsible for the difficulties met in differential diagnosis and differences in the rates of comorbidity. It seems that the earlier the onset of BD more often it is combined with symptoms of ADHD which often precede mood disorders. The relationship between BD and ADHD is not just a nosological problem but has important implications for treatment. The confusion regarding diagnostic evaluation and the relationship of these two clinical entities is reflected in the proposed course of therapy particularly with regard tο pharmacotherapy. Τhe elevated rates of comorbidity between ADHD and BD observed in the USA, but not in other countries, are possibly due to the frequent use of stimulants.The dilemmas that arise for the diagnosis of ADHD, BD and their relationship refer to the difficulty of defining the limits of normal and abnormal in the mental health of children and adolescents and of the construction of a taxonomic system that respects the particularities of this developmental age spectrum. To achieve this goal, the search for objectivity in diagnostic criteria is not sufficient but one must also keep in mind psychodynamic factors that put children at the heart of their personal history.",

      "abstract": "Inherited metabolic disorders can cause onset of epilepsy in the first year of life. Epilepsy rarely dominates the clinical presentation, which is more frequently associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as mental retardation, hypotonia and/or dystonia, or vigilance disturbances. The pathogenesis of seizures is multifaceted; inherited metabolic disorder can affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory chemical mediators, eliminate an energetic substrate at the cerebral level, cause in utero brain malformation, or provoke acute brain lesions. Some clinical disorders that strongly suggest particular metabolic etiologies can be identified. For example, specific clinical signs and findings on electroencephalogram (EEG) are characteristic of pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and inherited metabolic disorders associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy are well defined. In most cases, however, epilepsy secondary to inherited metabolic disorders presents with polymorphic clinical and EEG features that are difficult to classify into precise epileptic syndromes. Common characteristics of these seizures include onset in the first months of life; usually partial, multifocal; simple partial motor semiology; successive appearance of tonic seizures, spasms, and massive myoclonus; and resistance to antiepilepsy drugs. Inherited metabolic disorders must be considered in patients presenting with epilepsy and progressive neurologic worsening.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: How to Alleviate Her Suffering; Accurate Diagnosis, Tailored Treatments Can Greatly Improve Women's Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Approximately 75% of women experience a premenstrual change in emotional or physical symptoms commonly referred to as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These symptoms--including increased irritability, tension, depressed mood, and somatic complaints such as breast tenderness and bloating--often are mild to moderate and cause minimal distress. (1) However, approximately 3% to 9% of women experience moderate to severe premenstrual mood symptoms that meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] PMDD includes depressed or labile mood, anxiety, irritability, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms that occur exclusively during the 2 weeks before menses and cause significant deterioration in daily functioning. Women with PMDD use general and mental health services more often than women without the condition. (3) They may experience impairment in marital and parental relationships as severe as that experienced by women with recurrent or chronic major depression. (2) PMDD often responds to treatment. Unfortunately, many women with PMDD do not seek treatment, and to 90% may go undiagnosed.4 In this article, we review the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PMDD. A complex disorder A distinguishing characteristic of PMDD is the timing of symptom onset. In women with PMDD, mood symptoms occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (ovulation until onset of menses) and resolve after menstruation onset. Women with PMDD report normal mood and functioning during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (first day of the menstrual cycle until ovulation). Although PMS and PMDD criteria share affective and somatic symptoms, more symptoms are required for a PMDD diagnosis, and symptoms often are more severe. (5) As defined in DSM-IV-TR (Table), (6) PMDD has a broader range of symptoms than PMS and includes symptoms not included in the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria for PMS, (7) such as impaired concentration, appetite, and sleep (hypersomnia or insomnia); and mood lability. PMDD symptoms must occur only during the 2 weeks preceding menses, although average symptoms last 6 days and severity usually peaks in the 2 days before menses. (1) The prevalence of subthreshold PMDD is fairly common; approximately 19% of women will meet some--but not all--DSM-IV-TR criteria for PMDD. (3) In a revision proposed for DSM-5, PMDD would be included as a mood disorder, which represents a significant change from DSM-IV-TR, where it is listed in the appendix as criteria. (8) In addition, in oral contraceptive users, a PMDD diagnosis should not be made unless the premenstrual symptoms are reported to be present and as severe when the woman is not taking the oral contraceptive. (8) DSM-IV-TR research criteria for PMDD A. In most menstrual cycles of the past year, [greater than or equal to] 5 of the following symptoms must be present for most of the time during the last week of the luteal phase, begin to remit within a few days after the onset of the follicular phase, and are absent in the week postmenses, with [greater than or equal to] 1 of the symptoms being either 1, 2, 3, or 4: 1. Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopeless, or self-deprecating thoughts 2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being keyed up or on edge 3. Marked affectivity lability 4.

According to recent clinical studies, the intensity of cognitive declines depends on a frequency and severity of seizures. However, presence of an epileptic focus does not always indicate an increase in cognitive impairments. An effect of a single convulsive seizure on cognitive functions at this stage is uncertain. According to some data, cognitive impairments after a single generalized seizures develop only in specific clinical syndromes, on the other hand, they are influenced by the emotional state of the subject. This problem remains relevant today. Further work is needed in this direction.В обзоре рассматриваются результаты исследований, посвященных когнитивным нарушениям (КН) после одного или нескольких судорожных приступов. Согласно полученным данным выраженность когнитивных изменений зависит от частоты и силы приступов. Но влияние однократного судорожного приступа на КФ точно не установлено: по данным одних исследователей, КН после однократного генерализованного судорожного приступа развиваются только при отдельных клинических синдромах, по другим - большое влияние оказывает эмоциональное состояние обследуемого. Подчеркивается, что наличие эпилептического очага не всегда говорит о нарастающем снижении когнитивных функций.

During one year we followed up every 3 months, 4 women, mean age 53.5 years admitted in Psychiatry Clinic. They all presented for depressive symptoms, started for about 4 years before, for which a series of antidepressants were used without any clinical improvement. Clinical, psychiatric and psychological evaluations were performed every 3 months, showing slowed verbal rhythm, difficulties in expressing themselves and finding right words, repetitive speech, lack of spontaneity and initiative. No perceptual disturbances or memory impairment were found. Systematically neurologic examination was normal except for bradykinesia and bradypsychia. MRI showed evidence of frontal and temporal involvement. According to DSM 5, criteria for probable neurocognitive frontotemporal disorder were fulfilled, as there were a prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production with relative sparing of learning and memory. Because of the nature of the symptoms and the fact that a patient is often 'too young' for dementia to be considered, FTD is often initially misdiagnosed. Especially when present in midlife, it can be a significant clinical challenge to distinguish it from primary psychiatric disorders like major depression, bipolar illness or even late-onset schizophrenia.

Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada.

It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Research has demonstrated considerable heterogeneity in the long-term course of schizophrenia. In the period preceding the onset of frank psychosis (onset), patients vary relative to the rapidity of onset, the presence or absence of asociality, and the presence or absence of semipsychotic symptoms. Following the onset of psychosis (middle course), patients may suffer from episodic or unremitting psychosis, and may or may not exhibit the deficit syndrome. In late adult life (late course), patients vary relative to the presence or absence of an improvement in psychosis and social capability. The usual approach to the study of putative course subtypes is to define a subtype by a number of features; they may include features of more than one epoch. In addition, the course of psychosis has not been distinguished from enduring personality impairments in these subtypes. Another approach to defining putative course subtypes would be based on dichotomizing patients according to the presence or absence of a particular feature of a single epoch. This second approach has important advantages: the availability of larger study populations and a diminished liability for confounding due to the correlates of features other than those under scrutiny.",

Curiously enough, compared with other functional symptomatology, somehow this disturbance has been neglected in literature until now. Urologists, surgeons, and internists have more difficulties than psychiatrists to find out that distinct emotional conflicts and especially unsatisfactory sexual adjustment might have contributed to the development of recurrent or chronic urinary retention which they vainly tried to explain by organic findings. Of course the fact that extensive medical evaluations or even surgical procedures revealed no abnormality except the stout urinary bladder never is suifficient to qualify for \"hysterical disease\". Every diagnosis has to be established on positive grounds. Hypothetic explanations of mysterious syndromes by supposing more \"microscopic\" and thus undetected morphological deficiencies and changes as the crucial cause of a disease never should become the protective trick by which a physician avoids confrontation with his patients' psychological problems.",

      "abstract": "Agitation is a nonspecific constellation of symptoms seen in a variety of psychiatric disorders, ranging from psychotic exacerbations in patients with schizophrenia to behavioral disturbances associated with organic factors. Its treatment must be individualized and based on the etiology of the psychomotor disturbance. Certain categories of drugs are broadly effective. Sedation and control of disruptive and dangerous behavior are the initial goals in stabilizing acutely agitated patients. Sedation is necessary during the lag period before antipsychotic and mood‐stabilizing drugs take effect. Barbiturates and chlorpromazine, initially given to control agitated behavior, are largely supplanted by higher‐potency antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and, recently, a combination of these two agents. Agitation is generally controlled within hours to days, whereas remission of affective or psychotic symptoms often requires weeks to months. Once remission is obtained, sedation is no longer desired and may be a barrier to optimal patient function and compliance. Thus, for long‐term treatment, strategies are used to minimize sedation, such as reducing dosages, changing administration to bedtime, or adding antidepressants or stimulants where appropriate.",

      "title": "Diurnal variation in anxiety and activity is influenced by chronotype and probable anxiety-related disorder status",
      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms vary moment-to-moment within a day. One factor that may influence these variations is chronotype. Evening chronotypes prefer to engage in activities (e.g., sleep, physical and social activity) later in the day, and evening chronotype is implicated in psychopathology, including anxiety-related disorders. However, it is unknown whether chronotype influences diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and whether these effects are amplified in individuals with a probable anxiety-related disorder. We examined the diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and daily activities in morning and evening chronotypes with and without probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a community sample of adults (N = 410). Evening chronotypes reported higher anxiety symptoms, particularly in the evening hours, and lower engagement in daily activities, predominantly in the morning hours. Evening chronotypes with probable GAD or OCD reported worse anxiety symptoms in the evening. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms and engagement in daily activities fluctuate considerably across the day, and these patterns differ depending on chronotype. Evening chronotypes have more anxiety symptoms in the evening, despite preferring this time of day. Personalized treatment approaches that consider chronotype and target certain times of day may be efficient in alleviating peaks in anxiety symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe, frequent, heterogeneous, longlasting and disabling chronic mental illness with high social impact, belonging to the group of chronic psychoses. There are several clinical forms and several possible evolutionary modes. Its etiopathogenesis is multifactorial (hereditary, biological, environmental, etc.) but no single cause has been demonstrated up till now. Schizophrenia is a group of disabling heterogeneous disorders that are generally severe, the course of which is chronic and disabling, and the prognosis is poor. Many retrospective studies have attempted to trace the premorbid history of adult subjects who developed schizophrenia. Their results appear to be extremely disparate, due in particular to the heterogeneity of the means of investigation used. In addition, in recent years, many studies have focused on prodromal symptoms occurring during the year preceding the first psychotic episode in late adolescence or early adulthood. Minor physical cranio-cerebral (at the level of the ears, the palate, the cranial perimeter), temporomandibular, dental and palatal abnormalities, dermatoglyphic disturbances or even subtle neurological signs have been frequently found in schizophrenic patients, in particular oral anomalies, more precisely the measurements of the teeth, their vestibulo-lingual and mesio-distal diameters. The objective of our article is to study the morphological abnormalities that exist in the patient with schizophrenia, and to demonstrate whether there is a link between the presence of these physical abnormalities and the occurrence of schizophrenia. This issue has been vaguely mentioned in the literature, but in the Moroccan context, it is a pilot study.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia: What determines its clinical features and course?",
      "abstract": "Despite more than a century of diagnosing and treating schizophrenia, it is still one of the leading health burdens in the world. Although much research effort in the past decades has led to great progress, there are still challenges in the understanding of this complex disorder.1 A large body of evidence implicates dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the manifestation of positive psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Presynaptic striatal dopamine synthesis and release are consistently reported to be elevated in schizophrenia.2 Recent studies have also shown that clinical high-risk subjects with subthreshold psychotic symptoms who later developed psychosis have an elevation in presynaptic striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, suggesting that dopaminergic dysfunction is already occurring in the prodrome.2 Given that high-risk individuals have a wide variety of clinical outcomes, and only a small proportion develop schizophrenia, this finding seems promising for the rational designing of early intervention strategies. Dopaminergic dysfunction, however, is unlikely to explain the full range of clinical features of schizophrenia. Disturbed glutamatergic function may underlie some clinical features other than psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. Hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are located on parvalbumin-positive GABA interneurons, is hypothesized to be causative of diverse features of schizophrenia including cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms, as reviewed by Uno and Coyle in this issue of the Journal.3 The challenge for the theories proposing a neurochemical basis, however, is to explain or to be reconciled with the longitudinal course of schizophrenia. Apart from the neurochemical alterations, schizophrenia is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder.4 Several structural changes in the brain considered to exist prior to onset have been reported in schizophrenia. Premorbid impairment in cognition is reported to manifest many years before the first psychotic episode. The neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that the effects of genetic predisposition and early environmental adverse events impair some of the crucial processes in early brain development. In addition to such initial insults, disturbance of brain maturational processes, including synaptic pruning and myelination during adolescence, might be critical in the manifestation of the first episode of psychosis. Gray matter loss reported to occur during psychosis onset may reflect such a disturbance.5 Although the precise mechanisms that cause aberrant brain maturation are unknown, an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons affected by oxidative stress is suggested, which could be a potential target for preventive intervention.6 Several clinical features of schizophrenia after onset, including relapse, development of treatment resistance, and deteriorating course to poor outcome, cannot be well captured by only the neurodevelopmental perspective. Progressive gray matter loss after onset in several brain regions suggests a neurodegenerative or neurotoxic mechanism, which could also be a potential target for therapeutic intervention to improve long-term outcome.5 In addition to this, the heterogeneity of pathophysiological mechanisms as well as the epiphenomena associated with several factors, including pharmacological treatment, should be fully taken into account for the further understanding of the determinants of the complex clinical features and course in schizophrenia.",

Freud elucidated the dynamic relationships in an impressive way; he described all that can be called neurotic in hysteria. But we know that hysteria encompasses more than various types of neurosis, and can also manifest itself in psychotic and psychopathic-like patterns of behaviour.",

Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

      "abstract": "La comorbilidad de trastornos de ansiedad y TUS es muy frecuente en el campo de la patologia. Ambos trastornos pueden ser primarios, el trastorno de ansiedad puede ser secundario (inducido) al consumo de drogas, o viceversa. El DSM-IV-TR1 describe 12 trastornos de ansiedad y 10 trastornos de ansiedad inducidos. Para poder realizar un adecuado diagnostico y diagnostico diferencial de los trastornos de ansiedad primarios o de los inducidos es necesario que transcurra un tiempo de abstinencia. El DSM-IV-TR senala la necesidad de que transcurran 4 semanas desde el ultimo consumo. Cuando el paciente toma benzodiacepinas de semivida corta o sustancias como la heroina, este tiempo es adecuado, pero cuando consume benzodiacepinas de semivida larga o metadona pueden ser necesarias varias semanas para poder realizar el diagnostico, lo cual no siempre es posible en la practica clinica. Por ello, para establecer un diagnostico diferencial adecuado es necesario realizar una historia clinica completa y valorar los posibles antecedentes personales o familiares de trastornos de ansiedad,indicadores de la existencia de una ansiedad primaria. El trastorno de ansiedad inducido por sustancias incluye aquellas entidades clinicas en las que la ansiedad es de caracter prominente, es decir, las crisis de angustia o las obsesiones o compulsiones predominan en el cuadro clinico. Ademas se debe demostrar que los sintomas aparecen durante la intoxicacion o tras el primer mes de abstinencia y/o que son secundarios al consumo de la sustancia. Los sintomas no deben aparecer en el transcurso de un delirium y deben provocar malestar clinicamente significativo o deterioro social, laboral o de otras areas importantes en la actividad. diagnosticos se cumplen en el curso de una intoxicacion, especificando entonces de inicio durante la intoxicacion, o si se cumplen durante o poco despues de la abstinencia, especificando en este caso de inicio durante la abstinencia. En el DSM-IV-TR no se acepta la existencia del trastorno de ansiedad inducido por nicotina ni por opiaceos. Etiopatogenia Se ha planteado que tanto el uso de sustancias como los trastornos de ansiedad pueden ser primarios o secundarios (inducidos) por lo que la relacion entre el consumo de sustancias y la ansiedad es controvertida. En muchos trabajos esta documentada la coexistencia de ambos pero en ocasiones es muy dificil dilucidar cual de ellos es el primario. Se han propuesto tres hipotesis explicativas sobre la relacion entre ambos trastornos3,4: 1. Los trastornos de ansiedad promueven el uso patologico de alcohol u otras sustancias. Algunos autores proponen que el alcohol u otras sustancias, por sus posibles efectos ansioliticos, pueden ser utilizados por los pacientes como autotratamiento de su ansiedad. En este sentido, tambien es posible que la ansiedad empeore o reactive un consumo de sustancias preexistente. Las evidencias de algunos estudios sugieren que la ansiedad social es un motivo importante para el consumo de alcohol5, ya que mejoraria las expectativas y la creencia de mayor autoeficacia en situaciones de ansiedad social.",

Therefore, as follows from the definition, dull schizophrenia - this is one of its forms, which does not manifest obvious progress and psychotic manifestations; the clinic appears to be mild personality disorders, derealization, depersonalization and asthenia. In this paper, a deep learning method for predicting disease impact in indolent schizophrenia applied to psychiatry has proposed. As a rule, it coincides with the first year of the disease or several years later. In this case, there are no pathologies; there may even be a decline in negative symptoms, its opposite development. But a new thrust may occur in the middle of the occupation age (45–55 years).",

      "title": "Epileptic Encephalopathies: A Brief Overview",
      "abstract": "Summary Epileptic encephalopathies are conditions in which neurologic deterioration is attributable entirely or partly to epileptic activity. It can be due to very frequent or severe seizures and/or to subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity. The former mainly consists of Dravet syndrome, in which patients have seizures from the middle of the first year of life and repeat episodes of severe febrile status epilepticus and migrating partial epilepsy in infancy, in which from the first trimester of life, partial seizures affect various areas of the cortex randomly and in a subcontinuous fashion. In Rasmussen syndrome, also, epileptic activity contributes at least partly to the neurologic deterioration. Subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity affects newborn infants with suppression bursts, thus consisting in either Ohtahara syndrome or neonatal myoclonic encephalopathy. In infants, it is either myoclonic epilepsy of nonprogressive encephalopathy or West syndrome. In school-age children, it consists of various types of generalized seizures combined with slow spike waves of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, and continuous spike waves in slow sleep combined with various motor or cognitive deficits including negative myoclonus, orofacial dyspraxia, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and frontal lobe syndrome. Treatment differs for all of these syndromes. It is important to avoid potential drug-induced worsening, and valproate is preferred when a definitive diagnosis is not reached in children and especially infants.",

That is, the hypnagogic state could be a kind of reluctance to sleep because sleeping means to meet the failing protective object. Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together. The way the container functions is related to the initial experiences of life with the mother.",

      "abstract": "Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migrana (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

      "title": "Back to the future: May Kleine‐Levin syndrome be an emerging psychiatric disorder?",
      "abstract": "Since the 20th century, atypical cases of recurrent hypersomnia are no longer related to mood disorders but are grouped together in the new Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS). Between neurology and psychiatry, the KLS symptoms include hypersomnia (up to 20 h of sleep/day), which may or may not be accompanied by disinhibition, derealisation, extreme apathy, cognitive dysfunction, childishness, anxiety, hallucinations, ideas of reference and delusions of grandeur. At the point of diagnosis, additional examinations (biology, imaging) are not diagnostic and are even less pathognomonic, just as is the case for psychiatric disorders. The indication for long-term treatment based on thymoregulatory depends on the intensity and frequency of the episodes. Today, the international literature insists on a dichotomy between BPD and very recent KLS despite the redundancy of such a distinction1 (Figure 1). KLS is commonly recognised as a neurological disease with inflammatory markers on functional imaging during episodes, between episodes and post-mortem. This has enabled it to be distinguished from mood disorders. However, recent studies on BPD have shown that it too. In addition, studies of both patients with BPD and their relatives have found that cognitive impairment and sleep problems appear 5–6 years before the first decompensation.2 At the same time, studies report that KLS leads to psychiatric decompensation in 20% of cases, with some cases being premorbid.3 Following the revision of the criteria for KLS,4 the number of cases being diagnosed has been increasing. Of all newly diagnosed cases of KLS, the diagnosis is in doubt in 20% of these cases, that is, in those involving latent or overt psychiatric comorbidities. These cases could, therefore, involve undiagnosed psychiatric pathologies. While there may be doubt regarding 20% of KLS cases, 80% are genuine. The question then arises as to which symptoms are useful in diagnosis: the old triad or the new paradigm of the 2000s? For Kleine, a neurologist, Levin, a psychiatrist, and their predecessors, it was a syndrome, not a disorder, that they were investigating. Ultimately, it was not a disorder that they were referring to, but rather an invitation for the scientific community to communicate with each other and a request for help with treatment. Recent studies have shown that the onset of BPD is associated with frustrating and unspecific symptoms, particularly anxiety, dissociative symptoms, and issues with sleeping. The mood-related component appears much later.5 One might wonder why the scientific community is resistant to the idea of classifying KLS as a mood disorder, given the heterogenic nature of bipolar spectrum disorder, which covers different types of BPD (Akiskal classification). In practice, these are young patients who receive a quick diagnosis. Where necessary, the psychiatric diagnosis made late in adulthood is appropriate in the event of extreme psychiatric decompensation. Whether for the 20% of KLS cases in which there is a cormorbid psychiatric pathology3 or 100% of cases of KLS if the existence of such a syndrome is disproved, there is already mental health care involving child psychiatry or psychiatric monitoring for these patients. The role of drug treatment appears to be very important. However, there are still some unanswered questions regarding its initiation early on in the course of the disease (especially in adolescents): Does it protect against severe decompensation? Does it guarantee better adherence to treatment? Kleine-Levin Syndrome could be an emerging psychiatric disorder in the spectrum of bipolar mood disorder with its major prevention challenges as the recent nosography is debatable and clinical cases question to provide better care.

In some cases, the content of the psychosis could be partly traced to earlier factors in the patient's lives. The clouded states were compared to alcoholic pathological intoxication. Three had chronic psychoses resembling schizophrenia. One other was considerably deteriorated. The rest were unclassified. The neuropathological processes underlying these conditions are unknown. The clouded states contribute to the study of psychopathology. Psychotherapy might be of some value. There is great need of research in this almost untouched field.",

      "abstract": "Partial remission from depression, with residual symptoms, is an important problem in depression. This paper reviews the frequency and features of this outcome, and its association with relapse. Residual symptoms occur in many depressed patients after acute treatment. They span the typical symptoms of depression, except those characteristic of severe disorders. Other persistent abnormalities include social dysfunction, dysfunctional attitudes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivity, shortened REM sleep latency, and mood lowering after tryptophan depletion. Associations of some of these with residual symptoms are not clear. There is growing evidence for similar residual symptoms in bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar depression. The most important consequence of residual symptoms is a much-increased risk of relapse, particularly in the first year. Residual symptoms are a strong indication for vigorous and longer than usual continuation of antidepressant treatment in order to prevent relapse. There is good evidence for the use of cognitive therapy as an adjunct.",

Patients report that these symptoms occur at almost every awakening; nearly all report abnormally ``deep'' and prolonged sleep as well. Approximately one third of all hypersomniacs seen suffered from sleep drunkenness. Of 58 cases of hypersomnia with sleep drunkenness examined, 52 were apparently idiopathic; six cases were possibly symptomatic of organic brain disturbance. A familial history of the disorder was found in 36% of the idiopathic cases. Electroencephalographic abnormalities were not remarkably prevalent or distinctive. Except for relatively high heart and respiratory in nocturnal polygraphic records, and except for extended sleep, no anomalies of sleep patterns were observed.",

      "abstract": "Despite precise definitions and exclusions for 19 syndromes of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE), under some circumstances it appears to be difficult to differentiate whether neuropsychiatric symptoms are caused by SLE or by other reasons such as primary mental disorders or substance-induced mood disorders, especially induced by glucocorticoids or antimalarials. We report the case of a male patient with SLE who presented with an exacerbation of bipolar disorder triggered by chloroquine. Firstly, when the patient was diagnosed with SLE, he underwent six months of therapy with chloroquine without any psychiatric symptoms. Later, the SLE returned and the patient was prescribed chloroquine again, without any mental illness. When the third exacerbation of SLE occurred, it coincided with a severe depressive episode with psychotic features that became aggravated for the first time after the administration of chloroquine. The chloroquine was subsequently replaced with hydroxychloroquine for the next six months without any behavioral problems, following which, the SLE and mood disorder were in remission. Later, a bipolar disorder relapse occurred, manifested by a manic episode, and in the following three months, despite psychiatric treatment, a manic episode with psychotic features developed four days after chloroquine was prescribed for arthritis. It was the second time that the mood disorder was exacerbated by chloroquine. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Our case points out that although chloroquine-induced psychosis is rare, patients presenting with behavioral changes need physicians’ attention in order to diagnose early and efficiently treat encountered mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "Con el nombre de demencia se denomina un sindrome complejo de naturaleza organica, adquirido, caracterizado por la presencia de un deterioro permanente de la memoria y otras funciones intelectuales, frecuentemente acompanado de otras manifestaciones psicopatologicas y alteraciones del comportamiento, que ocurre sin afectacion del nivel de conciencia ni depresion, y afecta al funcionamiento laboral y/o social del sujeto. La demencia es un sindrome clinico de etiologia multiple, por lo general de curso cronico y progresivo, pero no necesariamente irreversible. El principal factor de riesgo para las formas mas comunes de demencia, como la enfermedad de Alzheimer, es el envejecimiento. La demencia bien establecida afecta al 8% de las personas de edad igual o superior a 65 anos. Para una poblacion estimada en Espana de 7.576.309 de personas es este grupo de edad, podemos establecer una cifra de sujetos afectados que sobrepasa holgadamente el medio millon. Esta cifra puede doblarse si consideramos tambien las formas leves de sindrome demencial. Hasta el 75% de las personas mayores que residen en una institucion padecen alguna forma de deterioro cognitivo clinicamente significativo, un sindrome demencial en la mayoria de los casos. La tasa de conversion de pacientes con demencia leve o deterioro cognitivo significativo a casos confirmados de demencia se situa en el 10-12% anual. Las enfermedades que cursan con demencia imponen una sobrecarga intensa sobre los pacientes y sus cuidadores, lo que las transforma en uno de los problemas sociosanitarios mas acuciantes en nuestro pais. Las entidades que pueden dar lugar a una demencia son muy numerosas. Suelen considerarse 3 grandes grupos etiologicos: demencias degenerativas primarias (p. ej., enfermedad de Alzheimer); demencias secundarias (p. ej., demencia vascular) y demencias combinadas o de multiple etiologia (p. ej., demencia mixta o demencia tipo Alzheimer con enfermedad cerebrovascular asociada). La forma de demencia mas comun es la enfermedad de Alzheimer (60%), seguida de la demencia vascular (15-20%) y la demencia asociada a la enfermedad de Parkinson (10-15%). Estas formas mas frecuentes de demencia son irreversibles, pero hay que tener en cuenta que un 5-10% de las demencias son potencialmente reversibles, y entre ellas hay que destacar las asociadas al empleo de farmacos. El resto de las etiologias son infrecuentes y por lo tanto irrelevantes desde la practica en atencion primaria. Siguiendo el esquema propuesto por el Consenso Canadiense de Demencias, se exponen a continuacion las situaciones clinicas caracteristicas que suelen presentarse en atencion primaria, junto con una pauta de actuacion basada en los conocimientos actuales.",

Only one out of ten patients remains completely free of symptoms within an observational period of 3 to 7 years. The majority of patients suffer long-standing anxiety symptoms which do not significantly interfere with working performance or social relationships. Another ten percent of the patients are continuously impaired in everyday living by severe symptoms. Long duration and severe degree of symptoms at the initial assessment, as well as coexistent depression are associated with a poor outcome. There is evidence of an increased mortality in patients with panic disorder. Suicides are overrepresented among the causes of death. It is not clear whether this is due to the frequent comorbidity between panic disorder, major depression, and substance abuse.",

Here we present a case report in which even though the patient was hanged for more than five minutes until the formation of a ligature mark and exhibited cyanosis, unconsciousness and seizures, the outcome was favourable with prompt and early intervention.

Emotional disturbance and confusion are common at or soon after onset of seizures and are followed by dementia. Dysarthria and ataxia appear early, spasticity late. Pathologically polyglucosan inclusion bodies (Lafora body) are seen which are pathognomonic of the disease and are not seen in any other types of PMEs.

      "abstract": "The term transient global amnesia was first coined by Fisher and Adams in 1964 to describe a clinical syndrome characterised by the abrupt onset of severe amnesia usually accompanied by repetitive questioning, occurring in middle aged or elderly people, and lasting several hours.1 The aetiology of transient global amnesia has been a topic of debate, but in the past few years the situation has become considerably clearer with the emergence of the following diagnostic criteria: (1) attacks must be witnessed and information available from an observer who was present for most of the attack, (2) there must be clear cut anterograde amnesia during the attack, (3) clouding of consciousness and loss of personal identity must be absent and the cognitive impairment limited to amnesia, (4) there should be no accompanying focal neurological symptoms and functionally relevant focal signs, (5) epileptic features must be absent, (6) attacks must resolve within 24 hours, and (7) patients with recent head injury or known active epilepsy are excluded.2 3 Epidemiological studies which have applied these criteria have established that thromboembolic cerebrovascular disease plays no part in the causation of transient global amnesia, but the incidence of migraine in patients with transient global amnesia is greater than would be expected in the general population. A small minority of cases with unusually brief, and recurrent, attacks eventually manifest temporal lobe epilepsy.3 \n\nTurning to the neuropsychological aspects, much has been learned about the organisation and neural basis of human memory since the initial description of transient global amnesia. It is clear that memory is not a unitary function but consists of interactive systems.4 5 One broad distinction, which derives from experimental studies of patients with amnesia, is that between explicit and implicit memory; explicit memory refers to memory available to conscious access; implicit …",

Dementia refers to a collection of symptoms stemming from a broad array of etiologies precipitating in functionally impairing cognitive decline. While the presence of cognitive impairment is necessary and sufficient for a diagnosis of dementia, associated neuropsychiatric symptoms -known collectively as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, or BPSD - are prevalent and can significantly impact the prognosis and management of dementia. For this reason, DSM 5 requires clinicians to specify whether BPSD is present and to specify the degree of severity; for example, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia might be coded as “major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, with behavioral disturbances, severe.” BPSD includes emotional, perceptual, and behavioral disturbances that are similar to those seen in psychiatric disorders. It may be clinically useful to classify them into five domains: cognitive/perceptual (delusions, hallucinations), motor (e.g., pacing, wandering, repetitive movements, physical aggression), verbal (e.g., yelling, calling out, repetitive speech, verbal aggression), emotional (e.g., euphoria, depression, apathy, anxiety, irritability), and vegetative (disturbances in sleep and appetite).",

Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Dissociation is a ubiquitous clinical phenomenon. Dissociative disorders (DD) are primarily characterized by dissociation, and dissociative states are also a criterion for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociative reactions such as depersonalization/derealization and amnesia (e.g., gaps in awareness/memory) across diagnostic categories are believed to be affect contingent and theorized to serve affect regulation functions. What is not clear, however, is how self-reported affect and physiological reactivity unfold within dissociative episodes. To address this issue, the present project aims to investigate the hypothesis (1) whether self-reported distress (as indicated by arousal, e.g., feeling tense/agitated, and/or valence, e.g., feeling discontent/unwell) and physiological reactivity increase before dissociative episodes and (2) whether self-reported distress and physiological reactivity decrease during and after dissociative episodes in a transdiagnostic sample of patients with DD, BPD, and/or PTSD. Methods and analyses: We will use a smartphone application to assess affect and dissociation 12 times per day over the course of one week in everyday life. During this time, heart and respiratory rates will be remotely monitored. Afterwards, participants will report affect and dissociative states eight times in the laboratory before, during, and after the Trier Social Stress Test. During the laboratory task, we will continuously record heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory rate, as well as measure blood pressure and take salivary samples to determine cortisol levels. Our hypotheses will be tested using multilevel structural equation models. Power analyses determined a sample size of 85.",

Subtypes of schizophrenia (paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, residual) 1) Paranoid (best outcome)a) Presence of delusions (often persecutory) b) Frequent auditory hallucinations c) Onset of illness (late 20s or 30s) later than forother subtypes d) More likely to marry and have children2) Disorganized (formally called hebephrenic) a) Display disorganized, nonproductive behaviorsand demonstrate disorganized speech patterns b) Exhibit flat or inappropriate affect; grimacing iscommon c) Can act silly or childlike and burst out laughing forno reason d) Delusions and hallucinations are less organizedand fragmentary e) Earlier onset3) Catatonic (less commonly seen now than in previous years) a) According to DSM-IV-TR, must have at least twoof the following: i) Motoric immobility (catalepsy, stupor) ii) Excessive motor activityTable 6-1. DelusionsDelusion Definitioniii) Extreme negativism iv) Stereotypies, mannerisms, grimacing v) Echolalia, echopraxia4) Undifferentiated: these patients do not satisfy criteria for any other schizophrenia subtype5) Residual: according to DSM-IV-TR, these patients no longer have any major psychotic symptoms but still exhibit evidence of the illness, with negative symptoms or at least 2 other odd or eccentric behaviors or perceptual experiences6) Psychiatric terms and definitions are listed in Table 6-24. Course a. Chronic, usually early onset, poor long-term outcome,devastating illness 1) Prodromal phase: often prolonged period of socialwithdrawal, delayed developmental milestones, awkward in motor skills, loss of interest in self-care2) Active phase: psychotic symptoms appear, diagnosis is made more clear3) Residual phase: similar to prodomal phase b. Prognostic features and indicators1) Good outcome a) Acute onset, short duration, no previous psychi-atric history, no family history of schizophrenia b) Mood symptoms present, sensorium clouded c) No obsessive-compulsive disorder, noassaultiveness d) Premorbid functioning good, high socioeconomicclass e) Married, good psychosexual functioning f) Normal findings on neuroimaging2) Poor outcome a) Insidious onset, chronic duration, psychiatric his-tory present, positive family history of schizophreniab) Mood symptoms absent, sensorium clear c) Obsessive-compulsive disorder is present,assaultiveness is present d) Poor premorbid functioning, low socioeconomicclasse) Never married, poor psychosexual functioning f) Structural abnormalities present on neuroimaging5. Epidemiology a. Prevalence over lifetime is about 1.0% (no differencesworldwide) b. Average age at onset: men, 21 years (17-27 years);women, 27 years (17-37 years) c. Male (M):Female (F) equal frequency d. M>F in severity of illness, negative symptoms, suiciderisk e. F>M in mood comorbidity, better prognosis, bettersocial functioning f. Onset before age 10 and after age 45 are uncommon6. Etiology a. \"Two-hit\" or \"multiple-hit\" idea has strong support: thesubject may have genetic predisposition to develop schizophrenia but does not manifest it unless other factors are encountered (e.g., environmental stressors)b. GeneticsTable 6-2. Psychiatric Terms and DefinitionsSchizophrenia Prognostic Factors Better prognosis: female, older onset, married, good premorbid functioning, acute onset, mood symptoms present, clouded sensorium, short duration1) Siblings of schizophrenics: 10% develop schizophrenia 2) Children of parent with schizophrenia: 6% chance 3) Children of both parents with schizophrenia: 46%chance 4) Twins: nearly 50% chance for monozygotic and 17%chance for dizygotic twins 5) Multiple linkages (chromosomes 3p, 5q, 6p, 6q, 8p,10p, 13q, 15q, 18p, 22q) 6) Large trinucleotide repeats: CAG/CTG on chromo-somes 17 and 18 7. Neuroanatomical findings on imaginga. Most consistent finding is ventricular enlargement, especially third and lateral ventriclesb. Selective reduction in size of frontal lobe, basal ganglia, thalamus, and limbic regions, including the hippocampus and medial temporal lobec. Possible decrease in volume of neocortical and deep gray matterd. Sulcal widening, especially frontal and temporal areas e. Some studies indicate small but significant difference inbrain and intracranial volume f. Increased incidence of1) Cavum septum pellucidum 2) Partial callosal agenesis8. Functional neuroimaging a. Hypofrontality (frontal and prefrontal cortex): negativesymptoms and neurocognitive deficits b. Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies implicatefrontal cortex (orbital, dorsolateral, medial), anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, several temporal lobe subregions, and cerebellumc. PET studies: anatomic substrate for visual hallucinations in schizophrenia 1) Inferotemporal cortex is responsible for visual recogni-tion of objects and faces 2) Basal ganglia output (primarily substantia nigra parsreticulata) to inferotemporal cortex with relay in ventral anterior thalamic nucleus-influences visualprocessing and causes altered visual perception (hallucinations) as a result of increased dopaminergic activity in basal ganglia (may also be the mechanism of hallucinations in parkinsonian syndromes sensitive to dopaminergic agents [diffuse Lewy body disease more so than idiopathic Parkinson disease])9. Neuropathology a. Decreased cell density in the dorsomedial nucleus ofthalamus b. Displacement of interneurons in frontal lobe cortex c. Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11. Clinical management (see PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND OTHER TREATMENTS) a. Mainstay treatments: antipsychotics (D2 receptor block-ers [postsynaptic]) b. Treatment1) First line, atypicals (may improve neurocognitiveSchizophrenia Genetics Twin studies: nearly 50% monozygotic, 17% dizygoticChromosomes implicated: 3p, 5q, 6p, 6q, 8p, 10p, 13q, 15q, 18p, 22qTrinucleotide repeat (CAG/CTG) on chromosomes 17 & 18impairment in schizophrenia): risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprasole (Abilify)2) Second line: clozapine (Clozaril), is atypical, expensive, and needs monitoring because of the potential for severe agranulocytosis3) Typicals (may worsen neurocognitive functioning): chlorpromazine (Thorazine), thioridazine (Mellaril), perphenazine (Trilafron), loxapine (Loxitane), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), thiothixene (Navane), haloperidol (Haldol), fluphenazine (Prolixin)c. Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12. Psychosocial intervention strategies a. Emphasis on outpatient treatment b. Partial hospitalization, day treatments, outpatient care c. Family therapy reduces relapse rate d. Self-help organizations e. Cognitive therapy techniques: the goal is to remediatethe abnormal thought processes f. Social skills training: little effect on risk of relapse g. Psychosocial rehabilitation1) Restore the patient's ability to function in the community2) Appropriate/affordable housing, group homes 3) Vocational training 4) Assertive community treatmentB.

Cognitive decline may also result from hypopituitary dysfunction, undermanaged post-concussive symptoms, other mental health symptoms and disorders, medical conditions, and a genetic predisposition to neurodegeneration. Cognitive decline may be static or progressive. Any individual who presents with cognitive decline following a history of concussion should undergo a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation, and this should be coupled with a detailed medical and neurological exam to assess for all possible causes of impaired cognition. Neurodegeneration should not be assumed as a result of prior brain injury.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is a cognitive disorder. DSM-IV criteria for delirium must include both acute onset and fluctuating symptoms; disturbance of consciousness (including inattention); at least one of the following: disorganised thinking, disorientation, memory impairment or perceptual disturbance; and evidence of a putative causal medical condition. Traditionally, the course has been described as transient in which recovery is likely to be complete if the underlying aetiological factor is promptly corrected or is self-limited. The most common precipitating causes in elderly include sepsis, dehydration and drugs. Work-up for delirium is limited to septic screening, baseline investigations and imaging. Patients with delirium without focal signs and with either evidence for a medical aetiology of delirium or pre-diagnosed dementia are at a very low risk of having focal lesions in their contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. We are presenting an interesting case of delirium with urosepsis whose imaging revealed milliary brain tuberculomas on contrast-enhanced MRI.",

Their common characteristics are a late start, a chronic evolution, no cognitive impairment and no dissociation. Delusio- nal syndrome is often at the forefront with a predominant mechanism characterizing each disorder (interpretation for paranoid delusions, hallucination for psychose hallucinatoire chronique and imagination for paraphrenia). Although these disorders are less sensitive to the medication than schizophrenia, care is based on second generation antipsychotic treatment, in association with psychotherapy and social care. The aim of treatment is to alleviate delusion intensity to improve global functioning and to prevent violent incidents or suicide attempt.",

      "title": "Assessing the Outcomes in Patients With Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus: Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus Is Underdiagnosed, Potentially Overtreated, and Confounded by Comorbidity",
      "abstract": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is characterized by behavioral or cognitive change from baseline for at least 30 minutes with EEG evidence of seizures. Categorized into complex partial status epilepticus (with lateralized seizures), and generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus (bilateral diffuse synchronous seizures), there is debate regarding the diagnosis and morbidity of NCSE. Because EEG is needed for diagnosis, only a high index of suspicion leads to a request for the study, whereas EEG is often unavailable after hours or on weekends. Furthermore, the cognitive changes during NCSE are often incorrectly ascribed to a postictal state, intoxication, psychogenic or psychotic states, and mental retardation. Regarding categorization, present classifications address EEG features but fail to distinguish among depths of coma. Deeply comatose patients (with coma etiologies that themselves carry poor prognoses) are mixed with lightly obtunded patients with no morbidity, confusing the prognosis. Thus, a classification that subsumes depth of coma, and possibly etiology, is sorely warranted. Regarding treatment, comatose NCSE patients treated with benzodiazepines may worsen, whereas generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus patients may suffer iatrogenically from aggressive treatment (hypotension and respiratory depression) necessitating balancing the potential neurologic morbidity of NCSE against the possible morbidity of IV antiepileptic drugs. A high index of suspicion is needed to initiate EEG studies. Better stratification of level of consciousness will be needed to distinguish among morbidity due to underlying conditions, treatment, and the effects of status epilepticus, proper.",

      "abstract": "The chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (abbreviated CFIDS or CFS) is a disorder characterized by debilitating fatigue(over 6 months.), along with cognitive, musculoskeletal, and sleep abnormalities. The etiology of this illness is unlikely to be a single agent. Findings to date suggest that physiological and psychological factors work together to predispose and perpetuate the illness. Diagnosis is made difficult by the nonspecific clinical findings and no available diagnostic testing. With no known cause or cure for the chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome, treatment is based on relieving symptoms and improving the quality of life of affected patients. There is emerging evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome may be familial. In the future, studies will examine the extent to which genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of chronic fatigue syndrome. Most patients with CFS have psychiatric problems such as a generalized anxiety disorder, or major or minor depression, therefore, these mental health disorders may be correlated with the pathophysiology of the CFS. The treatment for CFS must be individualized, due to the heterogeneity of the CFS population. Also the treatment of CFS is built on a foundation of patient-physician relationship, respect and advocacy.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

Some of these problems may be due to existences of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a condition that affects over 10% of the population, or due to restless leg syndrome (RLS)/periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS), sleep-related involuntary leg movements often associated with an abnormal sensation in legs. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), parasomnia, and sleep problems associated with medical/psychiatric conditions are also common.

      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

The elevated mood or irritability is not accounted for by other disorders such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or Substance Use Disorder. If the child endorsed a Major Depressive Episode, the interviewer should inquire whether these symptoms occurred during the same 2-week period. If criteria are met for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. If the child’s symptoms do not meet the full criteria for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, NOS. These children may have typical bipolar symptoms but not the duration required by DSM. In addition, these children may be characterized by severe irritability, aggressiveness, agitation, and/or mood lability. There may also be more rapid cycling of mood.",

Su rasgo cardinal, la anhedonia, se vincula con alteraciones en la neurotransmisión dopaminérgica, desbalances energéticos neuronales y procesos neuroinflamatorios.Este trabajo describe la evolución natural del síndrome cuando no recibe diagnóstico ni intervención: desde la fase inicial con apatía fluctuante (0–6 meses), pasando por depresión persistente (6–18 meses), hasta la cronificación con deterioro funcional (2–3 años) y finalmente la progresión a cuadros de neurodegeneración y riesgo vital por suicidio (5–10 años). Con base en evidencia epidemiológica mexicana, se estima que entre 2–5% de la población adulta podría encajar en este fenotipo, aunque gran parte permanece infradiagnosticada y se autogestiona con conductas compensatorias de alto riesgo (consumo de azúcares, alcohol, nicotina).Se discuten los factores aceleradores (variabilidad glucémica, insomnio, sedentarismo, dieta proinflamatoria) y moduladores protectores (actividad física estructurada, dieta antiinflamatoria, higiene del sueño, reducción de azúcares), así como la urgencia de protocolos integrativos que permitan diferenciar esta condición de otros cuadros psiquiátricos tradicionales.El presente análisis busca aportar al reconocimiento clínico y científico de un síndrome que, de no ser visibilizado, condena a miles de pacientes a diagnósticos erróneos, tratamientos ineficaces y al deterioro progresivo de su salud física, mental y social.",

Insomnia can be transient, short-term, or chronic in its presentation. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related personal discomfort. Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation. Agrypnia excitata (AE) is the term which aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome, whose pathogenetic mechanism consists in an intralimbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from corticolimbic control.",

      "title": "Hallucinatory Palinopsia in COVID-19-Induced Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Visual perseveration or palinopsia is a nonspecific term that describes multiple types of visual symptoms characterized by persistence or recurrence of previously seen visual images, which are currently absent (1). Palinopsia has been associated with a wide variety of etiologies and mechanisms, such as drug-induced, idiopathic seizures, migraine, psychiatric conditions, metabolic alterations, head trauma, and structural lesions in the brain, mainly those affecting parietal and parieto-occipital connections (1). The high-resolution afterimages that are long-lasting, isochromatic, and unaltered by environmental conditioning and motion are typical of hallucinatory palinopsia, a category of palinopsia that represents a dysfunction in visual memory and is caused by posterior cortical lesions or seizures (1). By contrast, illusory palinopsia refers to afterimages that are unformed, indistinct, or of low resolution, and are affected by environmental conditioning. This type of palinopsia is due to a dysfunction in visual perception and is caused by migraines, prescription drugs, illicit drugs, or head trauma (1). Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurological disorder with various background risk factors, protean manifestations, and characteristic neuroimaging. Albeit several visual symptoms are commonly described in PRES (2), palinopsia is so far unheard of. Neuroimaging, in particular MRI, usually shows a distinctive parieto-occipital pattern with a symmetric distribution of changes reflecting vasogenic edema (2). The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been enlisted as a cause of PRES (3–5). We herein report one patient who presented with hallucinatory palinopsia, as a predominant phenomenon, during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced PRES. A 33-yer-old right-handed (laterality index of +100, as measured by Edinburgh's Handedness Inventory) woman with 10 years of formal education visited the outpatient department with mild fever, headache, and visual symptoms. Her medical history was unremarkable. On detailed enquiry, she claimed to visualize short, previously viewed, stereotyped actions, continuously replaying for several minutes for the past 2 days. She specifically complained of seeing television images with the news anchor appearing abruptly in the field of vision in over backdrop of wall and persisting for 5–15 minutes. After the neuro-ophthalmological examination at the outpatient department, she started complaining of perceiving a superimposition of the examiner's face shield and face mask on her visual field for next few hours. These incidents occurred minutes after the original visuals, with intact shape, architecture, color, and clarity, suggestive of hallucinatory palinopsia. There was no history of visual snow, micropsia, macropsia, teleopsia, akinetopsia, pelopsia, dysmetropsia, oscillopsia, phosphenes, and photopsias. She had no history of any drug intake, addictions, migraine, seizure disorders, diagnosed demyelinating disorder, and psychiatric ailments. She had no other cognitive deficits (i.e., neglect, visual perception, language, memory, and executive dysfunction). Other neurological and ophthalmological examination findings were noncontributory (See Supplemental Digital Content, Appendix 1, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A449). Complete hemogram, electrolytes, arterial blood gas analysis, vitamin B12, liver, renal, and thyroid function tests (including antithyroid peroxidase) were normal. She tested seronegative for HIV, hepatitis B and C. Her nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Brain MRI revealed hyperintense signal changes on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-weighted images, without diffusion restriction and signal blooming in susceptibility-weighted imaging, involving predominantly bilateral parieto-occipital regions and bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal gray–white interfaces, suggestive of PRES (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance venography, angiography, computed tomography scan of thorax, cerebrospinal fluid study, and conventional (1 hour) 1–70 Hz electroencephalography were normal. After 5 days of therapy with azithromycin 500 mg daily and dexamethasone 24 mg daily (in divided doses), all the symptoms disappeared, and steroid was put off after fast tapering before discharging her on 15th day.FIG. 1.: Brain MRI displaying multifocal hyperintense signal changes in bilateral occipital gray–white interface on axial T2-weighted (A) and coronal T2-weighted (B) images. Axial FLAIR-weighted images (C, D) showing hyperintense signal changes suggestive of vasogenic edema in bilateral occipital and frontal gray–white interface.The exact pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated PRES remains unclear. Among the possible mechanisms are (3–5): 1) cytokine storm-mediated disruption of blood–brain-barrier integrity; 2) interaction of viral spike protein S1 with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors, which are expressed abundantly on capillary endothelium, resulting in endothelial damage and increased permeability of blood–brain barrier; 3) SARS-CoV-2-mediated direct neurodegeneration and cerebral edema; and 4) SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia-associated hypoxemia, resulting in augmentation of systemic inflammatory response and deranged neuronal mitochondrial metabolism. All these mechanisms may destabilize autoregulation of cerebral circulation and may cause cerebral vasodilatation, neuronal swelling, and interstitial edema leading to PRES (2). The present case had features of hallucinatory palinopsia (i.e., categorical incorporation, scene preservation, and formed image preservation), indicative of a dysfunction in visual memory encoding, processing, or retrieval (1). Lesions involving both dominant and nondominant parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices can generate palinopsia (1). Because PRES has predilection toward the occipito-parietal regions of brain, disorders of higher visual function are common in this particular syndrome. However, palinopsia as a manifestation of PRES has never been reported before. PRES has been reported in COVID-19 (3–5). In our case, it could be caused by direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on brain parenchyma because our patient did not have traditional risk factors, particularly metabolic abnormalities, known to be associated with PRES, unlike the previous reports (Table 1). Although commonest presentation of COVID-19-induced PRES is altered mental status, visual symptoms may be found at presentation as earlier depicted by Kaya et al. (5).

Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

It underlines the fact that fewer patients present discrete, well-defined disorders, and that more and more patients (and their environment) appear to suffer from pervasive, multilevel disturbances which are not clearly compatible with either a neurotic or a psychotic personality organization (compare Kernberg<sup>2</sup>and Knight<sup>3</sup>).

Which symptoms are considered positive or negative varies across different authors, although there seems to be agreement on a core syndrome. The definition problems can be also found in the rating scales used for measuring positive and negative symptoms. The positive/negative distinction may represent different manifestations of a common underlying process. It also may suggest the existence of different pathophysiologies in schizophrenia. Since both positive and negative symptoms are frequent in schizophrenia, they are most likely not completely independent. The negative/positive syndrome is not sufficient to describe the dimensions of the complex phenomenology of schizophrenia. Among others, a depressive syndrome needs to be integrated. There is much controversy concerning the course of positive and negative symptoms over time. In subacute and chronic patients the negative syndrome seems to be more stable than the positive syndrome. The differentiation between primary and secondary negative symptoms seems to have great relevance to clinical and research aspects. This differentiation is an important factor in the interpretation of neuroleptic trials on negative symptoms. One way of differentiating between direct and indirect drug effects on negative symptoms is to use sophisticated statistical procedures, for example path analysis.",

      "title": "Psychiatric conditions",
      "abstract": "In reviewing psychiatric syndromes, some themes recur. This does not lead to a general theory of disorder, but to an analysis that has some general features. Set against a developmental background, disorder is viewed in relation to the tasks that must be achieved where multiple sets of mental rules are possible. These include the monitoring of internal and interpersonal rules, the maintenance of the individual's experience of continuity in the presence of multiple states of mind, and the capacity to understand the mental states and actions of others. Many of the overarching, metarepresentational functions could also be characterized as functions of the self, and these appear to be disrupted in conditions that are as widely different as schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. In schizophrenia the monitoring of the individual's own thoughts or actions may be impaired, whilst in borderline functioning the continuity of states of mind is undermined. If the sense of self is derived from the awareness of being the author of one's own actions or thoughts over time, then in these conditions it is undermined in different ways. Inasmuch as the coherence of the self is in turn central to action, disturbances of action are the result of these different forms of disruption of the self.In both condition, further contrasting factors may undermine action. In schizophrenia inefficient information processing may lead either to action based on incidental aspects of a situation, or to inaction based on information overload. In borderline personality disorder experiences in which action has been impossible may lead to action turned on itself, in self injury. However, in both, there may be elements that represent the attempt to preserve action in the face of such threats. In schizophrenia delusions and hallucinations may in part be compensatory mechanisms that reduce uncertainty, hence providing the basis for action. In borderline personality disorder the splitting of mental representations may similarly, by excluding elements that are incompatible with action, provide (partial) representations that provide the basis for action. Thus in both conditions elements of accurate representation are sacrificed, in order for action to continue.Conditions in which action is preserved may be contrasted with those, such as depression, where it is not. In either case a range of intentional and non-intentional origins may be envisaged. In situations of helplessness depression may be seen to be an appropriate and accurate representation that action is not possible. Depression seen in the absence of such threat may result from the intrusion of cognitive and emotional states that undermine action arising from a physical, non-intentional interruption of perceptions, thoughts, feelings, or actions. Equally depression may arise where mental representations that have been maintained inactive or out of consciousness are activated, and are incompatible with action.We conclude by revisiting our starting point. Mental entities, perceptions, feelings, thoughts, and wishes are genuinely causal and must provide sufficient certainty that the individual can act effectively. Throughout biology, intentional states of organisms, from the simplest cellular creatures to non-human primates, have provided the basis for action, and in general the certainty has been derived from the evolution of those intentional states over long periods of time. In this and the preceding chapters we have seen how, in the activities of the human mind there is an infinite elaboration of the potential inherent in all intentional processes in biology. This has introduced novelty, creativity, and flexibility, that are seen in the achievements of language, custom, technology, and culture. It has also increased the risks of uncertainty, confusion, and the undermining of action. These are reduced through an interplay between the sophisticated integrative capacities of the human brain and the continuities of human relationships, skills, beliefs, and social organizations. Disorder is found in the failure of intentional states to underpin action, where these are undermined by the external world, or where intentional states are distorted, contradictory or unintegrated, and where action is undermined or ineffective.",

      "abstract": "The long-term prognosis for epileptics vary from an entirely normal life to early death or complete incapacity. Studies to date have not provided clear answers on the long-term sequelae of epilepsy. This is because there are many epileptic syndromes with different outcomes. Most studies include a heterogeneous group of patients who may not be representative of all the epileptics in the community. The prognosis for permanent remission of seizure varies with the seizure type. In childhood epilepsies, overall there is at least 50% chance of permanent remission. The more seizures the patient has had before anticonvulsants were started, the more difficult it is to control the seizures, the poorer the prospects for remission. Other unfavourable signs include partial seizures, multiple seizure types, mental retardation, neurological deficits and underlying brain lesion. The effect of seizures on intellectual development is controversial. Actual regression in children with epilepsy is rare except where the seizures are caused by a progressive pathology. However, in a significant proportion of children, intellectual development slows down after the onset of seizures. This is more likely to occur in children with severe seizures, and those on multiple anticonvulsants and with frequent toxic levels. Children with epilepsy have an increased likelihood of developing behavioural, emotional and psychiatric problems. The underlying neurological dysfunction, anxiety about losing control of oneself at any time, reaction of parents, friends and teachers to the condition and side effects of anticonvulsants all contribute to the psychopathology. In conclusion, the long-term sequelae of epilepsy are multiple and serious. Some of the causal factors are known and preventable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Anticipation and recognition of DPHL should lead to earlier and more appropriate utilization of health care services.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A person with schizophrenia is more prone to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) when compared to the general population. Schizo-obsessive disorder is diagnosed when a person has schizophrenia with co-existing OCD or OCS. It is associated with depressive symptoms, no definitive diagnostic criteria and has poor response to polypharmacotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 23-year-old-man with no significant family history and symptoms suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia, was on intermittent treatment for 6 years. Since the past one year, he also had OCS and depressive symptoms – constantly checking himself if he passed stools, reduced appetite, disturbed sleep, suicidal thoughts. He has multiple hospital visits where they have changed the anti-psychotics and their dosage, given electro-convulsive therapy, but couldn’t be relieved of his symptoms. He was started on high dose antipsychotics of two different classes and serotonin agonists, but still did not improve. CONCLUSION: Schizo-obsessive disorder is a diagnostic difficulty to the clinician, reported to have poor prognosis. It significantly affects one’s general, social and occupational functioning. Research is required on its psychopathology, treatment protocols and its diagnostic criteria is yet to be established. Antidepressant, depression, insight, internalized stigma",

      "title": "Depression precedes development of dementia",
      "abstract": "Dementia and depression are common disorders in old age. Dementia typically manifests itself as a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognitive functions such as memory, orientation and speech. Dementia is common in old age and its frequency increases from 1% in 65 year olds up to 50% beyond 90 years. Depression usually appears as an episodic disease which extends in length from a few weeks up to many years. The core symptoms of depression include depressed mood, loss of interests and pleasure and loss of will to live. Cognitive disorders may accompany depression and are considered separate from dementia, and were thus named pseudo-dementia, presuming that these cognitive disorders will disappear as the depressed mood will remit. Lately it has been documented that depression may precede dementia, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. Although correlation never proves causation we discuss three possibilities, not mutually exclusive: 1) Certain brain changes may manifest first as depression and later as dementia. 2) Depression and dementia have partially overlapping biological causes. 3) Certain biological changes associated with depression may lead to dementia. Dementia and depression show many common biologic features such as white matter changes in the brain, reduction of hippocampus volume, changes in the serotonergic and noradrenalinergic systems and abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",

The patient has been seizure-free and asymptomatic for more than 5 years after resection. There were no operative complications. The patient’s behavior and neurocognitive performance have improved markedly, and he is now employed and does not require supervision. Also, there has been a pronounced reduction in the adverse effects of antiepileptic drug medication. Partial or localization-related epilepsy is the most common seizure disorder. Approximately 90% of the adult incident cases of epilepsy have recurrent and unprovoked partial seizures. An estimated 20% of patients with epilepsy have an intractable seizure disorder, that is, pharmacoresistant seizures that are physically and socially disabling. Coexisting comorbid conditions associated with an intractable seizure disorder often include cognitive impairment, behavioral problems, psychosocial isolation, and the inability to operate a motor vehicle or to be gainfully employed. Patients with medically refractory seizures may also require a supervised living situation or caregiver. A prognostic indicator for an unfavorable response to antiepileptic drug therapy is the identification of a structural lesion as the cause of the seizure disorder. Potential alternative forms of therapy for patients with intractable epilepsy include the use of newer antiepileptic drug medications, surgical treatment, and vagus nerve stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "title": "Djinnati Syndrome in Baluchistan: The Role of Traumatic and Abuse Experiences on Individual Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "is a culture-bound syndrome in Baluchestan, Iran. Experts believe that dissociation theory is more suitable for providing a psychopathological description of this syndrome in this region. In addition, they highlight need for investigating its pathology, particularly role of factors such as traumatic and abuse experiences during childhood.\r\n\r\nAccording to 4th edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (1), the essential feature of dissociative disorders is a disruption in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of environment. The disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic. According to DSM-IV-TR, dissociative disorders include: dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue and unspecified dissociative disorder. A dissociate disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) is a disorder that includes a dissociative symptom (i.e. disturbance in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of environment), that does not meet criteria for any specific dissociative disorder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, according to DSM a dissociative state may be defined as a dissociative trance disorder that includes a possession or trance state. Dissociative trance disorder is a single or episodic disturbance in state of consciousness, identity, or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures. Dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one’s control. Possession trance involves replacement of customary sense of personal identity or a new identity, attributed to influence of a spirit, power, deity, or other person, and is associated with stereotyped “involuntary” movements or amnesia. It is probably most prevalent dissociative disorder in Asia. The dissociative or trance disorder is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.\r\n\r\nMany culture-related syndromes, such as amok, bebainan, latah, pibloktoq, ataque de nervios and possession, shin-byung, enchantment, lack of spirit, Zar and djinnati (2, 3), are considered as dissociative disorders. Culture-bound syndromes include a set of psychological phenomena that are of interest to psychologists and psychiatrists. The eclectic nature of this syndrome has made it difficult to have a precise definition. Thus, deciding on a specific definition has been controversial. According to DSM, term culture-bound syndrome denotes a locality-specific pattern and repetition of an aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be illnesses, or at least afflictions that mostly have local names. Culture-bound syndromes do not one-by-one match routine diagnostic system diseases. Most of these syndromes were initially reported as an issue specific to a certain culture or a relevant set, or geographically-related to original culture (4).\r\n\r\nThe term Djinnati is a culture-bound syndrome, widely known by that name in Iranian and Pakistani Baluchestan (3, 5). Based on clinical observations, this syndrome was introduced by Bakhshani and Kianpoor in Baluchestan, Iran (6). A new study by Bakhshani et al. (3) on a rural population in Baluchestan showed total prevalence of 0.5% and 1.03% among rural population and women of that population, respectively. Common symptoms of this disorder include disruption in consciousness, memory and stereotyped behaviors such as laughing, crying, speaking incomprehensibly, which are attributed to a new identity known as Djinn. Attacks usually begin with pain, irritation and sometimes limb paralysis. In some groups, loss of speech and in some other cases, speaking in different languages and change in speaking rhythm and tone of voice have been reported. In addition, there was a partial and rarely complete amnesia during attack. Some patients were far beyond their physical strength. In addition, lack of control and harming themselves and others, during attack, have been reported; although, injuries were not serious. Sometimes during attack, The patients express some demands and possessor (Djinn) requests for satisfying these demands. Attacks usually last from 30 minutes to two hours (3). \r\n\r\nIt seems that traumatic and abuse experiences have an essential role in initiation and maintenance of dissociative disorders (7, 8). Results from Bakhshani et al. (3) study showed that 43% of patients experienced their first attack after a traumatic accident (5). After civil war of Mozambique, based on results of a study reported by Igreja et al. (9) on 941 subjects (255 males and 686 females), trauma and civil war resulted damages, which explain high prevalence of this disorder.\r\n\r\nCastillo (10), believes that biological and psychoanalytic perspectives are not capable of explaining spirit possession. Etiologically, he suggested that spirit possession, similar to multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a spontaneous trance reaction to severe and negative events in environment (particularly child abuse). On other hand, Naring and Nijenhuis observed a significant correlation between traumatic events and possession experiences (11). In addition, Naring and Nijenhuis (11) considered dissociative identity disorder to be a consequence of childhood abuse or other traumatic events, thus support post-trauma model. In this regard, a study by Pasquini et al. (12), showed a relationship between traumatic experience in childhood and development of dissociative disorders. Kaplan et al. (13) found that those with higher score in dissociative experience scale had been more sexually abused during their childhood. They have been reported to commit further suicide and aggressive behaviors (13).\r\n\r\nIn general, it can be concluded that traumatic experiences, specifically childhood maltreatment and abuse, are related to possession and dissociative experiences. Therefore, in future studies, it is required to investigate type of cultural beliefs abuse and other environmental factors with onset of clinical signs of Djinatti, and then develop and practice preventive and therapeutic approaches, based on findings.",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "title": "El déficit cognitivo en el síndrome de fatiga crónica: factores asociados y evolución",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION: El Sindrome de Fatiga Cronica (SFC) se define como una fatiga intensa, de etiologia desconocida que dura mas de 6 meses e interfiere en la calidad de vida del paciente. Ademas de estos sintomas, se acompana de problemas de memoria y concentracion, odinofagia, adenopatia cervical o axilar dolorosa, mialgia, cefalea de inicio reciente o de caracteristicas diferentes de la habitual, poliartralgia sin signos inflamatorios, sueno no reparador y malestar postesfuerzo que dura mas de 24 horas (Fukuda et al., 1994). Alrededor del 90% de los pacientes refiere deficits cognitivos (Jason et al., 1999), siendo una de las principales causas de discapacidad funcional. Los estudios neuropsicologicos constatan algunos de estos deficits, siendo los resultados mas consistentes en velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y atencion (Cockshell y Mathias, 2010; Michiels y Cluydts, 2001). La etiologia y el alcance del deficit continua siendo desconocida. Una de las hipotesis es la que sugiere que las alteraciones cognitivas son secundarias a los trastornos emocionales habitualmente presentes en el SFC. Tambien surge la preocupacion acerca de la evolucion del deficit sobre todo por parte del enfermo, a pesar de la escasa atencion recibida por parte de la comunidad cientifica. Finalmente, se desconoce el papel de otros factores, como la propia fatiga, en la disfuncion. Teniendo en cuenta estos datos, la presente tesis presenta como objetivos: determinar el perfil de afectacion cognitiva asociado al SFC, analizar la evolucion del deficit y los factores asociados. Para ello se realizaron tres articulos.\nMETODO: Se selecciono una muestra de mujeres con SFC mayores de 18 anos. Se realizo una entrevista clinica y una evaluacion neuropsicologica. Las puntuaciones directas fueron transformadas a puntuaciones T, tomando como referencia baremos poblacionales propios que habian sido validados previamente. Se considero deficit una puntuacion T<40.\nRESULTADOS: Mas del 50% de los pacientes presentaron deficits en atencion y funcionamiento psicomotor y el 40% en velocidad de procesamiento y funciones ejecutivas. No se observaron diferencias a nivel cognitivo entre los dos grupos de pacientes con SFC con y sin depresion. Cuando los pacientes se dividieron por grupos en funcion de la duracion de la enfermedad, tampoco hubo diferencias entre ellos en terminos de funcion cognitiva. El analisis de regresion mostro que la fatiga predijo los deficits de atencion y funcionamiento ejecutivo, y los factores emocionales predijeron el rendimiento en memoria verbal.\nCONCLUSIONES: En base a estos datos, se concluyo que los pacientes con SFC presentaron deficits cognitivos principalmente en atencion, velocidad de procesamiento, funcionamiento psicomotor y ejecutivo. La depresion no explico dichos deficits cognitivos. Tampoco se observo un empeoramiento de los deficits con la duracion de la enfermedad. Finalmente, dichos deficits parecen ser explicados por mecanismos fisiopatologicos de la propia enfermedad (fatiga). Una implicacion clinica de estos resultados, podria ser la implantacion de programas de rehabilitacion cognitiva para paliar el impacto de dichos deficits en la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable psychiatric condition, that is, associated with lifelong distress and impairment. There has been a long-standing interest in the early-life origins of BD, not least because as many as 50% of adults with BD report onset of their symptoms during childhood and adolescence.1 In this article, we present evidence on the assessment and treatment of BD and related conditions in young people. We also discuss the recent controversy about BD in children and adolescents that has led to the introduction of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.\n\n### Diagnostic features\n\nBD is characterised by episodes, that is, distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During these episodes, patients experience symptoms such as grandiosity, distractibility, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, an increase in activity, flight of ideas and psychomotor agitation. These episodes are required to last by at least 4 days to diagnose hypomania or at least 7 days to diagnose mania. The insistence on episodic mood changes is crucial and prevents clinicians from rating symptoms such as the chronic concentration problems of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as evidence for mania.2 Manic episodes are extremely rare in children and relatively rare in adolescents according to epidemiological studies in the UK and the USA.3\n\n### Acute treatment\n\nPharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute mania. Aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mania in children and adolescents, and olanzapine in approved only for adolescents. A comparative analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials in youth BD established that atypical antipsychotics have better efficacy and tolerability compared with anticonvulsants and lithium (effect size atypical antipsychotics 0.65, CI 0.53 to 0.78 vs …",

      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus is a common emergency condition in paediatric practice. Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy of Psychosis with Mixed Symptomatology",
      "abstract": "The introduction of potent physical and pharmacological therapies for psychotic conditions has increased the need for accurate diagnosis, not only in terms of assigning a patient to the diagnostic category but of assessing the various trends which may result in a very mixed symptomatology. Therapy, be it physical, pharmacological, or psychotherapeutic directed against one or the other of these components may frequently intensify other symptomatology. A suitable combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs plus the use of E.C.T. when indicated is necessary in the management of such cases. In the author's judgment this mixed symptomatology frequently results from the influence of personality trends and conflicts and particularly in these mixed states psychotherapeutic aid must also be included. In the words of Jules Masserman: “Even frankly psychotic behaviour patterns, whether depressive or schizoid, are not as sometimes inferred-merely shapeless fragments from a personality shattered by some hypothetical ‘mental disease’. On the contrary, the psychosis itself is an integrated syndrome which however socially deviant is adaptively operated at all levels from the physiologic to the most abstrusely symbolic.” (3)",

Compared with placebo, treatment with imipramine hydrochloride in a multiple crossover design using threeweek treatment periods led to improved performance on the memory task without either clinically apparent improvement in depression or significantly improved performance on the other tasks. These results may reflect the relative complexity of the memory task rather than a specific impairment of short-term memory, but the data do support the presence of cognitive dysfunction in depression, even in ambulatory patients without substantial impairments of attention or motor functioning. The results also indicate that antidepressant drugs can produce improvement in cognitive function, possibly as a forerunner of clinical improvement.",

Depression in three groups of medically ill, disabled patients (Parkinson's disease, right hemisphere stroke, and amputation) was studied. Mean depression severity and frequency of depression were equal for all groups. Severity of neurologic symptomatology was not consistently related to depression. Type of prosthesis, but not amputation type, was related to depression for amputees. Patterns of depression on discriminant analysis did differentiate the groups. A depression symptom conglomerate suggesting guilt and body image change with fatigue characterized the Parkinson patients most and the amputees least. A second depression conglomerate suggesting indecisiveness and thoughts of death or self-harm characterized amputees most and stroke patients least. Depression as an emotional response may not be a singular, specific feature of disabling illness in general, given uniformity of prevalence and severity, but differential etiology in specific instances should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Aim. We report the case of two young subjects who developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during a heavy use of ecstasy. After several months of discontinuation of the drug, major depression with psychotic features developed in one subject and a psychotic disorder in the other individual. No mental disorder preceded the use of ecstasy in any subject. Findings. A familial and personality vulnerability for mental disorder was revealed in one subject, but not in the other, and all physical, laboratory and cerebral NMR evaluations showed normal results in both patients. Remission of OCD and depressive episode or psychotic disorder was achieved after treatment with a serotoninergic medication associated with an antipsychotic. Conclusions. The heavy long-term use of ecstasy may induce an alteration in the brain balance between serotonin and dopamine, which might constitute a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the onset of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and psychotic symptoms. The heavy use of ecstasy probably interacted with a vulnerability to psychiatric disorder in one subject, whereas we cannot exclude that an “ecstasy disorder” ex novo affected the other individual.",

      "abstract": "Dissociated states represent pathological conditions where psychological trauma may emerge in a variety of forms such as psychic dissociative symptoms (hallucinations, derealization etc.) or on the other hand as somatoform symptoms (paroxysms, loss of motor control, involuntary movements etc.). Recent findings suggest that neurophysiological level of dissociative phenomena may be linked to the same neurophysiological principles that emerge in multi-stable perception of ambiguous stimuli likely caused by competing interpretations with mutual exclusivity. At this time there is evidence that temporal lobe seizure activity can produce dissociative syndrome and from these findings may be inferred that temporal lobe epileptic activity existing independently of neurological focal may share common neurobiological mechanism with dissociative symptoms. This conceptualization of dissociative phenomena is also in accordance with findings that originate from the study of the relationship between epilepsy and mental illness. The relationship was for the first time described in Meduna's concept of antagonism between epilepsy and psychosis and from the study of forced normalization introduced by Landolt in 1950s. The findings reported similar pathological conditions as in dissociative states when psychopathological symptoms and paroxysms may represent two different forms of the pathological process. Following the concept of forced normalization Tellenbach in 1965 introduced the term alternative psychosis implicating that stopping seizures does not mean vanishing or inactivity of the pathological state and that the epilepsy is still active subcortically and supplies energy for psychopathological symptoms. In the present review chaos in brain neural networks as a possible explanation of the relationship between dissociation and epileptic activity has been suggested that represents testable hypothesis for future research.",

      "title": "Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term “psychotic disorders” refers to a broad conceptualization of conditions including primary psychoses, such as schizophrenia and psychotic mood disorders, other disorders that are sometimes marked by psychotic features (e.g., borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder), and secondary psychotic disorders due to medical conditions or substances (e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium). As addressed in Ketter, et al. 2004 (“Psychotic Bipolar Disorders: Dimensionally Similar to or Categorically Different from Schizophrenia?,” cited in the Debate of Dimensional versus Categorical), controversy regarding relationships among mood disorders (particularly bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features) and schizophrenia is ongoing. The authors argue that while the respective dimensional (e.g., psychotic bipolar disorder as intermediate between non-psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorders) versus categorical debate persists, a mixed dimensional/categorical approach may best help elucidate pathophysiology and treatment options. Schizophrenia, specifically, is a severe and persistent form of mental illness often marked by positive symptoms (such as excesses and distortions in thoughts and sensory/perceptual experiences such as hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (behavioral deficits such as avolition, asociality, anhedonia, blunted affect, and alogia), disorganized symptoms (such as disorganized speech and behavior), movement symptoms (or grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior such as catatonia), and impairments in cognition (such as memory and frontal/executive functions that include, for example, planning ability and initiation). Kring, et al. 2014 (Abnormal Psychology, cited under the Schizophrenia Spectrum) provides an excellent introductory-level overview of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The etiological (or causal) basis of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders remains not wholly determined. Prevailing theories, however, ascribe to a diathesis-stress model, whereby biological factors (e.g., predispositions such as genetic liability) are believed to interact with adverse environmental factors (e.g., obstetric complications; adverse, stressful life events) over the course of development toward the manifestation of illness. This article offers a historical perspective of psychotic disorders, a review of etiological/theoretical models, a description of illness epidemiology and issues pertaining to sex differences and comorbidity, an outline of diagnostic considerations, a description of the schizophrenia spectrum, an examination of available assessment tools, the role of cognition/social cognition, a review of current evidence of neurobiological disruptions in psychosis (e.g., genetics, structural and functional neuroimaging, hormones, neurotransmitters, other aspects of maldevelopment in the central nervous system), other laboratory markers (e.g., perceptual and attentional abnormalities, smooth-pursuit eye movement dysfunction), environmental factors (such as stress, toxins, and familial-expressed emotion), the importance of gene-environment interactions in psychotic disorders, and, finally, current directions pertaining to prevention and treatment (pharmacological and psychosocial). While various psychotic-related disorders are addressed, this article focuses on the schizophrenia spectrum.",

Here, we report a 60‐year‐old male patient who presented with a sudden onset of disorientation and short‐term memory loss and started to ask about his whereabouts and what happened. He had no significant past medical or psychiatric disorder. Likewise, the patient did not have a recent history of head trauma, substance abuse, loss of consciousness, seizure disorder, or migraine. Neurologic examination was normal except for mild disorientation and short‐term memory impairment. He had a score of 18/30 on the mini‐mental state examination. Extensive laboratory investigations did not show any abnormal findings. Brain MRI and EEG were normal. His memory improved and returned to a normal baseline within 24 h from the onset. After the exclusion of potential causes and the patient returned to a normal state of memory, the diagnosis of transient global amnesia was made. At the follow‐up visit, the patient was in a state of normal function without a recurrence of memory impairment. Here, we presented this interesting case of transient global amnesia. TGA is a diagnosis of exclusion and is essential to keep in mind when evaluating a patient with acute onset of short‐term memory impairment, especially when etiological investigations reveal no potential cause.",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

      "abstract": "Depressive disorders are of interest to most researchers because of their prevalence and the fact that they are considered high-level psychosocial disorders. In modern psychiatry, the clinic of the adynamic component of depressive disorders is still not fully studied. Adynamic depression often has a long, chronic course. Psychopathological analysis of adynamic depression, identification of various variants of its course, helps to choose therapeutic tactics. Among patients with phase depressive disorder, mild and moderate depressive episodes in the form of mood unipolar, recurrent or bipolar disorder predominate, which are phenomenologically normal or panic subdepressions, seasonal depressions observed with loss of activity, agrippnik disorders, and included in apathy. The duration of these cases can be from several weeks to several months. The motivation for the use of drugs is consistent with the desire to improve the mental state of patients.",

      "title": "Procrastination, Perfectionism, and Other Work-Related Mental Problems: Prevalence, Types, Assessment, and Treatment—A Scoping Review",
      "abstract": "Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se , they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome—Psychiatric or Gynaecological Disorder?",
      "abstract": "The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of mental and physical symptoms arising in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms disappear after the onset of menstruation. During the rest of the follicular phase the patient is free from symptoms. The cyclical nature of the symptom variations is characteristic of the syndrome. The lack of a commonly accepted definition and a way to diagnose PMS has led to contradictory results in the search for its aetiology and treatment. The diagnosis of PMS should be based on prospective daily ratings of symptoms and defined criteria of subgroups. In our studies three subgroups can be identified. The \"Pure PMS\" group with significant cyclical symptoms being worse during the luteal phase and no symptoms during the follicular phase. A \"Premenstrual aggravation\" group with symptoms always present but with an aggravation premenstrually. A \"Non-PMS\" group of women who do not suffer from menstrual cycle related symptoms. These three groups show significant differences in the number of patients with an earlier psychiatric history and are different in the extent of neurosis on a personality test. The Pure PMS group had less neurosis and a lower frequency of patients with an earlier psychiatric history. In anovulatory cycles, whether induced or spontaneous, the cyclical nature of symptoms disappeared. This shows the important role that the corpus luteum has in precipitating symptoms in PMS. GnRH-agonists can be used to induce anovulation and this will stop the cyclical changes. Postmenopausal women receiving oestradiol/progestagen sequential treatment develop PMS-like symptoms when progestagen is added to the treatment. Symptoms seem to be dose dependent related to the oestradiol during the luteal but not the folicular phase. The intracerebral effects that cause the symptoms are still unknown. Progesterone metabolites have, however, been shown to interact with the GABA-A receptor in a similar manner to benzodiazepins and barbiturates, and they also have anxiolytic effects. Progesterone metabolites may occur which have the opposite effect on the GABA-A receptor, producing anxiogenic effects.",

      "abstract": "Le ralentissement psychomoteur dans la schizophrénie comprend un ensemble de symptômes dont les premières descriptions ont été rapportées par Bleuler et Kraepelin dans les années 1900. Néanmoins, peu d’études visant à comprendre la nature et le rôle du ralentissement psychomoteur ont été réalisées dans cette maladie. Si le ralentissement psychomoteur fait partie des critères diagnostiques du trouble dépressif caractérisé, il n’est pas actuellement considéré comme un élément central au diagnostic de schizophrénie. La catatonie est longtemps restée comme un sous-type de schizophrénie mais l’évolution du DSM dans sa 5 e version la considère comme une spécification pouvant être associée à d’autres troubles mentaux (trouble dépressif caractérisé, trouble bipolaire, trouble psychotique bref…). Pourtant le ralentissement psychomoteur est observé dès le début de la maladie et a un impact sur les capacités cognitives et le fonctionnement des patients schizophrènes. Le ralentissement de la performance sur les différentes mesures psychomotrices est associé, indépendamment du traitement, à la présence de symptômes négatifs et, dans une moindre mesure, à la présence de symptômes positifs et dépressifs [1]. Les études comparant les patients souffrant d’un trouble dépressif caractérisé avec des patients schizophrènes ont retrouvé un ralentissement global chez les patients déprimés alors qu’il était plus marqué au niveau cognitif pour les patients schizophrènes [2]. D’autres paramètres extrinsèques peuvent cependant influencer les symptômes psychomoteurs comme l’âge des patients ou les traitements antipsychotiques de première génération. La spécificité et l’impact pronostique du ralentissement psychomoteur chez les patients souffrant de schizophrénie nécessitent pour certains auteurs [3] de considérer les perturbations psychomotrices comme un critère diagnostique de schizophrénie.",

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wird über sechs Kinder mit paroxysmalen Kopfschmerzen infolge eines Krampfleidens berichtet. Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen. RESUMEN Se aportan seis casos de niños con cefaleas paroxísticas a consecuencia de enfermedades con crisis agudas.

Se discuten los factores diferenciales entre la crisis de cefalea y la migraña. Los ataques de cefalea pueden ser la única manifestación de crisis focales en el sistema límbico y otros puntos del córtex.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a devastating brain disease that affects ∼1% of the population worldwide and is characterized by a complex array of positive (delusions and hallucinations), negative (apathy and social withdrawal), and cognitive (deficits in attention and working memory) symptoms. Clinical features of schizophrenia frequently arise during late adolescence or early adulthood, which places this disease as the most chronic of the psychotic disorders and as one of the leading causes of disability and premature mortality (1). Increasing evidence suggests that cognitive impairment is at the core of schizophrenia and precedes the manifestation of psychosis (2). Furthermore, no pharmacological treatment is currently available for cognitive deficits, which are among the most debilitating symptoms of the disorder. The identification of novel treatments to ameliorate the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia thus seems crucial to improve the quality of life in these patients.",

      "abstract": "To gain new insights into the clinical presentation, causes, treatment and prognosis of epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), and to develop hypotheses to be tested in a prospective investigation.In this retrospective multicenter study, all cases were included that fulfilled these criteria: constantly repeated fragments of epileptic seizures, with preserved consciousness, lasting ≥ 1 h and representing locally restricted motor or sensory epileptic activity. Single episodes were included when they lasted for a minimum of 1 day. EPC with Rasmussen syndrome and acute stroke were excluded.Three time courses with two subtypes each were distinguished, that is, EPC as a solitary event (de novo or in preexistent epilepsy); chronic repetitive nonprogressive EPC (with frequent or rare episodes); and chronic persistent nonprogressive EPC (primarily or evolving out of an episodic course). These were unrelated to etiologies (morphologic lesions 34%, inflammatory 29%, systemic disorders 9%, idiopathic 5%, unknown 23%). Precipitation and inhibition of seizures is a frequent feature of EPC. Levetiracetam and topiramate have improved the possibilities for pharmacotherapy. Topiramate seems to be particularly effective with dysontogenetic etiologies.The existence of several clearly distinct courses of nonprogressive EPC is a new finding. These distinctions will be further investigated in a prospective study with precise protocols for electroencephalography (EEG), imaging, and other studies. This should better establish the relation of motor and somatosensory EPC; further clarify the relations, pathogenesis, and significance of the different types and their etiologies; and possibly identify more semiologic variants. It should also provide more precise knowledge about therapy and modification of ictogenesis by external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a typical onset in adolescence or young adulthood. Global lifetime prevalence is about 0.3–0.7% (van Os and Kapur, 2009). Symptoms can be divided into positive symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations), negative (deficit) symptoms (e.g., anhedonia, blunted affect, and avolition), and disorganization symptoms (e.g. disorganized speech). In addition, the majority of schizophrenia patients show cognitive dysfunctioning. In general, schizophrenia patients have deficits in most cognitive domains (e.g., attention, memory, and executive functioning) approximately one standard deviation below the normative mean (Mesholam-Gately et al., 2009). However, there is no specific cognitive profile that distinguishes schizophrenia patients from patients with other Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) diagnoses. Schizophrenia is often preceded by a prodromal period of months to years in which mild psychotic and other symptoms can occur and psycho-social functioning deteriorates.",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

It is characterized by complaints in several systems, has early onset and chronic fluctuating course, but without organic substrate. When the duration of symptoms is less than two years or they are less obvious, it is called Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder. Objectives This study reports the case of a female patient, previously healthy and with no psychiatric history, which abruptly presented lush somatic symptoms without organic origin. Case Presentation Case report of a previously healthy woman of 32 years, followed up for 14 months, by a sudden onset frame of profuse diarrhea, tenesmus, fecal incontinence, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss (18 kilos in 2 months), associated with headache and autonomic signs of anxious origin, without clear physical and/or psychogenic trigger. She had only a mild response to drug therapy and excellent improvement in symptoms after psychotherapy. Results Unconscious triggers came to light only after psychotherapy starts, justifying that the magnitude of autonomic somatoform symptoms surpasses the time period established by ICD-10 for Somatization Disorder. Therefore, the rapid resolution did not allow a diagnosis of Somatization Disorder, according to ICD-10. So, it was diagnosed as Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder. Conclusion It is suggested that the grandeur of clinical symptoms in this case is caused by psychogenic factors.

Are symptoms of depression due to organic illness and thus likely to respond to treatment of the underlying physical illness, or, on the other hand, are they of psychological origin and thus require counseling or antidepressant therapy? This difficulty, in part, arises from a lack of distinction between depressive symptoms and depressive disorder. Fleeting depressive symptoms (such as decreased energy, difficulty sleeping) are quite common among acutely ill medical patients (in or outside of the Veterans Administration system); however, such symptoms are often different in intensity and duration from those that comprise a major depressive disorder. The latter (by DSM-III-R criteria) requires a depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day for 2 weeks or longer, and the simultaneous presence of a constellation of",

Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them.

      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "title": "Long-term psychiatric disorders after traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "Summary In the long term after traumatic brain injury, the most disabling problems are generally related to neuropsychiatric sequelae, including personality change and cognitive impairment, rather than neurophysical sequelae. Cognitive impairment after severe injury is likely to include impaired speed of information processing, poor memory and executive problems. Personality change may include poor motivation, and a tendency to be self-centred and less aware of the needs of others. Patients may be described as lazy and thoughtless. Some become disinhibited and rude. Agitation and aggression can be very difficult to manage. Anxiety and depression symptoms are quite frequent and play a role in the development of persistent post-concussion syndrome after milder injury. Depression may be associated with a deterioration in disability over time after injury. Psychosis is not unusual though it has been difficult to confirm that traumatic brain injury is a cause of schizophrenia. Head injury may, many years later, increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Good rehabilitation probably minimizes the risk of psychiatric sequelae, but specific psychological and pharmacological treatments may be needed.",

      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

      "abstract": "Veel mensen in onze samenleving leiden aan regelmatige slaapproblemen of hebben gewoonweg niet voldoende tijd voor slaap. Wanneer slaapgebrek een chronisch probleem wordt zouden er wel eens veranderingen in hersenen en lichaam kunnen optreden die ernstige gevolgen hebben voor de psychische en fysieke gezondheid. Zo is er vaak gesuggereerd dat verstoorde slaap kan bijdragen aan het ontstaan van stemmingsstoornissen als depressie. In dit proefschrift worden studies beschreven naar de neurobiologische gevolgen van chronische slaaptekort in ratten. De dagelijkse hoeveelheid slaap werd tot minder dan de helft gereduceerd en in de weken daarna werden de gevolgen bestudeerd voor hersensystemen en hormonale processen die mogelijk betrokken zijn bij depressie. Hoewel een enkele dag van slaaptekort nog geen effecten had op deze systemen, waren er na een week al duidelijk veranderingen meetbaar in de gevoeligheid voor de neurotransmitter serotonine en in de regulatie van de hypofyse-bijnier as, het hormonale systeem dat betrokken is bij de reactie op stress. Na een maand van slaaptekort traden er zelfs morfologische veranderingen op in het brein. Er was een duidelijke afname in de grootte van de hippocampus, een hersengebied dat een belangrijke rol speelt bij de regulatie van emoties en cognitieve processen. Veel van de waargenomen neurobiologische en hormonale veranderingen na chronisch slaaptekort in ratten komen sterk overeen met afwijkingen die zijn vastgesteld bij depressieve patienten. De resultaten van deze studies leveren dan ook een sterke ondersteuning van de hypothese dat verstoorde slaap niet enkel een symptoom is van depressie maar, bij een deel van de patienten, mogelijk een causale rol speelt bij het ontstaan van de stemmingsstoornis.",

La Liga Internacional Contra la Epilepsia define al estado epileptico como una condicion resultante de la falla de los mecanismos responsables en la terminacion de una crisis o en la iniciacion de otros que conducen a crisis anormalmente prolongadas. El criterio del tiempo minimo para definir «estado epileptico» se redujo de 30 a cinco minutos, delimitado como actividad convulsiva continua o convulsiones recurrentes rapidas sin recuperacion de la conciencia durante mas de cinco minutos. Esta definicion considera que las crisis que persisten durante mas de cinco minutos probablemente lo haran durante mas de 30. El «estado epileptico refractario» es una crisis convulsiva que continua a pesar del tratamiento con benzodiacepina y medicamento antiepileptico. «Estado epileptico super refractario» es el que no responde a la medicacion anestesica o la recaida durante el retiro de estos farmacos. El estado epileptico se puede clasificar clinicamente en convulsivo, no convulsivo o refractario. Una vez hecho el diagnostico de estado epileptico, el tratamiento debe iniciar inmediatamente y debe tener los siguientes objetivos: terminar el evento, prevenir recurrencias, manejar las causas precipitantes y las complicaciones.

      "abstract": "The life-expectancy of a 1-year old child with mild/moderate handicap due to Down's syndrome (DS) is now 55 years. The mean age of onset of dementia in DS is 51.7 years (SD 7.1, range 31–68). Alzheimer-type changes in the brain are found after the age of 35. When the intellectual disability is severe, cognitive decline as such may be difficult to demonstrate, and a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) must often be based on the appearance of non-cognitive signs, including late-onset epilepsy, neurological changes, and progressive slowing of the EEG dominant rhythm. Longitudinal studies of DS adults have shown little or no decline in cognition and adaptive behaviour in the absence of dementia, depression, or physical illness. The distribution of the Apo-E polymorphism is similar to that in the normal population. The presence of established clinical dementia is associated with a high density of neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex, but the time over which these lesions evolve, together with the difficulties of early diagnosis of dementia in the intellectually disabled, may account for the lag between early pathological change and symptoms of clinical dementia. Whether a similar slow evolution of pathological change occurs in normal people is not known.",

If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 1a and “No” to Question 1b (parent reports past depression but denies current episode), the interviewer should assess suicide risk (Questions 12a–12d) and then skip to the section on Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 12a, 12b, 12c, or 12d, the interviewer should obtain further details and assess the child's current risk of harm to self or others. It is important to inquire about the specifics of plan, time of occurrence, frequency of such thoughts, details of the attempt, current absence or presence of ideation, and so on, and take appropriate preventative action. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires five “Yes” responses to Questions 4–12. At least one symptom must be depressed or irritable mood or loss of interest in usual activities. Also, the symptoms must occur together nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, and interference in functioning must be evident.",

Partial seizures arise from a localized region of cerebral cortex. The clinical manifestations of a partial seizure depend on where in the cortex it begins, and how fast and how far it spreads. Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner. Lip smacking or chewing movements, grimacing, undressing, the carrying out of purposeless activities or of aimless wandering may all occur on their own or in different combinations.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

Parmi les troubles psychiatriques comorbides à la maladie de Parkinson, la dépression est probablement la plus importante en termes de fréquence et d’impact. La prévalence de la dépression est particulièrement élevée, estimée à environ 40 %. Les symptômes dépressifs peuvent être évidents et même précéder les troubles moteurs de la maladie, cependant, le diagnostic d’épisode dépressif est le plus souvent complexe, en raison d’un chevauchement symptomatique des deux troubles. Pouvant inaugurer la maladie de Parkinson ou survenir plus tardivement, la dépression a un retentissement majeur sur l’autonomie fonctionnelle et la qualité de vie des patients. Il existe par ailleurs un lien entre dépression et troubles cognitifs chez les sujets atteints de maladie de Parkinson.

      "abstract": "Psychosis, mania, and catatonia can greatly hamper the ability of patients to care for themselves and of medical staff to care for them. We discuss psychosis, mania, and catatonia in three subsections as if they were separate entities, with one of the symptoms dominating (and when the symptom is not the result of delirium or dementia; see Chapter 4 \"Delirium,\" and Chapter 5 \"Dementia\"). In clinical practice, the distinction cannot always be made: patients with mania can be psychotic, or catatonia may occur in a manic or psychotic patient. In each of the subsections, we use the \"primary/secondary\" distinction even though it is not officially sanctioned by our current classification system (i.e., DSM-5 [American Psychiatric Association 2013]). Clinicians, however, base their diagnostic approach on this distinction: Are psychiatric symptoms attributable to a primary psychiatric syndrome, or are they secondary to medical diseases, substance use, or medication intoxication? In this chapter, we focus on management principles for medically hospitalized patients who are psychotic, manic, or catatonic, and place particular emphasis on the etiologies of secondary psychosis, mania, and catatonia. Psychotic symptoms due to toxic exposures are covered in Chapter 35, \"Medical Toxicology.\"",

      "abstract": "De Morsier syndrome, also known as septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), describes a triad of optic nerve hypoplasia, hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and midline abnormalities such as absent septum pellucidum or dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. It is a rare congenital disorder that an estimated incidence of 1/50,000 was recorded. This disease has a variety of clinical symptoms, which include visual manifestations (85-90%), intellectual delay (42.5-60%), seizures (27.5-55%) and endocrine abnormalities (50-55%). However, those patients with symptoms of global developmental delay and motor deficits could not be explained by the corpus callosum hypoplasia alone and were noted to manifest other underrecognized cortical malformations such as schizencephaly and polymicrogyria, hence termed De Morsier plus syndrome. In the Philippines, the existence of De Morsier plus syndrome with a lack of developmental disorders detected during adulthood is uncommon with no reported case yet. This report is a case of a 24-year-old, male, who presented with adult-onset seizure with associated eye symptoms. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral schizencephaly in both parietal lobes with absent septum pellucidum, polymicrogyria, agyria-pachygyria and optic nerve atrophy. On electroencephalogram, epileptiform discharges were noted in the left parietal area. This case was managed under anti-seizure medication with no seizure recurrence and a good outcome.",

      "title": "Trichotillomania: Its Classification and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder. The following article brings to light that this disorder man not be as rare as some clinicians think. The following discussion delineates Trichotillomania in terms of its descriptive characteristics, onset and course, associated disorders, relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and treatment. Research indicates a combination of psychopharmacology and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the choice of treatment for this disorder. Following the content discussion of Trichotillomania is a transcript of an interview with one of the authors (K. A.) who was previously diagnosed with Trichotillomania. INTRODUCTION Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder and is defined by the following five criteria listed in the DSM-IV (1994): a) recurrent pulling of one's hair resulting in noticeable hair loss, b) an increasing sense of tension immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior, c) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair, d) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition, e) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. (p. 621) This article seeks to provide an overview of Trichotillomania in terms of its history and descriptive characteristics, onset and course of illness, associated disorders, its relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and the treatment of choice for Trichotillomania. HISTORY AND DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS History In 1889 a French dermatologist, Hallopeau, described a man who pulled out his hair in large amounts (Swedo, 1993). Hallopeau used the term trichotillomania to describe this behavior. Before Hallopeau's encounter with his client, references to hair-pulling had already been documented. In 1779, Baudament reported on a 16-year-old boy who pulled out his hair and actually ate it. Eventually, this ingestion of hair led to gastrointestinal problems because the boy developed hair balls in his stomach (Christenson & Mackenzie, 1994). Once thought to be rare, this disorder is far from uncommon. It has been estimated that approximately eight million Americans are afflicted with this disorder (Azrin & Nunn, 1978). A survey conducted by Rothbaum, Shaw, Morris, and Ninan (1993) revealed that of the 490 college freshman respondents, 10% reported compulsive hair-pulling. Despite these statistics, the literature is very scarce regarding this disorder. Characteristics Trichotillomania is predominately found in the female population. Christenson, Mackenzie, and Mitchell (1991) found that 93% of 60 adult chronic hair-pullers were women. Likewise, Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that 70% of 43 sampled children, adolescents, and adults who were chronic hair-pullers were female. Christenson and Mackenzie (1994) found a more equal sex ratio in children under the age of six. Hair-pulling can occur from many body locations. A study done by Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that the most common area from which hair is pulled is the scalp, followed by eyelashes, eyebrows, pubis, body (arm/leg), and face (beard). Most individuals pluck hair from at least two sites, with sites varying over time. Those diagnosed with this disorder typically think that the hair that is pulled is somehow different from other hair. For example, chronic hair-pullers may pluck kinky or course hair so that they may feel right about their hair, thus reducing anxiety (Swedo & Rapoport, 1991.). After the hair is pulled, other ritualistic acts can follow. For instance, some individuals will play with or twirl their extracted hair, while others may brush it against their cheeks or lips. Some individuals will even go as far as ingesting their hair (trichophagia), possibly leading to gastrointestinal difficulties or even death (Swedo & Leonard, 1992). …",

Achalasia is seen in the gastroesophageal sphincter. Partial or complete failure of contraction occurs most commonly in the esophagus. In dyskinesia, the progressive sequence of the contraction is lost, and the entire organ or a part of it contracts simultaneously. Too much contraction for too long a period causes diffuse spasm. Refinements in technics of detection should result in better definition of esophageal motor disorders and better management of patients.",

      "title": "Galantamine in the Treatment of Minor Depression With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Dementia in an Elderly Woman",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Depression is present in about 20%–40% of dementia patients; 15%–50% of Alzheimer's dementia patients have depression.1,2 Depression is common in the early stages of the disease and remains fairly constant through most stages of Alzheimer's dementia.3 Depression exacerbates the cognitive deficits of the preexisting dementia. In Alzheimer's dementia, mild to moderate depression may also manifest as new onset of agitation, wandering, apathy, insomnia, or change in functional status. Depressive symptoms in dementia should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable “excess disability.”4\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, an 80-year-old woman, presented with a 2-year history of cognitive decline and an 8-month history of minor depression. Depression features included low mood with decreased interest in social activities, being less energetic, psychomotor slowing, and being more withdrawn and lonely. Sleep and appetite were good. She met only 3 of the 9 features of the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Her Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)5 score was 11/30. Her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia6 score for depression in dementia was 13. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)7 score was 22/30, and she met the DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer's dementia. Computed tomography scan of the brain revealed generalized atrophy.\r\n\r\nMs A was started on galantamine 8 mg orally twice a day, which was subsequently increased to 16 mg orally twice a day after 4 weeks. Her minor depression features responded very well with galantamine monotherapy after 2 months. At that time, her MMSE score was 23/30, her GDS score was 4/30, and her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia score was 6.\r\n\r\nDepression is associated with defects of multiple neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, catecholamine, and acetylcholine. Depression in Alzheimer's dementia is linked to catecholaminergic deficit or degeneration of serotonergic neurons, and this process is also known to occur early in Alzheimer's dementia.8\r\n\r\nGalantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and is used in the treatment of dementia. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors exist not only on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites but also on those located on axon terminals and are involved in the modulation of multiple neurotransmitter releases. Neuronal nAChR is a family of ligand-gated ion channels that are widely distributed in the brain and are controlled by acetylcholine and nicotine receptor agonists. In the genetically depressive rats, nicotine showed antidepressant-like effects through the involvement of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype. The α4 subunit in combination with the β2 subunit mediates dopaminergic and nonadrenergic release.9 Modulation of nAChR facilitates the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate.10 Striatal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with high affinity for nicotinic agonists are involved with the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine.11 Dopamine deficiency is associated with anhedonia, lack of interest, and psychomotor slowing (bradyphrenia), and it may arise as a consequence of cholinergic defects involving nAChR. Studies suggest galantamine in addition to mediating cholinergic neurotransmission also through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may influence several other neurotransmitter systems, possibly modulating the activity of serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and GABA in certain nerve tracts.12,13 So, it is possible that galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of dementia, may also have some antidepressant effect.\r\n\r\nIf large studies prove this effect, we may not need to use an antidepressant in addition to a cholinesterase inhibitor in patients who have depression with dementia. This means less medication usage and potentially less adverse effect to these patients.",

Depressive symptoms are a collection of behaviors and feelings that can be specifically classified as depression. Symptoms of depression are at least seen from three aspects, namely physical symptoms, psychic symptoms, and social symptoms. Some people have a negative stigma about individuals affected by mental disorders such as depression, some studies show data on affected individuals exposed to negative stigma, one of which was shown by McLean Hospital in 2020 which showed that 75% of individuals with mental disorders had been stigmatized by society. The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders. The results showed that faith can be a factor that can improve the mental health of an individual.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dravet syndrome (DS) is associated with severely refractory seizures. Recent studies suggest possible antiepileptic effects of serotonergic drugs. We report the case of a 25-year-old woman with DS-related epilepsy (SCN1A mutation), with daily seizures since childhood, associated with developmental delay. Several antiepileptic drug regimens were tested, without clear benefit. Over the years, she maintained a pattern of diurnal and nocturnal seizures, with a nocturnal predominance averaging two tonic–clonic seizures per night, with periods of seizure clusters. On routine electroencephalography (EEG), frequent, subtle myoclonic seizures during sleep were detected. A seizure-free period or significant reduction in seizure frequency was never attained. Trazodone was started due to insomnia. This led to a remarkable as well as long-standing clinical and neurophysiological improvement: less than one reported tonic–clonic seizure per month during the next 18 months, reduction in interictal epileptiform activity (170/h vs. 30/h of sleep), myoclonic seizures (90/h vs. 0.7/h of sleep), and tonic–clonic seizures (2/night to 0) on video-EEG. Serotonergic pathway modulation effects on DS-related epilepsy were observed in animal studies, in addition to small case series using lorcaserin and fenfluramine. To the best of our knowledge, no clinical data exist showing that trazodone may be an efficacious agent in patients with DS. Despite limitation of an isolated case with possible chance factors, our data, given the striking effect, provide this clinical evidence for the first time, and may have important clinical implications in patients with DS, reinforcing the need for further research on this subject.",

The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders.

      "abstract": "Psychomotor activity is one of the traits we most immediately perceive in others. Psychomotor slowing, which can be easily noticed on a first medical examination, is a symptom which may be prodromal of psychic disturbances. Historically, psychomotor retardation is a characteristic attached to depression, especially melancholia. Some studies show that psychomotor retardation is associated with good therapeutic prognosis, including positive response to electro-convulsivo-therapy. The cluster of non-verbal symptoms includes both basic aspects related to motor behavior such as attitudes and movements and more complex aspects such as goal-directed behaviors. We will see that this intuitive and fundamental dimension of clinical depression is not homogeneous. From a motor point of view, hypo-bradykinesia in depression may be compared to the one found in cortico-subcortical syndromes such as Parkinson's disease. This comparison suggests that key brain structures such as the basal ganglia could be involved in depression. Moreover, the loss of vital energy is the dominant psychopathological explanation linked to psychomotor retardation. From a phenomenological point of view, this interpretation seems to be relevant but appears disappointing as an experimental variable. However, motivation, understood as the factor that energizes the behavior seems to be an interesting and promising concept. Experimentally, it is possible to measure how much an individual is able to invest energy in order to achieve a goal. The impact of depression on the process of incentive motivation will be analyzed before turning to a description of therapeutic interventions related to psychomotor field such as sports or sensorimotor stimulations that appear to be promising tracks for clinical improvement.",

The episodes are not stereotyped, they are not followed by headache, nor do they associate other neurological symptoms. Neurological examination and complementary tests were normal. It is concluded in favor of typical aura without headache and after six months of starting treatment with Lamotrigine there were no recurrences. Final conclusion: The diagnosis of typical aura without headache begins with an adequate anamnesis. Due to the nature of its manifestations it is necessary to differentiate it from other etiologies such as transient ischemic attacks and focal seizures due to the diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications. It may appear, as in this case, in patients with migraine without aura. Lamotrigine is an excellent therapeutic option in the typical aura without headache.",

      "abstract": "In schizophrenia, the years before psychosis are morbid, not premorbid. Widespread, low-grade corruption of circuitry (brain damage) occurs, resulting in enduring deficits in cognitive, social, and motor functioning and motivation. These deficits persist during patients’ lifetime and do not respond to medication or talking. Expectations of patients’ functioning must be modified (reduced); interactions and environments must be accommodated to support best residual functioning, and prostheses (mechanical or actions of others) must replace functions no longer available. One of the deficits—anosognosia—interferes with treatment efforts. When the circuits managing dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area are corrupted, storms of dopamine imbue random items of sensory experience and intrapsychic life with salience—psychosis appears. Early and uninterrupted dopamine antagonist medication results in sustained remission of psychosis but is rarely achieved because of the inadequacies of standard care. Enduring engagement by multi-disciplinary teams is the necessary response to the neurobiology of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Cytochrome p4502D6 and Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism in Patient with Bipolar Disorder Type II",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric entity, which represents a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The very definition and classification of BD is determined by a range of possible clinical presentations, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric entities by means of a differential diagnosis, for example acute schizophrenic episode, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Furthermore, BD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse disorders, but also personality disorders or eating disorders, [1-4] which complicate the diagnosis and treatment further.BD can manifest itself for years with recurring depressive episodes before the first manic, hypomanic or mixed episode occurs. The depressive episode of the BD thus frequently remains unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a major depressive disorder (MDD), and therefore inadequately treated with antidepressant monotherapy. According to the current psychiatric classification DSM-V, BD is not diagnosed before an occurrence of a manic or hypomanic episode, while ICD-10 describes, besides a manic and hypomanic episode, a mixed episode in BD as well. [5,6] However, a clinician can consider bipolar depression based on clinical characteristic of depressive episodes. Disease onset before the age of 20, recurrent depressive episodes, which cause the person to be ill most of the time, failure to respond to antidepressants, severe psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, increased appetite, presence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideations are frequently present in patients with bipolar depression. [7,8]Data on prevalence of mood disorders is significantly changing in the last decade. According to past epidemiological data, BD I is responsible for about 2% of prevalence among mood disorders, in the same percentage as BD II. MDD has been diagnosed in 86% of all patients with mood disorders, and non-specific mood disorder in 10% of the patients. Today, we believe that MDD represents 50 % of all mood disorders, BD I about 2%, BD II 15%, while 33% of mood disorders belong to a heterogeneous group of disorders from the bipolar spectrum. [9] Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the pharmaco-therapeutic approach and introduce mood stabilizers to the treatment if BD or a disorder from the bipolar spectrum is suspected. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of the depressive episode, and all medical history data on patients with depression should be carefully analyzed for evidence of possible episodes of elevated mood in the past.Clinical research has shown that the individual therapeutic response to psychotropic drugs considerably varies, from tendency to develop side effects to therapeutic resistance. In the treatment of a depressive episode, about one third of the patients show no therapeutic response after an adequate therapeutic trial. [8] It is a well known fact the therapeutic response can be affected by different factors, such as the age of the patient, liver or kidney dysfunction, diet, smoking or excessive alcohol use. Recent research shows the lack of response to antidepressant treatment is associated with bipolar disorder, [10] and the association of other psychopathological phenomena with the lack of therapeutic response is also being investigated. However, it is believed that the genetic basis is of key importance for the variability of response to antidepressants. [11,12] Pharmacogenetics studies the influence of specific gene polymorphisms, which are responsible for the function of enzymes important in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) superfamily, which consists of more than 50 different enzymes. CYP2D6 has an important role in biotransformation of a large number of antidepressants. [13,14] The gene that encodes the CYP2D6 is located at the locus 22q13. …",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

      "abstract": "The term sella (ESS) indicates the presence of an enlarged Sella turcica which contains a remodeled pituitary gland by pressing it against the back and lower wall of the sellar space. The condition is the result of the expansion of the subarachnoid space in the sella as a result of the incomplete continuity of the sellar diaphragm. There are two types of empty sella syndrome (ESS) with a difference in repercussions on the endocrine system. Therefore, with regard to etiology, empty Sella syndrome may be primary, if there is no pathological process in the selar region itself which is the cause of damage to the pituitary gland, or secondary, if it was caused by a specific pathological process. Primary empty sella syndrome (PESS) may be an incidental finding or can be registered with imaging methods of examination of patients presented with endocrine disorders, neurological symptoms, visual disturbances, etc. It may be caused by intracranial hypertension and/or selar diaphragm insufficiency in patients who have not previously documented any pathology of the pituitary gland. Secondary empty sella syndrome (SESS) is much more frequent and associated with various pathological conditions and processes of the selar region. The presence of intrasellar masses changes the normal anatomy of the diaphragm, stretching, enlarging and thining it, and increases the chances of developing arachnoid adhesions that can withdraw the SVS to the sellar cavity. Radiotherapy, surgery, medication therapy, infections, post-partum pituitary necrosis, trauma and spontaneous resolution may induce a reduction in the sellar mass and stimulate the emergence of secondary empty sella syndrome associated with the development of scar tissue tissues, which after a few months of retraction can pull the supraselar structures causing visual deficits. The disease is treated appropriately to the disorder-medical therapy of endocrine disorders, surgical excision of intrasellar masses and adhesions and reduction of intracranial pressure.",

It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving.

Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts.

The first is that in which signs and symptoms in somatic organs are seen to accompany specific mental disease, such as dementia precox. This relationship is well known and accepted. An illustration is the depressed phase of manic depressive psychosis which is frequently accompanied by periodic tachycardia, amenorrhea or loss of weight. The second aspect of psychosomatic medicine suggests that specific somatic diseases are influenced by mental states. Thus, peptic ulcer is aggravated when the patient is distressed or under tension and apt to be improved during periods of physical and emotional relaxation. The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently. This maintains that repeated emotional or psychologic stress may actually produce certain somatic diseases, such as asthma, essential hypertension or eczematoid dermatitis. The present discussion will concern itself with only the",

      "title": "Fatigue after Depression Responds to Therapy: What Are the Next Steps? A Sufficient Base of Evidence Is Often Lacking to Guide Pharmacotherapy for Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Fatigue and depression can be viewed as a vicious cycle: Fatigue can be a symptom of major depression, and fatigue can be a risk factor for depression. (1) For example, fatigue associated with a general medical condition or traumatic brain injury can be a risk factor for developing major depressive disorder (MDD). (1-3) It isn't surprising that fatigue has been studied as a predictor of relapse after previous response to treatment in patients with MDD. Despite the observed association between fatigue and depression, their underlying relationship often is unclear. The literature does not differentiate among fatigue associated with depression, fatigue as a treatment-emergent adverse effect, and fatigue as a residual symptom of depression that is partially responsive to treatment. (4,5) To complicate the situation, many medications used to treat MDD can cause fatigue. Patients often describe fatigue as (1) feeling tired, exhausted, or drained and (2) lacking energy and motivation. Fatigue can be related to impaired wakefulness but is believed to be a different entity than sleepiness. (6) Residual fatigue can affect social, cognitive, emotional, and physical health. We reviewed the literature about fatigue as a symptom of MDD by conducting a search of Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, using keywords depression, fatigue, residual symptoms, and treatment. We chose the papers cited in this article based on our consensus and because these publications represent expert opinion or the highest quality evidence available. Residual fatigue has an effect on prognosis Fatigue is a common symptom of MDD that persists in 20% to 30% of patients whose symptoms of depression otherwise remit. (4,7-9) Several studies have linked residual fatigue with the overall prognosis of MDD. (5) Data from a prospective study demonstrate that depressed patients have a higher risk of relapse when they continue to report symptoms of fatigue after their symptoms of depression have otherwise entered partial remission. (10) Another study demonstrated that the severity of residual symptoms of depression is a strong predictor of another major depressive episode. (11) In a large-scale study the prevalence of residual fatigue after adequate treatment of MDD in both partial responders and remitters was 84.6%. (12) The same study showed that one-third of patients who had been treated for MDD had persistent and clinically significant fatigue, which could suggest a relationship between fatigue and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants. Another study demonstrated that 64.6% of patients who responded to antidepressant treatment and who had baseline fatigue continued to exhibit symptoms of fatigue after an adequate trial of an antidepressant. (13) Neurobiological considerations Studies have shown that the neuronal circuits that malfunction in fatigue are different from those that malfunction in depression. (14) Although the neurobiology of fatigue has not been determined, decreased neuronal activity in the prefrontal circuits has been associated with symptoms of fatigue. (15) In addition, evidence from the literature shows a decrease in hormone secretion (16) and cognitive abilities in patients exhibiting symptoms of fatigue. (17) These findings have led some experts to hypothesize that symptoms of fatigue associated with depression could be the result of (1) immune dysregulation (18) and (2) an inability of available antidepressants to target the underlying biology of the disorder. (2) Despite the hypothesis that fatigue associated with depression might be biologically related to immune dysregulation, some authors continue to point to an imbalance in neurotransmitters--norepinephrine, histamine, dopamine, acetylcholine--as being associated with fatigue. (14) For example, a study demonstrated that drugs targeting noradrenergic reuptake inhibition were more effective at preventing a relapse of fatigue compared with serotonergic drugs. …",

Withdrawal dyskinesia appears under similar circumstances but disappears spontaneously in 6 to 12 weeks. Cholinergic overactivity and changes in dopamine-acetylcholine balance in the basal ganglia may underlie these withdrawal syndromes. The principal value of the concept of covert dyskinesia is in the secondary and tertiary prevention of tardive dyskinesia through early discovery and treatment.",

In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain, Psychopathology, and DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nThe neurophysiological mechanisms and comorbidities of anxiety and depression with chronic pain cited by the authors1 serve as evidence of correlation, not causality. When A (neurophysiological mechanism) and B (symptom of chronic pain) occur together, it cannot be concluded that A causes B, because it could just as well be that B causes A, or a third factor causes both. Regarding the comorbidity of chronic pain with anxiety or depression, it could be that these forms of psychological distress result from chronic pain due to physical impairment, that the pain is a symptomatic expression of anxiety or depression, or that underlying psychosocial issues are causing both. A mentor of mine used to say, “You can’t have a bad thought without a bad molecule, and you don’t know which comes first,” and this paper proves that adage.\r\n\r\nWhen a symptom or condition is diagnosed as psychosomatic, this should not be done solely by exclusion, that is, lack of objective medical evidence. There should be positive substantiation through identification of psychological factors that provide an understanding of what is going on in the life of the patient. The ability to at least ballpark such situations should be in the therapeutic armamentarium of every physician, while psychiatrists should be able to provide biopsychosocial formulations as a core skill. By doing so, we help our patients by empowering them to deal with real life problems, as opposed to placing them in a position of passivity as recipients of a medical solution. Problems occur when psychosomatic diagnoses are communicated poorly, such as “There’s nothing really wrong with you” or “It’s all in your head,” and when patients are not ready to assume psychological ownership of personal problems. Either of these can result in demonization of physicians who make such diagnoses, in the former case justifiably, not so the latter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the diagnosis of tension headaches seems to have disappeared from the medical lexicon, because everyone has migraines. Despite their potential severity, tension headaches are not seen as medical enough, place an onus on patients to deal with whatever source of tension is causing the headaches, and places physicians who make this diagnosis at risk of demonization for allegedly blaming patients and minimizing their suffering. By contrast, the diagnosis of migraine is perceived as more validating and more supportive, leading to a proliferation of migraine diagnoses and treatments.\r\n\r\nJust as the failure to make a medical diagnosis can have serious consequences in patients with chronic pain and other medically unexplained symptoms, so, too, can the neglect of a psychosomatic diagnosis, in terms of extensive and fruitless investigations and consultations, iatrogenic complications of questionable treatments, and reinforcement of illness–disabled role issues at the expense of dealing with real problems. The mind is more than the sum of the neurochemical parts of the brain, and the failure to recognize this places us at risk of falling into a mindless brand of psychiatry.2",

In this article the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is syncope. Prior to loss of consciousness the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision with loss of colour vision ('greying' out) and finally a complete loss of vision (hence 'blacking' out) occurs. Hearing loss may occur following loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately 7 s in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.",

In contrast to the symptoms of neurosis, psychotic symptoms are categorically outside the normal realm of experience, and as such they are beyond our common-sense powers of understanding and empathy. It is this aspect of psychotic symptoms that isolates persons experiencing them in \"a world of their own\". The availability of anti-psychotic drugs means that many sufferers today can obtain significant relief from symptoms. The experiences of persons in the grip of psychotic episodes recorded in centuries past are remarkably similar to the kinds of feelings and ideas described by sufferers. Delusions may present as part of a complex of psychotic phenomena as in schizophrenia, mania, or psychotic depression, or as the lone, predominant psychotic feature of a paranoid psychosis.

Nach der „Global Burden of Disease”-Studie der WHO gehören depressive Störungen schon jetzt zu den Erkrankungen, die zum größten Verlust an Lebensjahren aufgrund der Beeinträchtigung durch die Störung führen. Depressionen werden von den Betroffenen als beeinträchtigender erlebt als die meisten somatischen Erkrankungen. Hinzu kommt, dass viele chronische somatische Erkrankungen im Verlauf durch das Hinzutreten einer depressiven Störung weiter verkompliziert werden. Bei vielen Erkrankten wird die Diagnose nur mit großer Verzögerung oder gar nicht gestellt, und wenn sie richtig gestellt wird, erfolgt die Behandlung oft nur unzureichend. Wahrscheinlich werden weniger als 10 % der Betroffenen medikamentös adäquat behandelt. Dies liegt auch daran, dass nach wie vor nicht nur z.B. Patienten mit schizophrenen Störungen oder Substanzabhängigkeiten von gesellschaftlicher Stigmatisierung betroffen sind, sondern auch Patienten mit depressiven Störungen. Auch dies trägt dazu bei, dass viele von dieser schwerwiegenden Erkrankung Betroffene den Gang zum Arzt scheuen. Konsens ist heute auch, dass das Ziel der Behandlung nicht mehr nur die Response, d.h. das (partielle) Ansprechen auf die Therapie, sein darf, sondern dass in jedem Fall die Remission angestrebt werden muss.",

If one views the effects of depression on cognition as falling on a continuum, it is generally evident that individuals with dysthymia or only mild-to-moderate depressive symptomatology, despite their subjective complaints of memory impairment, demonstrate little, if any, objectively verifiable cognitive impairment. At the other extreme of the continuum, major depression can lead to such pervasive cognitive dysfunction, accompanied by impairments in occupational and social functioning, that an individual is diagnosed as having a dementia syndrome.",

      "abstract": "There is a considerable overlap of psychotic and mood symptoms in patients with severe mental disorders, and a large proportion of patients meeting diagnostic criteria experience significant mood symptoms. The diagnosis of schizophrenia – schizoaffective type /schizoaffective disorder has been a part of the Diagnostic and statistical manual since the DSM-I. Even if the need for a diagnosis capturing this particular clinical picture obviously is needed, the agreement about when to use the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder as well as the diagnostic reliability is low. There is an agreement that the diagnosis covers episodes with an overlap between a psychotic episode meeting the A criteria for schizophrenia and a major mood episode where the psychotic symptoms continue after the end of the mood symptoms. Given the prevalence of depression in schizophrenia, some episodes, however, meet the criteria for schizoaffective disorders while others do not. The DSM-5 thus argues that the pattern of overlapping symptoms should be present in the majority of episodes. Keeping the cross-sectional approach favoured by previous versions of the DSM and the ICD will here continue to spread diagnostic confusion. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Children Presenting With Complex Febrile Seizures Do Not Routinely Need Computed Tomography Scanning in the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "The most common seizures experienced by young children are febrile seizures,1,2 which affect up to 4% to 5% of children ≤5 years old in the United States and Europe.1,2 In other portions of the world, the frequency may exceed 10% to 15%.2 Febrile seizures are defined as seizures associated with a febrile illness in the absence of central nervous system infection or acute electrolyte imbalance in children >1 month of age without previous afebrile seizures.3 These seizures have been defined further as simple or complex: simple febrile seizures are generalized seizures that last <15 minutes and do not recur within 24 hours,3,4 and complex febrile seizures are defined as focal and/or prolonged (>15 minutes) and/or occur in a series over 24 hours.3,4 The associated morbidity and mortality from febrile seizures is extremely low, with no associated adverse cognitive outcomes even when the seizures are prolonged.1,5,6 Risk factors predicting first febrile seizure, recurrent febrile seizures, and subsequent epilepsy have been well enumerated1 (see Table 1).Although there has existed ample investigation and data concerning initial management, treatment approaches, and outcomes in children with simple febrile seizures, there has been somewhat less well-developed data concerning complex febrile seizures. This is particularly true in regards to neuroimaging in the context of complex febrile seizures in an emergency-department setting. In this issue of Pediatrics, Teng et al7 provide solid footing to avoid unnecessary neuroimaging within the emergency-department context in children who present with complex febrile seizures. Data from 79 children with a first complex febrile seizure (72% with a single complex feature and 28% with multiple complex features) and no prior neurologic, neurosurgical, or chronic medical illness were presented. These subjects were identified by careful criteria and represented 27% of a total of 293 children who presented with a first febrile seizure. Eight children were ultimately excluded from study: 4 because of a history of developmental delays; 2 because of previous unprovoked seizures; and 2 because of lack of follow-up.7 Thus, the final cohort of subjects included 71 children: 49 subjects (79%) were described as well appearing; 2 (3%) were lethargic or inconsolable; and 11 (18%) were described as “unclear” in general appearance.7 Among the subjects studied, 24 had focal seizures and 14 had prolonged isolated or multiple prolonged seizure events. Emergency neuroimaging with computed tomography (CT) scanning was obtained in 10 subjects. An additional 36 subjects underwent MRI imaging within 1 week as part of a prospective study. No subject had significant intracranial pathology requiring emergency medical or neurosurgical intervention.7These findings both complement and amplify available published data on children with complex febrile seizures (see Table 2). Previously published studies were comprised of children presenting to emergency departments with seizures that were later subdivided into first seizure, epilepsy, simple febrile seizures, complex febrile seizures, and seizures that were symptomatic or idiopathic. The current study is only the second large-scale study that focused on the prospective recruitment of subjects with complex febrile seizures.Subjects were identified both concurrently (during evaluation by a treating physician) and later (through chart and log-book review by research assistants). Subjects had eligibility criteria carefully applied so that ascertainment was likely to have been nearly complete. However, data-collection forms were completed for most but not all subjects (62 of 71 [87%]). Still, this is a major accomplishment and points out the challenge of conducting clinical research projects with the cooperation and coordination of multiple providers over an extended period of time (3 years). Absolute short-term outcomes were known for the 46 subjects (65%) who eventually underwent neuroimaging. Reliable longer-term outcomes were available for 25 subjects (17%) who were contacted by telephone within the subsequent 4 to 44 months (median: 22.4 months) and the remaining 13 subjects (18%) for whom medical-chart review was needed.Previously published retrospective data have demonstrated variable utilization rates of neuroimaging for subjects who presented with complex febrile seizures (Table 2). Children with complex febrile seizures are not easily extrapolated from some composite and heterogeneous studies. However, there are few subjects identified with abnormalities on neuroimaging (CT scanning used to a greater degree than MRI). These abnormalities have generally been without requirement for additional medical or surgical intervention, similar to that demonstrated in the study by Teng et al.7 There are isolated case reports of brain abscess, nonaccidental trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, encephalitis, etc that present as what was thought to be a complex febrile seizure. Clinical course later identified the child as requiring additional evaluation. Prolonged alteration in mental status, meningismus, persisting postictal focal deficits, and toxic appearance, among others, should raise clinical suspicion. Therefore, from a practical point of view, in an emergency-department setting the question that should be asked is, “what important and clinically relevant data requiring immediate intervention will be learned by obtaining an emergency CT scan for this patient at this time?” The answer would most often seem to be none. There are always individual patients who may have clinically significant neuroimaging findings that would be better evaluated with MRI at presentation or at a later time. These treatment decisions need to be determined individually to avoid the impulse to routinely obtain a CT scan in each child presenting with a complex febrile seizure. As the authors in the current study and previous authors have emphasized, underlying medical conditions such as meningitis, encephalitis, and/or abscess need to be suspected clinically and evaluated for specifically in this context.1,2,6,15 Hospitalization and continued observation may be necessary. Later neuroimaging with MRI may be considered in children who present with complex febrile seizures if risk factors for subsequent epilepsy exist or there is a need to further evaluate underlying neurologic symptoms, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, or symptomatic seizures (brain dysgenesis, neurocutaneous syndrome, etc). It remains controversial whether febrile seizures, particularly prolonged complex febrile seizures, cause the later development of mesial temporal sclerosis.16 Retrospective studies have suggested that complex febrile seizures are a causative factor, whereas prospective studies have not.16 Genetic and environmental factors exert an up to now less-well-studied but significant influence.16Factors unrelated to the clinical evaluation of the patient are often at work when neuroimaging is obtained in an emergency-department setting. Among these include insistence by parents because of high anxiety, the relative ease of CT scanning availability, and relative lack of accessibility to specialty consultation. Although neuroimaging may help to allay some anxiety regarding serious intracranial pathology, it is unnecessary in most circumstances and may carry with it a longer-term risk of radiation-induced morbidity. Although these radiation risks are small for the individual, they are appreciable when you consider the population-based estimates of lifetime cancer mortality risks.17,18 There is generally an additional need for the administration of conscious sedation. This itself carries additional risks both directly from possible respiratory depression and indirectly by obscuring the clarity of subsequent mental status examination. Furthermore, MRI would be a more sensitive and clinically useful neuroimaging tool for most patients who are undergoing neurologic evaluation in the absence of suspected trauma or an immediate neurosurgical problem.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Non–convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is defined as prolonged seizure activity in the absence of motor features or a change in behaviour and/or mental processes from baseline associated with continuous epileptiform discharges on electroencephalogram (EEG). The absence of obvious motor features undoubtedly is in part responsible for the fact that NCSE is probably an under recognised clinical entity. We present two clinical cases of NCSE which illustrate the subtly in diagnosis even in experienced hands, the clinical spectrum of the disorder, the role and accessibility of investigations and its treatable nature. <h3>Case histories</h3> Case 1: A 55–year–old woman, with unclassified epilepsy characterised by sleep–related generalised tonic–clonic seizures well controlled on carbamazepine, presented with new onset ‘vague’ episodes. She described these as a feeling of vagueness, as if in a ‘zombie’–state with difficulty talking and interacting, yet with retained awareness. The episodes were of 4–48 hours in duration and had increased in frequency despite dose escalations of carbamazepine. She was able to continue working throughout and continued to drive. Case 2: A 52–year–old woman with learning disability and symptomatic focal epilepsy characterised by daily simple focal seizures secondary to a childhood encephalitic illness of unknown aetiology, presented with a 4–week history of declining social function and speech output. She had been free of generalised tonic–clonic seizures for many years, and was taking carbamazepine and levetiracetam. Over the previous 4 weeks she had become increasingly emotional, lost the ability to stand, had become incontinent of urine and had stopped playing card games; her favourite pastime. <h3>Investigations</h3> In case 1 an interictal EEG recording was unremarkable, so in order to increase the EEG yield an on–demand/rapid–access/walk–in EEG was facilitated in order to capture a clinical event. This capitalised on her employment in a hospital setting and required negotiation with the local neurophysiology department. Case 2 was admitted following a generalised tonic–clonic seizure whereupon an EEG was performed. <h3>Results and conclusions</h3> The diagnosis of NCSE in both cases was confirmed on an ictal EEG recording. Both cases help to illustrate the diverse clinical spectrum of NCSE, its disabling nature in those with learning disability, and often it9s clinical subtly in high–functioning individuals. It also serves to highlight that continuous electrical activity in some cases of NCSE although altering awareness; individuals may still be able to function at work and albeit unknowingly against DLVA guidelines, continue to drive while awaiting investigations and a diagnosis. These two clinical case vignettes raise the profile of the spectrum of NSCE and highlight the need for continued investment in the timely availability of EEG.",

Epilepsy is defined as the tendency to have seizures, practically as two unprovoked seizures at least 24 hours apart or one seizure with a 60% chance of additional seizures. The two overall epilepsy types are generalized and focal. Focal epilepsy most commonly indicates a focal brain injury like traumatic brain injury or tumor. In contrast, generalized epilepsy is due to a genetic etiology, not necessarily inherited. An epilepsy diagnosis is clinically made and can be supported by typical EEG and MRI findings. Nearly 4% of people develop epilepsy, with the largest peak during later years and the second peak during childhood. Nearly 70% of people are seizure-free after five years, whether via control with medications or, less commonly, the epilepsy itself remits. Life expectancy for epilepsy patients is lower. A key contributor to epilepsy mortality is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Uncontrolled generalized tonic clonic seizures are a key risk factor for SUDEP.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is characterized by chronic subjective dizziness, phobic postural vertigo, and related disorders. For at least 3 months, it exhibits varying symptoms of vertigo, unsteadiness, or dizziness. Methods: Research articles regarding PPPD were searched by viewing the Scopus, PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases online. A search strategy using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis was used. Results: It presents a typical chronic vestibular system and brain malfunction that result in persistent dizziness, nonspinning vertigo, and/or unsteadiness. Persistent nonvertiginous dizziness and hypersensitivity to motion and visual stimuli are the main signs and symptoms of PPPD. These symptoms appeared either when there were no active neuro-otologic illnesses or when an episodic vestibular condition was present but could not completely account for the symptoms. Psychological mechanisms that resemble cognitive models of health anxiety and panic disorder are involved in the PPPDs development and maintenance. Conclusion: Since PPPDs diagnostic criteria only involve symptoms, the patient's clinical history is crucial in making the diagnosis. Once diagnosed, effective communication and personalized treatment plans, such as serotonergic medicines, cognitive behavioral therapy, and specialized physical therapy (vestibular rehabilitation), help manage PPPD. Since PPPD is a relatively recent clinical diagnosis, many medical practitioners who treat patients who feel dizzy are unfamiliar with it.",

      "abstract": "Migraine is a common disabling primary headache disorder that affects an estimated 36 million A mericans. Migraine headaches often occur over many years or over an individual's lifetime. By definition, episodic migraine is characterized by headaches that occur on fewer than 15 days per month. According to the recent I nternational C lassification of H eadache D isorders (third revision) beta diagnostic criteria, chronic migraine is defined as “headaches on at least 15 days per month for at least 3 months, with the features of migraine on at least 8 days per month.” However, diagnostic criteria distinguishing episodic from chronic migraine continue to evolve. Persons with episodic migraine can remit, not change, or progress to high‐frequency episodic or chronic migraine over time. Chronic migraine is associated with a substantially greater personal and societal burden, more frequent comorbidities, and possibly with persistent and progressive brain abnormalities. Many patients are poorly responsive to, or noncompliant with, conventional preventive therapies. The primary goals of migraine treatment include relieving pain, restoring function, and reducing headache frequency; an additional goal may be preventing progression to chronic migraine. Although all migraineurs require abortive treatment, and all patients with chronic migraine require preventive treatment, there are no definitive guidelines delineating which persons with episodic migraine would benefit from preventive therapy. Five US F ood and D rug A ssociation strategies are approved for preventing episodic migraine, but only injections with onabotulinumtoxin A are approved for preventing chronic migraine. Identifying persons who require migraine prophylaxis and selecting and initiating the most appropriate treatment strategy may prevent progression from episodic to chronic migraine and alleviate the pain and suffering associated with frequent migraine.",

      "abstract": "A case is presented of a 37-year-old black woman with a 5-year history of a chronic psychotic illness, diagnosed as schizophrenia, who presented to the emergency room complaining of a severe headache, while appearing confused and experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations. The purpose of this case study is to illustrate the way in which the appellation of schizophrenia can be misapplied in a patient with a complicated medical history and poor follow-up evaluation and treatment.Patients with active psychosis are frequently unable to provide a coherent or comprehensive medical history. In the absence of obvious indications to the contrary, a diagnosis of a primary psychiatric illness is often assumed, especially if this label has been applied in the past. However, the differential diagnosis of psychosis is extensive.This patient was given a complete psychiatric and neurologic evaluation, and aspects of the history that had been lost or ignored were uncovered and reevaluated.A diagnosis other than schizophrenia was made and another treatment, other than antipsychotic drugs, was initiated. The patient responded rapidly with improved cognitive function and resolution of her psychotic symptoms.This case serves to illustrate how the absence of a careful clinical assessment and historical case review, in patients who have been previously labeled as schizophrenic, can perpetuate misdiagnoses and inappropriate treatments. It highlights the importance, especially in patients with an incomplete medical history, of ruling out all organic causes of psychosis to avoid inappropriately labeling someone as having a psychiatric illness.",

      "title": "The Impact of (the Concept of) Treatment-Resistant Depression: An Opinion Review",
      "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression refers to major depressive disorder, treatment of the disorder, and failure to obtain an \"acceptable\" outcome. Regarding the disorder, the heterogeneous concept of major depressive disorder and the multiple definitions of treatment-resistant depression, hesitating between a categorical and a more dimensional approach, as well as the divergence between diagnostic criteria and the items in the assessment scales are a source of confusion. Classifications do not take into account the dramatic influence of patient characteristics strongly impacting outcome, although these can be the cause of so-called pseudo-resistance. Outcome is the result of spontaneous evolution, nonspecific factors (including placebo), and active treatment factors. These should be differentiated to have a reliable estimation of the impact of different treatment modalities before we can asses treatment-resistant depression or before we can ascertain the (non)efficacy of treatments for treatment-resistant depression.The impact and burden of major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression are immense and go far beyond their economic cost. It is often forgotten that both are not only associated with increased suicidality but also with nonsuicidal mortality and that both can even result in requests for assisted dying. The caregiver burden and associated stigma are also too often overlooked despite that it has been suggested that they do influence (treatment) outcome.",

      "abstract": "A seizure (from the Latin sacire, \"to take possession of\") is a transient occurrence of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal brain activity can have various manifestations, ranging from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena not readily discernible by an observer. Although a variety of factors influence the incidence and prevalence of seizures, ~5-10% of the population will have at least one seizure, with the highest incidence occurring in early childhood and late adulthood. The meaning of the term seizure needs to be carefully distinguished from that of epilepsy. Epilepsy describes a condition in which a person has a risk of recurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizure, or recurrent seizures due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have epilepsy (although a single seizure associated with particular clinical or electroencephalographic features may establish the diagnosis of epilepsy). Epilepsy refers to a clinical phenomenon rather than a single disease entity, because there are many forms and causes of epilepsy. However, among the many causes of epilepsy there are various epilepsy syndromes in which the clinical and pathologic characteristics are distinctive and suggest a specific underlying etiology. Using the definition of epilepsy as two or more unprovoked seizures, the incidence of epilepsy is ~0.3-0.5% in different populations throughout the world, and the prevalence of epilepsy has been estimated at 5-30 persons per 1000. A standout amongst the most intriguing uses of WSN is wellbeing observing. In this paper we presented a checking framework dependent on WSN for discovery of epilepsy seizures. This framework can be utilized for patients living in a clinical situation or at their home,where they do just their every day schedule. I.",

      "title": "Managing drug-induced psychosis",
      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

The actions are generally closer in nature to addictive disorders, being ego syntonic, and less like true impulsive disorders which patients may try to resist [1]. Punding represents a need to perform senseless activities repeatedly, such as folding and refolding clothes in a drawer for hours at a time, polishing pennies, or pulling weeds from a lawn or threads from a rug. The more common ICDs include gambling disorder, compulsive sexual disorder, consumerism, and hobbyism, but may include strikingly unusual activities that are extraordinarily narrow in their focus. The DDS seems to be a form of drug addictive behavior, similar to that of the usual addictive drugs.",

      "title": "A CONTRIBUTION TO THE NOSOLOGY OF THE IMPULSE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "We have presented certain clinical pictures typified by a disorder of impulse. This disorder may express itself in a rather specific symptomatic disturbance appearing as an impulse neurosis, a perversion, or a catathymic crisis. On the other hand, the disturbance may be more diffuse and nonspecific, pervading the total personality and behavior of the individual, expressing itself in a character disorder. In the impulsive character disorder we sometimes find evidence of a relationship to organic factors. However, there is another large group belonging to the impulsive character disorders which does not show such evidence of organicity and yet is characterized by the same infantile, explosive, impulsive behavior seen in the former. In surveying the genetic and dynamic factor, it is apparent that no one factor in and of itself determines the development of an impulse disorder. Constitutional factors, early developmental experiences, present-day forces and stresses impinging upon the individual contribute to the efficacy of the control apparatus or to the strength of drive. Constitutionally, varying drive and control potentials, physiologically as well as psychologically, interweave with early developmental experiences. Among the latter are psychological ones such as oral traumata possibly leading to an intolerance of frustration with demands for immediate gratification. Interference with speech-action relationships may result in the latter persisting as the medium of communication, thus leading to a tendency toward acting out. Physiologically, illness and physical traumata may increase the strength of the drives or weaken the control apparatus. The constitutional and early developmental experiences may lend a quality of impulsivity to the character, which in the face of current forces and stresses may result in impulsive behavior. Specific early experiences may supply the clinical clothing which envelopes the impulse skeleton leading to either direct or distorted expression of a given early impulse. The result is a wide array of clinical syndromes, which have as their common denominator an impulse disorder.",

      "title": "Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy Type 1",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1(EPM1) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by onset from age six to 15 years, stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, and tonic-clonic epileptic seizures. Some years after the onset, ataxia, incoordination, intentional tremor, and dysarthria develop. Individuals with EPM1 are cognitively mostly within the normal range, but show emotional lability and depression. The epileptic seizures are usually well controlled by antiseizure medications, but the myoclonic jerks are progressive, action activated, and treatment resistant, and can be severely disabling. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of EPM1 is established in a proband with suggestive findings and either biallelic abnormal CCC-CGC-CCC-GCG dodecamer repeat expansions in CSTB or compound heterozygosity for a CSTB dodecamer repeat expansion and a CSTB sequence variant (i.e., single-nucleotide variant or indel) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Symptomatic pharmacologic and rehabilitative management, including psychosocial support, are the mainstay of care; valproic acid, the first drug of choice, diminishes myoclonus and the frequency of generalized seizures; clonazepam, approved by FDA for the treatment of myoclonic seizures, is an add-on therapy; high-dose piracetam is used to treat myoclonus; levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and perampanel appear to be effective for both myoclonus and generalized seizures. Topiramate and zonisamide may also be used as add-on therapy. Surveillance: Lifelong clinical follow up including evaluation of drug treatment and rehabilitation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Phenytoin aggravates neurologic symptoms or even accelerates cerebellar degeneration; sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine), GABAergic drugs (tiagabine, vigabatrin), and gabapentin and pregabalin may aggravate myoclonus and myoclonic seizures. Genetic counseling EPM1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once both CSTB pathogenic variants in a family are known, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Paranoid experiences occur along a continuum in the adolescent and can be transient, and many respond to psychological approaches. By contrast, schizophrenia, a serious psychiatric disorder, that involves multi-system disturbances of perception, thinking, volition and cognition, is extremely rare before the age of ten. However, the incidence rises steadily through adolescence to reach a peak in early adult life to become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Childhood and adolescent-onset schizophrenia share many characteristics with the later onset forms, but are more severe with early neurodevelopment abnormalities and a poorer response to treatment.",

These results seem consistent with these mechanisms of pain-depression comorbidity; (1) a trait of susceptibility to both dysphoric physical symptoms (including pain) and psychological symptoms (including depression), and a state of somatosensory amplification in which psychological distress amplifies dysphoric physical sensations (including pain); (2) psychological illness and behavioural dysfunction being interrelated features of a maladaptive response to pain evident early in the natural history of the condition, and often resolving during an early recovery phase; (3) pain constituting a significant physical and psychological stressor that may induce or exacerbate psychological distress. Thus, pain and psychological illness should be viewed as having reciprocal psychological and behavioural effects involving both processes of illness expression and adaption, as well as pain having specific effects on emotional state and behavioural function.",

      "abstract": "#### The bottom line\n\nDelusional infestation (previously also known as delusional parasitosis or Ekbom’s syndrome) is a rare disorder, but it commonly poses disproportionate practical problems to healthcare systems.1 It is characterised by a patient’s fixed belief that his or her skin, body, or immediate environment is infested by small, living (or less often inanimate) pathogens despite the lack of any medical evidence for this.1 Delusional infestation is neither a single disease nor a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia in Late Life: Findings Challenge Traditional Concepts",
      "abstract": "Two notions about schizophrenia have persisted: (1) it is characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and (2) it has a progressively deteriorating course. Recent studies focusing on early-adulthood- and middle-age-onset schizophrenia challenge these views. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia and middle-age-onset schizophrenia (MAOS) are similar in terms of family history of schizophrenia, presence of minor physical anomalies, early childhood maladjustment, severity of positive symptoms, presence of gross structural abnormalities on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, overall pattern of neuropsychologic deficits, and qualitative response to neuroleptic medications. Differences include a higher proportion of women among MAOS patients, and the tendency for MAOS patients to have less severe negative symptoms, better neuropsychologic performance (particularly in learning and abstraction/cognitive flexibility), and possibly larger thalamic volume and to respond to lower doses of neuroleptic medications. While onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in very late life may reflect an acquired condition that is not \"true schizophrenia,\" and that may be labeled \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,\" findings suggest that true schizophrenia can arise after early adulthood. Middle-age-onset schizophrenia is predominantly neurodevelopmental, but it is also a distinct neurobiological subtype of schizophrenia. Our studies also demonstrate that neuropsychologic functioning remains stable in chronic schizophrenia outpatients, even when observed over several years and in the presence of significant fluctuations in the severity of clinical symptoms.",

      "title": "Amnesia and the Amnestic Syndrome",
      "abstract": "A close relationship seems to exist both clinically and psychopathologically between impairment of consciousness and its consequence in memory function-circumscribed amnesia-and the amnestic or Korsakow syndrome. In many cases an amnestic syndrome develops out of conditions of loss or impairment of consciousness or it initiates a clinical course which leads to impairment or loss of consciousness and eventually even to death. Although in such cases the amnestic syndrome is usually of short duration, numerically they seem to be more frequent than the chronic symptomatologically unchanging cases which one sees in alcoholics and seniles. Psychopathologically amnesia represents an unselective loss of memory for a limited period of time, due to lack or impairment of perceptual awareness. The amnestic syndrome on the other hand represents a selective type of memory dysfunction whereby recent personal memories cannot be recalled. It seems to be due to impairment of an integrative function other than perceptual awareness namely awareness of the personal meaning of events which is necessary for the registration of events as personal experiences available for future recall. Intact perceptual awareness is an essential pre-requisite for awareness of personal meaning but the latter is also dependent on the emotional charge of the situation. Consequently lesions and processes involving those structures of the brain functionally responsible for perceptual awareness and/or for emotional functions may be expected to lead to an amnestic syndrome. This is born out by neuropathological findings which demonstrate pathological changes in the hypothalamus in cases with impairment of consciousness and in the mammillary bodies with Korsakow's syndrome. The mammillary bodies form part of the activating system responsible for conscious perceptual awareness as well as of Papez' harmonious mechanism of the emotions.",

      "title": "Depression and Cardiac Risk",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder among American adults, with lifetime prevalence rates of up to 25% in women and 12% in men, and point prevalence rates of 6% in women and 3% in men.1 These gender differences are relatively constant over adulthood, although there is evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increasing and the age of first onset is decreasing. Major depressive disorder is even more common among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with estimates ranging from 16% to 27%, and an additional 20% to 30% of cardiac patients with minor depression (mDD) or elevated depressive symptoms.2 Major depressive disorder is best diagnosed by a psychiatric interview. To meet criteria for MDD, a patient must report sad or “depressed” mood or a significant loss of interest in all or most things that were previously considered enjoyable for a minimum of 2 weeks, and at least an additional 4 (or 3, if both dysphoric mood and loss of pleasure are present) of the following symptoms: significant weight loss or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, decreased concentration or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Minor depression (mDD) is not yet an official psychiatric diagnosis, but rather is a clinical syndrome often used for research purposes. Its features are similar to MDD, but with fewer depressive symptoms and less impairment. An episode of mDD involves either a sad or depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and a total of at least 2 but less than 5 additional depressive symptoms. Dysthymia is marked by a chronically depressed mood state for at least 2 years. At least 2 additional depressive symptoms are present without meeting criteria for MDD. Self-report instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Zung Depression Scale, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) can also reliably assess depressive symptoms, although questionnaires cannot diagnose MDD and should not be considered a substitute for clinical interviews for diagnostic purposes. In this issue of the journal, Todaro and colleagues report that more than 20% of patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) met criteria for a current depressive disorder, including 9.1% for MDD, 6.4% for mDD, and 5.5% for dysthmia. These figures may be somewhat lower than expected, based on previous reports.2 However, the lower estimates may be attributable to the relatively small sample size, selective enrollment (only 82% of eligible CR participants agreed to undergo the psychiatric assessment), and use of an unfamiliar instrument, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, for the diagnosis and severity rating of depression. In addition, it is possible that patients who are referred for CR—and more importantly, follow through with the referral—may not be representative of the general cardiac population. Indeed it has been shown that patients with depression are less likely to adhere to prescribed medical therapies, including participation in CR services.3 More striking, however, was the prevalence of depression among female patients, with 43% of female CR participants meeting criteria for depressive disorder during their lifetimes compared with only 19% among males. Furthermore, almost 29% of women in the study met criteria for a current depressive disorder compared with only 9% of men. These are sobering figures and are significant for a number of important reasons: depression takes a devastating toll on patients' quality of life; adversely affects marital and social relations; results in increased use of social and medical services; is associated with more days in bed or days away from normal activities; and is responsible for enormous financial costs for treatment, lost productivity, and absenteeism from work. In addition, there is mounting evidence that depression is associated with worse prognosis, with a 2- to 5-fold increase in relative risk in patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction (MI),4 congestive heart failure,5 and post—coronary artery bypass surgery.6 Moreover, mDD, dysthymia, and even subclinical depression as measured by elevated scores on self-report instruments such as BDI and CES-D scales are associated with increased risk.2 Thus, not only recognizing depression but also successfully treating it has become a priority. Several recent studies have assessed the extent to which depression can be successfully treated in cardiac populations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely considered to be safe for patients with CHD. For example, the SADHART study showed that sertraline did not adversely affect cardiac function and was safe for most patients.7 While non-significant or modest reductions in depressive symptoms were noted in the sample as a whole, evidence suggested that treatment was effective for patients with recurrent or more severe depression. There is also great interest in nonpharmacological approaches to treatment. Behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy all have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression in healthy, depressed populations without CHD. In addition, the ENRICHD trial recently showed that similar to antidepressant medication, CBT is modestly effective in reducing depression in acute post-MI patients.8 Evidence suggests that exercise therapy also may be an effective treatment for depression,9 and exercise after an acute MI has recently been reported to be associated with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with MDD,10 suggesting that exercise is a promising intervention for patients with CHD and depression. It remains to be seen whether treating depression may reduce risk of adverse events in depressed CHD patients. Although the ENRICHD trial failed to demonstrate that reducing depression improved survival, antidepressant use was actually associated with better clinical outcomes, independent of the effects on depression. Additional randomized controlled trials need to be undertaken with cardiac patients who are depressed to examine efficacy for psychosocial and “hard” clinical endpoints. It should be noted that because of improvements in the surgical and medical management of patients, it is possible that treating depression may not reduce significantly the risk of death or reinfarction over and above standard risk factors such as CHD severity and the presence of medical cormorbidities. Nevertheless, depression remains a highly prevalent and insidious comorbid condition in cardiac patients and needs to be recognized and treated, if not to prolong life then certainly to enhance patients' quality of life.",

The impact of stalking on victims is enormous - many develop post-traumatic stress disorder, contemplate suicide and suffer immense disruption to their lives. A sizeable portion of stalking victims are subjected to physical and/or sexual assault. Anti-stalking laws are usually ineffective against erotomanic stalkers, but may be more effective in deterring non-disordered stalkers. The efficacy of treatment for mentally disordered stalkers is mixed - in some cases the illness resolves completely while in others it persists unabated, often for decades.",

Although some contradictory results exist, the majority of studies demonstrate that depressed patients experience more stressful events in the months that precede the onset of their disorder than do normal controls or schizophrenics. In calculating relative risk figures, it seems that depressive risk is increased by a factor of about 5 or 6 for the six months after an event. Certain events, such as undesirable, loss, or severely threatening events, are particularly likely to precede a depression. These results suggest that stressful events can bring about depressive episodes, but most of the evidence that supports this conclusion emanates from retrospective studies, and corroborating prospective studies are definitely needed. Furthermore, not all depressives report precipitating events, so other causal factors are also operative.",

A paroxysmal extreme varied EEG abnormality often continued for several to several ten sec immediately before a tonic phase, associated with some clinical symptoms. EEG patterns of the “preconvulsive phase” were divided into six types with different clinical features. In most all cases of bamegride activation, poly-spike and wave discharges preceded on seizure activities and some of them related with absence or psychomotor epilepsies. In all cases of sleep activation and photic stimulation, high voltage slow bursts or poly spikes preceded. Seizure patterns recorded at awake-rest were indefinite. A few cases didn't show any preconvulsive EEG changes, and were closely related with grand mal epilepsies. While the grand mal seizure during sleep had a long tonic-clonic convulsive phase and a short pre- and postconvulsive phase, that induced by bemegride activation showed the opposite findings. The grand mal seizure at awake-rest had the middle tendency between the two. The differences among the effects of various recording conditions on seizure patterns present some suggestions as to the patho-physiological mechanism of epileptic seizures.",

      "title": "The “Good Enough” Mood Stabilizer: A Review of the Clinical Evidence",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing family of medications is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. These medications fall into two broad categories according to likely mechanisms of action. Within the categories, specific drugs may vary in their efficacy for different phases of the disorder. The first category, including lithium, anticonvulsants, and some novel treatments, appears to have mechanisms related to intracellular second messengers. These medications have more pronounced antimanic than antidepressant effects, except for lamotrigine, which has antidepressant effects without precipitating mania. The second group of mood stabilizers is the atypical antipsychotics, which act through dopamine and other monoamines. Olanzapine and in all likelihood other drugs in the class possess marked, acute antimanic properties and possible antidepressant properties, but require further study before they can be used as routine options in long-term care. It is clear that the advent of multiple mood stabilizer candidates has not yet led to a single ideal therapy for bipolar disorder, but rather to options that can be flexibly tailored to the lifetime needs of individual patients, in sequences or combinations, and perhaps in conjunction with other classes of psychotropics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Onset of genetically determined neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to specify because of their insidious and slowly progressive nature. This is especially true for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) because of varying affection of many parts of the nervous system and huge variability of symptoms. We investigated early symptoms in 287 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and calculated the influence of CAG repeat length on age of onset depending on (1) the definition of disease onset, (2) people defining onset, and (3) duration of symptoms. Gait difficulty was the initial symptom in two‐thirds of patients. Double vision, dysarthria, impaired hand writing, and episodic vertigo preceded ataxia in 4% of patients, respectively. Frequency of other early symptoms did not differ from controls and was regarded unspecific. Data about disease onset varied between patients and relatives for 1 year or more in 44% of cases. Influence of repeat length on age of onset was maximum when onset was defined as beginning of permanent gait disturbance and cases with symptoms for more than 10 years were excluded. Under these conditions, CAG repeat length determined 64% of onset variability in SCA1, 67% in SCA2, 46% in SCA3, and 41% in SCA6 demonstrating substantial influence of nonrepeat factors on disease onset in all SCA subtypes. Identification of these factors is of interest as potential targets for disease modifying compounds. In this respect, recognition of early symptoms that develop before onset of ataxia is mandatory to determine the shift from presymptomatic to affected status in SCA. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",

Their thoughts can be scattered and require significant effort to organize, often resulting in sentences that do not come out as intended, making little sense to others. Methods : Two Patients with psychasthenia are unable to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature and have insufficient control over their conscious thinking and memory, sometimes wandering aimlessly and/or forgetting what they were doing. Results : The constant mental effort induces physiological fatigue, which worsens the condition. Nevertheless, psychasthenia has become a forgotten disorder. We observed two cases that are worthy of the original definition of psychasthenia. Conclusions : It can be concluded that patients with psychasthenia complain of sinking because of a reduction in psychological tension or an effort to recover the reduction in tension.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

The symptoms can be divided into positive and negative ones, depending on the increase or decrease in patient’s normal functioning. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and confusion of thought, and patients showing these symptoms generally react well to (clinical) treatment. Negative symptoms, on the other hand, include social and emotional dullness, deprived speech, decreased expressiveness, and avolition, and the treatment of such patients seems to be less effective. Language production and reception impairments are one of the main clinical and diagnostic features of schizophrenia. The impairments include speech deficits caused by cognitive dissociation, as well as deficits in lexical-semantic processing. The speech deficits, depending on the severity, are manifested as unrelated sentences or as errors of a higher discourse level, as well as repetitions of particular linguistic elements, rendering the speech unintelligible. Furthermore, previous research has shown that patients suffering from schizophrenia achieve less successful results in numerous lexical-semantic tasks compared to a control group, with these deviations being most evident in the production of atypical or unrelated lexical units belonging to specific semantic categories. This study aimed to examine the differences in production and reception of lexical-semantic categories in schizophrenia patients. Lexical-semantic processing implies the occurrence of certain semantic relations in the mental lexicon. The study included ten patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and a control group of ten participants. The study included two types of language tasks; the first one aimed at language production, and the second one aimed at language reception of lexical-semantic categories. The hypotheses claimed that patients with schizophrenia would obtain lower results on both tasks compared to the control group, and that patients with schizophrenia would obtain better results in the tasks aimed at language reception, that the tasks aimed at language production. Since recent studies have shown that schizophrenia causes a disorganization in the lexical-semantic system compared to the healthy subjects, it is claimed that the lexical-semantic system is disrupted, partially, due to the deficits in the language category-organization. The obtained results are interpreted in line with the most recent psycholinguistics theories.

      "title": "Absence status epilepsy: Delineation of a distinct idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome",
      "abstract": "Summary Purpose : Absence status epilepticus (AS) is a prolonged, generalized, and nonconvulsive seizure that may occur in various circumstances. We report a series of patients in whom recurrent, unprovoked, typical AS was the main clinical feature. Method : We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients referred to our epileptic centers, on the following criteria: (1) recurrent, unprovoked episodes of typical AS representing the unique or the predominant seizure type, (2) at least one episode of AS recorded by video‐EEG or by EEG only, and (3) clinical and EEG features fulfilling the criteria of idiopathic epilepsy. We excluded patients with situation‐related AS. Results : We found 11 such cases (5F, 6M). The onset of AS was after puberty or in early adulthood in most; no clear triggering factor could account for the recurrence of AS episodes; infrequent generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and, rarely, absences, could also occur. These patients had no family history of epilepsy, normal neurological evaluation, normal neuroimaging, interictal EEG showing generalized spike‐ and polyspike‐wave discharges on a normal background, no photoparoxysmal response, variable response of AS to intravenous benzodiazepines, and usually good seizure control with valproate. This peculiar condition was misdiagnosed in most because of the unusual clinical presentation and of some atypical interictal EEG findings, often leading to the use of inappropriate drugs. Conclusion : Although there is some overlap with previously described epilepsy syndromes, specific and shared features point to the existence of a distinct epilepsy entity that we propose to name “absence status epilepsy.” This syndrome expands the spectrum of idiopathic generalized epilepsies.",

First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse. Autopsy Findings.—Negative except for petechial hemorrhages into the tissues, and transformation of the fatty bone marrow to the erythropoietic state.

If the child responds “yes” to Question 1a and “no” to Question 1b (child reports depression but denies current episode), the interviewer should assess suicide risk (Questions 12a–12d) and then skip to the section on Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). If the child responds “yes” to any part of Question 12, the interviewer should obtain further details and assess the child’s current risk of harm to self or others. It is important to inquire about the specifics of plan, time of occurrence, frequency of such thoughts, details of the attempt, current absence or presence of ideation, and so on, and take appropriate preventive action. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires five “yes” responses to Questions 4–12. At least one symptom must be depressed or irritable mood or loss of interest in usual activities. Also, the symptoms must occur together nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, and interference in functioning must be evident.",

      "abstract": "Estados fundamentales. La locura ma­ niaco-depresiva evoluciona por accesos que sobrevienen, generalmente, al margen de influencias externas. Ello nos conduce a buscar la causa verdadera y profunda de es­ te mal (Leiden) en un estado cronico que persiste incluso fuera de los accesos. Eso resulta sumamente evidente cuando se repi­ ten episodios patologicos frecuentes tras periodos intermedios mas o menos regu­ lares. Pero incluso en aquellos casos que la enfermedad no se manifiesta mas que en al­ gunas ocasiones o una sola vez en la vida, es necesario buscar su raiz en una altera­ cion de la vida animica (Seelenleben) que se ha constituido a lo largo de mucho tiem­ po, o que incluso existe desde la juventud. A primera vista, unicamente parecen cons­ tituir una excepcion los casos en los que el acceso se ha desencadenado por una causa exterior; mas adelante trataremos de mos­ trar por que y en que medida esto solo es una excepcion aparente. Tanto la variabilidad de la frecuencia co­ mo la de los accesos sugieren que la severi­ dad de la alteracion (Veranderung), a la que nosotros consideramos la base de todo el cuadro patologico, oscila entre unos marge­ nes muy amplios. Esto mismo nos ensena el estudio clinico. A lo largo de los tiempos intermedios, la gran mayoria de los enfer­ mos maniaco-depresivos, en especial aque­ llos en los que los accesos son muy raros, no presentan en absoluto ninguna anomalia en relacion al estado de salud, su entorno no se percata casi nunca de algunas particu­ laridades pequenas que, sin llegar a consti­ tuir algo patologico, podrian tener para el experto una cierta relacion con su mal. No obstante, en un gran numero de casos, tanto el profano como el propio enfermo apre­ cian que algunos trastornos muy sutiles del estado general persisten, y que correspon­ den, en la forma de pequenos indices, a las manifestaciones patologicas de la locura maniaco-depresiva (manisch-depressives lrresein). Entre los casi 1.000 casos obser­ vados en Munich, aproximadamente el 37% muestran particularidad cronicas de este genero. A veces, los accesos patologi­ cos claramente individualizados no repre­ sentan otra cosa que la amplificacion de trastornos que han estado presentes a lo lar­ go de toda la vida anterior; por el contrario, ellos muestran lo opuesto solo en contadas ocasiones. Ahora bien, las alteraciones cronicas que hemos mostrado anteriormente, relati­ vas basicamente a singularidades de la vida afectiva, no afectan unicamente a las perso­ nas que sufren accesos maniaco-depresi­ vos. Tal constatacion podria conmover se­ riamente la significacion clinica de dichas alteraciones, de no ser porque la experien­ cia ensena que se las observa de manera particularmente frecuente, bajo la forma de simples particularidades personales, en las familias de enfermos maniaco-depresivos. Incluso aunque no sea siempre asi, dichas relaciones son tan frecuentes que no es po­ sible dudar de su significacion profunda. Todo ello nos conduce a concluir que exis­ ten ciertas constituciones (Veranlagungen) que deben ser consideradas como los pri-",

      "title": "Traumatic Brain Injury in Children: The Psychological Effects of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), results from a force to the head and can cause acute physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms. The majority of concussion symptoms will resolve within a month, but upward of a third of patients will have persistent, chronic symptoms. When these symptoms become chronic and persist beyond 1–3 months, this is termed post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Psychological changes associated with PCS may in part be due to a traumatic event and the injury itself and therefore post-traumatic stress reactions may contribute. In addition, alterations to daily life and alteration of lifestyle as a result of the injury can cause feelings of disconnection which in turn can feed anxiety and depression symptoms. A preinjury diagnosis or history of psychiatric or mood disorder, migraine, or family history of psychiatric illness is one the greatest risk factors for the development of PCS. It is recommended that evaluation of concussion and those with PCS take a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation by psychology, psychiatry, and/or neuropsychology. While most concussions do not require treatment, those with PCS will not likely see the resolution of their physical and psychological symptoms without intervention. Treatment is limited, but cognitive behavioral treatment has shown promise in the management of PCS symptoms. It is important to recognize the role psychology plays in the development and persistence of PCS and to recognize and seek collaborative care when treating these patients.",

      "abstract": "The heterogeneity of clinical syndromes subsumed by diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) is regarded by some as a reason to abandon or modify the criteria. However, heterogeneity may be unavoidable because of the biopsychosocial complexity of depression. MDD may be characterised by complexities that cannot be distilled down to any brief set of diagnostic criteria. Psychiatrists and psychiatric epidemiologists may need to revise their expectations of this diagnosis in order to avoid over-estimating its ability to guide the selection of treatments and prediction of prognosis. An opposing perspective is that of reification, in which the diagnosis is viewed as being more real than it really is. The concept of rheostasis may help to explain some features of this condition, such as why major depressive episodes sometimes seem understandable or even adaptive (e.g. in the context of bereavement) whereas at other times such episodes are inexplicable and maladaptive.",

      "abstract": "Ring (20) chromosome epilepsy syndrome is characterized by highly refractory epilepsy that is often associated with non-pathognomonic, electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. Seizures typically begin during the stage of childhood around the age of 6 years. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is the most common seizure types and is distinguished by a long-lasting, confusional state that is often associated with EEG patterns in the form of prolonged, high-voltage slow waves with occasional spike/sharp components. Patients with this syndrome suffer from intractable seizures with cognitive decline and frequent epileptic episodes. Accompanying features of this rare disorder, such as superficial minor dysmorphic abnormalities if any, mental retardation and behavioral changes are quite variable. Because of the variability in clinical presentation, in particular the lack of clear dysmorphic features, the clinical diagnosis of this disorder can be delayed before being diagnosed genetically. Most patients with this syndrome have chromosomal changes in the form of a mosaic. High levels of mosaicism correlate well with a lower age of onset and severe cognitive impairment. Here, we emphasize the importance of early G-banding chromosomal analysis when patients present with unexplainable severe seizures and repetitive NCSE, even in the absence of any dysmorphic features suggestive of a chromosomal disorder.",

      "title": "Case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency mimicking major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder.

Le SDM constitue une problématique fréquente en expertise, en particulier dans les suites de whiplash ou chez les patients lombalgiques. Il est essentiel de le détecter aussi précocement que possible car sa prise en charge spécifique est alors plus aisée. Si la relation causale avec un accident est assez facile à déterminer durant le premier mois, l’influence potentielle de facteurs post-traumatiques, éventuellement sans rapport avec l’accident, devra être discutée lorsque le SDM se chronicise.",

El TDAH representa actualmente uno de los motivos de consulta psicologica y psicopedagogica mas frecuente, estimandose una incidencia que oscila entre 3 y 5 % de los ninos en edad escolar. Es un sindrome muy complejo con caracteristicas sintomaticas muy amplias y variadas, por este motivo su diagnostico tambien resulta complejo Durante la etapa diagnostica, un aspecto fundamental, es diferenciar la presencia del TDAH de otros trastornos que suelen aparecer de manera asociada; es lo que se denomina comorbilidad. Una cuestion que no debe perderse de vista para entender el problema de la comorbilidad es que tanto el TDAH como la mayoria de los trastornos a los que se asocia no son entidades discretas, sino que se trata de dimensiones conductuales que se distribuyen segun un modelo continuo. El trastorno no representa otra cosa que el extremo de dicho continuo. Los trastornos que aparecen mas frecuentemente asociados al TDAH son: Trastornos de conducta, trastornos de aprendizaje, trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo, trastornos de ansiedad, entre otros. Si atendemos a los diversos sintomas y manifestaciones que se hallan en los ninos con TDAH, llegaremos facilmente a la conclusion de que la forma mas rara de TDAH es la que se exhibe en forma aislada, es decir, limitada a las manifestaciones propias del trastorno. Cuando se atiende a un nino con TDAH, si el diagnostico se limita a dicho trastorno, existen altas probabilidades de que pasemos por alto otros problemas. El presente trabajo busca configurar, a partir de los datos obtenidos, el estado del arte en lo referido a la comorbilidad del TDAH para alcanzar una comprension mas acabada del mismo y contribuir a un diagnostico exhaustivo que considere los distintos factores en juego.",

The prevalence of LD in the general population has been found to be 2–10% and reading disorders are the most frequent subtype. Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurological disorders in childhood with an estimated prevalence in 4–5/1,000. Epilepsy is considered to be idiopathic or cryptogenic in approximately two‐thirds of cases. LD are more common in people with epilepsy than in the general population: about 25% of patients with epilepsy are said to have LD. Various psychosocial, medication‐related, and epilepsy‐related factors may be associated with LD in epilepsy. LD can be either permanent or state‐dependent. Permanent LD are caused by a brain lesion and/or a stable brain dysfunction. In contrast, state‐dependent LD are potentially reversible and treatable; they are caused by epilepsy‐related factors. If allowed to persist for a long period, a state‐dependent LD may become permanent.",

In the present study, a 49-year-old female with schizophrenia since the age of 17 was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease after a detailed examination with PET and cerebrospinal fluid, despite suspicion of organic disease due to progressive forgetfulness, abnormal behavior and delusions. Schizophrenia is not the only disorder in which disorganized behavior is seen. When such a clinical phenomenon develops, other possible causes should be considered.

The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci).

      "abstract": "Research has demonstrated considerable heterogeneity in the longterm course of schizophrenia.In the period preceding the onset of frank psychosis (onset), patients vary relative to the rapidity of onset, the presence or absence of asociality, and the presence or absence of semipsychotic symptoms.Following the onset of psychosis (middle course), patients may suffer from episodic or unremitting psychosis, and may or may not exhibit the deficit syndrome.In late adult life (late course), patients vary relative to the presence or absence of an improvement in psychosis and social capability.The usual approach to the study of putative course subtypes is to define a subtype by a number of features; they may include features of more than one epoch.In addition, the course of psychosis has not been distinguished from enduring personality impairments in these subtypes.Another approach to defining putative course subtypes would be based on dichotomizing patients according to the presence or absence of a particular feature of a single epoch.This second approach has important advantages: the availability of larger study populations and a diminished liability for confounding due to the correlates of features other than those under scrutiny.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can produce various neuropsychiatric impairments and a high susceptibility to adverse effects of psychotropic medications. A 6-year-old boy developed symptoms of ADHD after head trauma at age 30 months. Three different psychostimulants, three tricyclic antidepressants, clonidine, bupropion, fluoxetine, and propranolol were either ineffective or produced adverse effects. Side effects mainly consisted of organic mood syndrome (despite the lack of apparent genetic or organic mood disorder), sympathomimetic intoxication, and sympathomimetic hallucinosis. Buspirone (10 mg q.i.d.) produced significant improvement in impulsivity and hyperactivity, but not in attention deficits. Methamphetamine (5 mg every morning), added to the buspirone, was effective in treating the remaining attentional symptoms. These treatments were readily tolerated, and the child has remained stable for 2 years on buspirone and methamphetamine. The symptoms of mood disorder were present only during stimulant or antidepressant treatment, and therefore the diagnosis of organic mood disorder did not apply. Apart from medication side effects, the child appeared to have an \"organically-based pharmacological vulnerability to mood disorder\" and postinjury ADHD (although comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions might have contributed to the complex clinical picture). This single case study was uncontrolled, did not involve drug withdrawal design, and used clinical observations rather than standardized measures. Further study is needed before buspirone can be viewed as safe or effective for treating TBI, but buspirone may be an attractive alternative for managing certain behavioral problems following brain injury, especially in patients sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic medications.",

To receive this diagnosis, the patient must have onset of illness before age 45 years, have had a chronic course, manifest the presence of characteristic symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, or loose associations during a phase of the illness, and have experienced a downhill social and vocational course; affective disorders and organic brain syndrome must be carefully excluded. The utilization of this \"narrow\" definition has caused a major shift toward increasing the diagnosis of affective disorders and decreasing the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the United States. The etiology of schizophrenia is still uncertain, but recent research has elucidated one subgroup of schizophrenic patients who have subtle indices of neurological damage and a clinical course similar to that found in dementia. Dopamine excess in the mesolimbic system is the predominant inferred cause for the majority of schizophrenia cases, and antipsychotic medications all rely on dopamine receptor blockade for their efficacy. Antipsychotic medications are effective in schizophrenia but are less potent against such negative symptoms as apathy, neglect of personal hygiene, and social withdrawal.",

This compendium reflects an integrated research plan executed over a five year period, employing detailed, standardized phenomenological assessments cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Motor activity studies were controlled and included both subjective and objective measures, aimed at identifying a new approach to defining this clinical subtype as a more pure motor disturbance. This work confirms delirium as a complex neuropsychiatric disorder involving widespread dysfunction of higher cortical centres that includes core disturbances of cognition, higher level thinking and circadian rhythms. Although delirium is characterised as a unitary syndrome, not all symptoms follow the same trajectory over the course of an episode; non-cognitive symptoms are more fluctuating. Attention is characteristically disproportionately impaired, relatively less fluctuating, and a key indicator of delirium. Longer delirium episodes involve more prominence of cognitive symptoms. Delirium symptoms overshadow dementia symptoms whether or not these conditions co-occur. Impaired forward spatial span is especially discriminating between delirium and dementia. Motor activity disturbances are almost invariable in delirium and can distinguish clinical subtypes that are relatively stable over the course of an episode. These motor-defined subtypes have similar cognitive impairment severity but differ for noncognitive symptom expression and prognosis.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

In patients with diagnostics different from depression (dementia, schizophrenia, mania, anxiety disorders), the non suppression level is higher in winter.

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Antidepressants",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

Los pacientes con este diagnóstico se pueden mostrar pesimistas, regularmente negativos, con bajo o nada sentido del humor, muy pasivos, retraídos, muy críticos hacia sí mismos y también hacia los otros. Los pacientes con este trastorno tienen probabilidades de presentar trastornos de ansiedad generalizada, el cual se caracteriza por presentar preocupación excesiva y continua por asuntos que son desproporcionados a lo que realmente se vive, se percibe constantemente un futuro amenazante, esto es difícil de controlar por la persona e interfiriere en su rutina diaria. Muchas veces estos trastornos pueden ser provenientes de otros enfermedades o trastornos, como, por ejemplo, del estrés post traumático que se desarrolla a raíz de haber vivido o presenciado un acontecimiento traumático como lo es una agresión sexual, estos pacientes a lo largo del tiempo no se sienten mejor, sino más bien estresados o asustados después de que la situación traumática haya concluido, en el siguiente caso clínico se presume que la sintomatología ansiosa y depresiva fue desarrollada a raíz de un trastorno de estrés post traumático cronificado.

      "title": "Prevalence and clinical specificity of fatigue symptoms in chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis",
      "abstract": "This article provides a critical review of the psychological and related literature on fatigue resulting in both mental and physical experiences. On one hand, prolonged severe fatigue is a prominent disabling symptom in various diseases of different aetiology – psychiatric (e.g. depression), somatic (e.g. some infections) and neurologic (e.g. multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis). For instance, fatigue is a main symptom of myasthenia that leads to pathological skeletal muscle weakness. Furthermore, 40 to 90 per cent of individuals suffering from multiple sclerosis confirm they have experienced fatigue, which impairs their cognitive functioning. In both multiple sclerosis and myasthenia, fatigue has not only a physical but also a psychological dimension. On the other hand, fatigue can be seen as an isolated set of symptoms of unknown origin called the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The development of the concept, diagnostic criteria and some strategies of coping with CFS are presented. Various somatic disorders, as well as subjective cognitive and emotional complaints, are common and well documented in patients with CFS. The most typical include depression, as well as problems with concentration of attention, decision-making and reasoning in complex situations. However, general intellectual abilities and higher order cognitive skills are intact. Directions for future research are outlined.",

A unilateral lesion of a cerebral hemisphere (e.g. haemorrhagic stroke) will not cause coma unless there is secondary compression of the contralateral hemisphere or brainstem. Coma is a medical emergency, because a comatose patient is at high risk of permanent brain injury or death, caused either by the underlying disorder or the secondary effects of coma. Stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation, and exclusion of hypoglycaemia are the first priorities, before diagnosis is explored further. Clinical assessment together with neuroimaging will usually identify the likely cause or causes. The clinical approach to diagnosis and management of the comatose patient is described in this chapter.",

      "abstract": "Hyperactivity is a symptom that may occur in a number of childhood disorders. Because it may be an extreme form of a normal variant of activity level in normal children, the presence of excessive activity is not diagnostic in itself. The disorder, now called Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADDH), is also defined by exclusion. The diagnosis is reserved for children who are not markedly deficient in social and cognitive development; hence, they do not suffer from a schizophrenic or other psychotic disorder. Mood regulation is not grossly impaired, so that mania is thereby ruled out. This point is important because the concept of childhood hyperactivity used by many divergent groups such as parent organizations or educational institutions probably encompasses a broader range of pathology than the term implies when used by specialists in the field of study for the disorder. This discussion does not apply to hyperactive children with brain damage, mental retardation, seizure disorders or other neurological disorders, but to youngsters without known central nervous system disorders whose intellectual development is within the average range. As the name implies, hyperactive children display, for their age, high levels of motor activity. In addition, they also suffer from attentional deficits and impulsive behavior. However, a picture of a child in constant motion is errone",

      "title": "Could subclinical hypothyroidism cause periodic catatonia with delusional misidentification syndrome?",
      "abstract": "PERIODIC CATATONIA IS a subtype of schizophrenia involving the repetition of two phases: catatonic excitement; and stupor. Delusional misidentification syndrome (DMS) is a relatively rare complex of symptoms that includes Capgras syndrome and Fregoli syndrome. We describe herein a case in which DMS during the course of refractory periodic catatonia improved dramatically with a low-dose thyroid preparation. The patient was a 29-year-old woman whose illness began with catatonic symptoms at 15 years of age. Catatonic periods occurred abruptly approximately once a month and the patient repeatedly exhibited a variety of psychotic symptoms, such as visual hallucinations and delusions. Each episode of excitement lasted 1–2 weeks, and the main symptoms during the remission period were blunted affect and thought disturbance. Auditory hallucinations worsened at 28 years old and she was admitted to Nagasaki University Hospital. No marked abnormalities were identified on electroencephalography or brain magnetic resonance imaging, ruling out organic disease. Although thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was elevated (6.750 µU/mL), levels of T3 and T4 were within normal limits. The patient was sequentially given sufficient doses of risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol, sodium valproate, and so on, but catatonic symptoms remained unimproved. Beginning around 12 months after admission, she exhibited Capgras syndrome, one of the forms of DMS, with respect to her father during catatonic periods. She repeatedly claimed that her father was an impostor and demonstrated extreme aggression and violence toward him. Moreover, DMS was refractory, with symptoms remaining present during remission periods. After 17 months of hospitalization, because it was considered that TSH was elevated and T4 was normal, a state of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) was indicated. Levothyroxine was initiated at 25 µg/day and increased to 75 µg/day for 2 weeks. Surprisingly, no periodic excitement occurred at all from that month onward. Furthermore, DMS improved within 1 week and was not seen again during the catatonic or remission periods. The patient was discharged 4 weeks later, and no exacerbation of catatonic symptoms has been seen in 4 years. Thyroid function has been maintained within the normal range. We are unaware of any reports of a thyroid preparation showing efficacy for DMS with SCH. DMS is often seen in diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction, such as schizophrenia and dementia with Lewy bodies, and cognitive dysfunction has been reported in patients with SCH,1 suggesting that DMS in the present case was essentially cognitive dysfunction with underlying SCH. Levothyroxine has been reported to decrease dopamine levels in cerebrospinal fluid.2 Levothyroxine administration could have improved the cognitive dysfunction resulting from SCH in the present case, and also to have improved the DMS by correcting excessive dopamine levels. The relationship between SCH and psychiatric disorders with cognitive dysfunction should be reconsidered.",

      "title": "007 Mild cognitive impairment",
      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndromic label for people with informant-corroborated memory problems and evidence of memory impairment on formal testing in the absence of more pervasive deficits in cognition and functional abilities. It is often described as a “risk factor” for dementia though this is misleading; patients with the first signs of Alzheimer9s disease (AD) will meet the criteria for MCI and as their illness progresses they will move to more traditional criteria for dementia (eg, DSM). Importantly though, they have not changed or “converted” from one disease to another. The problem with MCI clinically, and hence the reason why all such patients are not simply diagnosed with very mild AD is that as one moves closer to normal performance (ie, not clearly demented), the risk of patients who do not have AD (eg, so-called “worried well”; depression; alternate degenerative or non-degenerative pathology) being captured by the MCI syndrome increases. Furthermore, although the concept of MCI seems straightforward, “absence of dementia” or “intact cognition in domains other than memory” or even “objective evidence of memory impairment” varies according to the methods used to define each criterion. Nevertheless, with longitudinal follow-up to confirm that initial MCI status was due to incipient AD, this syndrome offers a important window to examine the earliest symptomatic stages of the disease. Emerging evidence from such studies have highlighted that incipient (MCI-stage) AD is underpinned by degeneration of an interconnected neural circuit including mesial temporal lobe, diencephalon and posterior cingulate regions—all of which, interestingly, have been implicated in memory processing from focal lesion studies in humans.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment as a diagnostic criterion and treatment target in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Green et al1 mention the ongoing debate on whether cognitive impairment should be part of the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. In the preparatory work for the DSM-5, this impairment was initially proposed for inclusion, yet the final decision was that it requires additional study before being included. I would like to elaborate on this point and on the implications of the inclusion of cognitive impairment as a diagnostic criterion for the treatment of schizophrenia. Despite the fact that cognitive impairment is as prevalent as delusions, hallucinations or thought disorder, is present even before the development of psychosis, and is persistent rather than intermittent, a number of reasons might have contributed to the decision not to include it in the criterion A for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The first reason is that, contrary to the symptoms/signs included in that criterion, which can be elicited and/or observed during a diagnostic interview, cognitive assessment requires the administration of a battery of psychometric tests. This is time consuming and requires specific training and skills that are common in research settings but difficult to apply in daily clinical practice. Moreover, since cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is pervasive rather than test-specific, it is difficult to establish what pattern of dysfunction and what degree of severity should be present to fulfill the criterion. Finally, a cognitive impairment of the magnitude typically manifested in schizophrenia is too common in other mental disorders as well as in the general population to constitute a useful diagnostic criterion per se. Despite these reservations, it is possible that in the next edition of the ICD, and perhaps also the DSM, cognitive impairment will become a criterion rather than an associated feature in the schizophrenia diagnostic category. Indeed, as Green et al point out, knowing something about the level of cognition in a patient would help clinicians and families to anticipate the degree of problems and success in work, school, social functioning, or rehabilitation. Since cognitive impairment is present in several mental disorders2, it will certainly appear as a central dimension in systems such as the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). It is possible that cognitive dysfunction represents the distal manifestation of a variety of brain disorders, from head trauma to brain degenerative diseases to schizophrenia. It may then be similar to pain, nausea and dyspnea, which represent the distal manifestation of many somatic disorders. This brings forward the question of cognitive impairment as a treatment target. Over the last four decades, many investigators and pharmaceutical companies have conducted trials in patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia using constructs of cognitive functioning as the main outcome3. Initially, it was believed that second-generation antipsychotics would be able to ameliorate cognitive impairment but, when it became clear that this was not the case, almost every known neurotransmitter was targeted. Basic science and some clinical data pointed out that dopaminergic, nicotinic and NMDA receptors4-7 might all be a target for pro-cognitive drugs. The basic design of the trials testing pro-cognitive compounds involved the recruitment of symptomatically stable schizophrenia patients and the administration of the pro-cognitive experimental drug or placebo added to an antipsychotic drug for several weeks to a few months. The add-on design was employed because of the belief that psychosis is the primary abnormality in schizophrenia and/or because of concerns that, in the absence of maintenance treatment with antipsychotics, patients would be destabilized, which in turn would worsen their cognitive performance. A few projects produced positive results in the proof of concept phases but negative results in confirmatory trials. A range of methodological limitations has been discussed in an attempt to explain the failure of such trials. Selection of specific outcome measures, length of trial, comorbidities, poor patient's cooperation with testing procedures, large placebo effects, overlap with negative symptoms, were only some of these limitations. It could also be hypothesized that, in the add-on design, dopamine blocking antipsychotics impair performance on cognitive tests8, so that no cognitive improvement can be elicited. Furthermore, if in many individuals cognitive performance is, in fact, independent of psychosis, this may have important ramifications for study design. The most important implication is that the trials should preferably not include dopamine blocking drugs. Moreover, if indeed psychosis is only coincidentally superimposed on cognitive impairment, then the pharmacological intervention should be effective in patients without schizophrenia and in non-mentally ill individuals with low cognitive performance. Hence, new pharmacological agents should be first tried in these individuals, to avoid the confounding effects of other schizophrenic symptoms and of antipsychotic drugs. In sum, until a better understanding emerges, although the future editions of the main diagnostic systems will likely include cognitive impairment as a criterion for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, the possibility that the schizophrenia syndrome represents the coincidental manifestation of several distinct mental abnormalities should not be ignored, with the relevant implications for diagnostic systems as well as for pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments.",

      "title": "Psycho-social correlates of treatment-resistant depression: A Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Depression is a mood disorder characterized majorly by depressed mood, reduced energy and loss of interests in previously pleasurable activities among other symptoms.It is a common mental disorder and a major component of the priority mental, neurological and substance use disorders identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) requiring treatment scale up and which account for about 14% of global burden of disease according to the disability adjusted life years (DALY).Epidemiologically, depression is twice as common in females as it is in men, has a 12-month prevalence of 2-5%, a lifetime prevalence of 10-20% and has an average age of onset of 27 years.In terms of prognosis, the average duration of a depressive episode is six months, but about 25% of patients have episodes that last for more than one year, and about 10-20% develops a chronic unremitting course.However, about 30-50% of patients with depression sometimes fail to respond to these treatment approaches and are described as having 'treatment-resistant depression' (TRD).TRD is defined as failure of at least 2 antidepressant medications, given at the maximum therapeutic dose for 6-8 weeks, taking into account adequate treatment adherence.The study aimed to identify the important psychological and social factors that are associated with treatmentresistant depression.A thorough search for literature was done using Google, Google Scholar and PubMed.A total of 27 articles were identified, but ten articles were excluded because they were focused solely on definition, treatment modalities and biological correlates of treatment-resistant depression, thereby making a total of seventeen articles available for the review.The psychological correlates of TRD are: co-morbid anxiety disorders, personality traits like neuroticism, comorbid personality disorders, suicidality, alcohol and substance misuse, melancholic subtype, longer duration of illness, previous history of partial remission.The social factors that may increase the risk for or be associated with treatment-resistant depression are: history of childhood adversity, old age, female gender, poor interpersonal skills, low socioeconomic status, higher number of stressful events, poor social support, poor quality of life.",

      "title": "Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures",
      "abstract": "Pseudoseizure is an older term for events that appear to be epileptic seizures but, in fact, do not represent the manifestation of abnormal excessive synchronous cortical activity, which defines epileptic seizures. They are not a variation of epilepsy but are of psychiatric origin. Other terms used in the past include hysterical seizures, psychogenic seizures, and others. The most standard current terminology is psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Some advocate other terms such as psychogenic functional spells or psychogenic nonepileptic events, spells, or attacks. These terms reinforce the idea that the events are not epileptic seizures. A retrospective review of a small number of patients over a number of years revealed that dozens of different diagnostic terms were used to describe these events. Though established in use, the term pseudoseizure and others should be regarded as jargon, and the use of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (or alternatively, spells) (PNES) is encouraged for clarity. Distinguishing PNES from epileptic seizures may be difficult at the bedside even to experienced observers. In theory, almost any recurrent behavior may represent epileptic seizures. The evolution of epilepsy monitoring units and the ability to utilize simultaneous video and EEG recordings may be a key to diagnosis. Video electroencephalography (video-EEG) of a typical event showing the absence of epileptiform activity during the spell with a compatible history is regarded as the gold standard for diagnosis. Diagnostic delay of years with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures is common. Treatment of PNES may be difficult, but it is clear that anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are of no benefit. In addition to unnecessary costs and the potential side effects of AEDs for these patients, life-threatening side effects such as respiratory depression may occur if psychogenic nonepileptic status epilepticus is treated with large dosages of benzodiazepines.",

      "abstract": "The major laboratory findings of “Cushing's syndrome” (i.e., hypercqrtisolemia, loss of the normal diurnal cortisol rhythm, increased renal excretion of cortisol and cortisol metabolites, and abnormal resistance to dexamethasone suppression) are common to major depressive disorder. Conversely, a majority of patients with Cushing's syndrome of any cause report neuropsychiatric symptoms, most often changes in mood and cognition. Only the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Cushing's disease have been well documented; they differ from those of major depression in important ways. In Cushing's disease, the depression, if present, is intermittent rather than sustained, and there is weight gain (rather than weight loss), more irritability, and less psychomotor retardation, withdrawal, and hopelessness. Depression, irritability, and loss of libido often occur early in Cushing's disease, sometimes even before patients are aware that they have physical symptoms other than weight gain. The quality of the neuropsychiatric symptoms and their early occurrence in Cushing's disease argue against a nonspecific response (e.g., demoralization) to severe physical illness. After the Cushing's disease is cured, the neuropsychiatric symptoms usually abate, but their resolution does not always parallel the resolution of endocrine symptoms. The pathophysiology of the hypercortisolemia in depression and Cushing's disease seem to reflect abnormalities in different loci (e.g., at or above the hypothalamus in depression and at the pituitary in Cushing's disease).",

When the components of emotionalism are studied separately a wide range is observed and they combine in a more complex and varied way than commonly held stereotyped views suggest.

The report also supports my feeling, however, that this trend often leads one into a confusing area that is neither psychiatric or neurologic. Based on the case report, the evidence to support complex partial epilepsy is much less than satisfactory. The episodes last approximately three hours and as long as 24 hours, rather long for seizures. They are said to have \"aura-like\" phases that last as long as four hours. They are not followed by any confusion, and they are characterized by goal-directed destructive behavior as part of the ictal period. These features are all highly atypical of temporal lobe seizures.

      "abstract": "Adverse events following discontinuation from serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are being reported in the literature with increasing frequency; the frequency and severity of these symptoms appear to vary according to the half-life of the SRI, e.g., the incidence appears higher with the shorter half-life agents than with fluoxetine, which has an extended half-life. Yet, there have been no systematic studies of the phenomenon to date. Therefore, a group of experts convened in Phoenix, Arizona, to develop a clear description or definition of the phenomenon based on these reports. The SRI discontinuation syndrome, referred to as \"withdrawal symptoms\" in many anecdotal case reports, is distinctly different from the classic withdrawal syndrome associated with alcohol and barbiturates. Anti-depressants are not associated with dependence or drug-seeking behavior. SRI discontinuation symptoms tend to be short-lived and self-limiting, but can be troublesome. They may emerge when an SRI is abruptly discontinued, when doses are missed, and less frequently, during dosage reduction. In addition, the symptoms are not attributable to any other cause and can be reversed when the original agent is reinstituted, or one that is pharmacologically similar is substituted. SRI discontinuation symptoms, in most cases, may be minimized by slowly tapering antidepressant therapy, but there have been several case reports where symptoms occurred consistently even through repeated attempts to taper therapy. Physical symptoms include problems with balance, gastrointestinal and flu-like symptoms, and sensory and sleep disturbances. Psychological symptoms include anxiety and/or agitation, crying spells, and irritability. Further analyses of data bases and clinical studies are needed to define this proposed syndrome more clearly.",

Depression, confusion, and thought disorders are frequently associated with the critical symptomatology, and they may suggest other psychiatric diagnoses (schizophrenia, mood disorder, conversion disorder) or a substance abuse. A diencephalic-hypothalamic dysfunction is suspected, even if this composite symptomatology cannot easily be linked to a simple mechanism. The aim of this article is to illustrate problems in differential diagnosis, using a case approach. History, course, and therapeutic intervention in a 21-year-old patient with KLS, associated with a clear psychiatric symptomatology and a critical affective pattern, is reported. Psychiatric correlates of KLS are discussed, including the relationship with affective disorders and the possible emotional impact of the attacks.

The prevalence in male carriers over 50 years is approximately 40%.1 In female carriers (approximately 1 in 260), the prevalence has not been as extensively studied, but may be as low as 8% over age 40.2 We present the case of a 65-year-old female with a 6-year history of bilateral hand tremor. The symptoms slowly progressed. Currently, she has tremor when holding a cup and has mild tremor when writing. She has no other issues with activities of daily living. She has no cognitive complaints, loss of dexterity or coordination, or other tremor localizations. In addition, she describes long-standing unsteadiness when walking. On physical examination, she has bilateral mild postural and moderate intention tremor of both arms. Mild tremor at rest in her left hand is also observed. Tone, power, and reflexes are normal. She has no limb ataxia, rigidity, or bradykinesia. During walking, she has mild reduced arm swing and her tandem gait is slightly unsteady. Her brain MRI shows mild atrophy, predominantly in the cerebellum, with no evidence of middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) sign or corpus callosum splenium hyperintensity. Her father had arm tremor for many years. Her son has Fragile X syndrome. The patient has an FMR1 premutation (97 repeats), and her symptoms are compatible with FXTAS. Since the original description of FXTAS, there have been many reports and series describing phenotypic differences between males and females. In males, FXTAS is usually characterized by progressive tremor and gait ataxia. Other common features are parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, and depression. Cognitive decline is a highly prevalent and disabling symptom. Brain MRI usually shows atrophy of the cerebrum, cerebellar cortex, corpus callosum and pons, and white matter increased T2 signal intensity. The MCP sign (middle cerebellar peduncles hyperintense signal in T2) is observed in approximately 60% of the cases.1, 2, 4 In contrast, in females with FXTAS, tremor is rarely the initial presentation and is usually a later feature (prevalence of tremor range: 12%–75%) and ataxia is typically milder than in males. As in males, the neurophysiological characteristics of tremor in women with FXTAS have not been well studied. In addition, there are few detailed descriptions of the clinical features of tremor in FXTAS. Parkinsonism can be prominent as the disease progresses. Cognitive impairment is less commonly reported and leads to minor disability. Depression is a common feature (approximately 40%), and, interestingly, it was suggested that women with FXTAS show predisposition to psychogenic disorders. In female premutation carriers, primary ovarian dysfunction (20%), sensory loss (45%), chronic pain (26%), thyroid disorders (50%), and fibromyalgia are also common features. MRI studies showed MCP in only 13% of females.1-5 In our patient, the clinical presentation with a slowly progressive intention tremor and mild gait disturbance could potentially lead to the misdiagnosis of essential tremor. The early development of mild ataxia (rather than later onset that may be more common in essential tremor) was a clue to the diagnosis. In her case, the family history of Fragile X syndrome also clearly oriented the diagnosis; however, FXTAS should also be considered in the absence of a family history of mental retardation, autism, or learning disorders.

Making a correct diagnosis can be difficult as patients most often turn for help in the depression phase; they also tend to interpret the hypomania phase as a state of very good mood and increased creativity, not identifying it with the disease. A depressive episode in the course of BPAD is characterised by the frequent coexistence of psychotic symptoms, excessive sleepiness and increased appetite. The first episode of the disease most often occurs at a young age. Apart from the typical symptoms of the depressive syndrome, we often observe accompanying cognitive disorders, which represent a group of symptoms causing significant discomfort and suffering to the patient. They most often intensify with the development of the disease and the number of subsequent episodes. In particular, the effectiveness of attention processes, executive functions and memory is weakened. These deficits have a negative impact on the patients’ day-to-day functioning at school, in the workplace and in society, and severely impair it. The case report presented herein shows the difficulties in diagnosing severe cognitive disorders during a depressive episode in the course of BPAD and the difficulties in differentiating between them and dementia, as well as presents the effects of electroconvulsive therapy.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging Data in Bipolar Disorder: An Updated View",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBD is a prevalent mood disorder, often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric conditions and frequently misdiagnosed (Altamura et al., 2011a).Intense emotional states that occur in BD comprise manic, hypomanic, mixed or depressive episodes.According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, IV th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), BD spectrum ranges from cyclothymia to Bipolar I, Bipolar II Disorder and Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) forms.BD can also be conceptualized as a gradual change in mood scale, which ranges from severe depression to severe mania with an intermediate euthymic state or balanced mood.Dysthymia is a chronic state of mild low mood occurring for a minimum of two years.At the other end of the scale there is hypomania and severe mania.An alternative and broader dimensional approach conceptualizes BD as a continuum, between unipolar depression, schizoaffective disorder (which is considered by some authors a subcategory of BD) and schizophrenia.This theory may be supported from a clinical point of view by the fact that, sometimes, during severe manic, mixed or depressive episodes, bipolar patients experience psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions.It is also supported by the presence of morphometric alterations of frequent observation among major psychoses, such as enlarged ventricles and white matter volume reductions in the left and temporoparietal regions (Czobor et al., 2007).In BD, symptomatic states are frequently associated with poor working functioning and social impairment.Bipolar patients, moreover, have higher suicide rates than the general population and among the highest of psychiatric patients.In a recent study on factors predicting suicide in BD, white race, family history of suicide, and previous cocaine abuse were considered predictive of suicidal behaviour (Cassidy, 2011).Usually BD develops in early adulthood/late teens, with an age of onset ranging from 15 to 50 years (Cassano et al., 2006).International treatment guidelines for BD recommend the use of mood stabilizers -either in monotherapy or in association -as the gold standard in both acute and long-term therapy.The concept of stabilization, in fact, has been stressed as the ultimate objective of the treatment of BD, given the chronic and recurrent nature of the illness, which accounts for its significant levels of impairment and disability (Altamura et al., 2011b).Beyond the www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 264 aforementioned core mood symptoms and clinical features of BD, over the last decade, neurocognitive dysfunction has been stressed as another nuclear dimension of BD and, possibly, a marker of its underlying pathophysiology (Lewandowski et al., 2010).There is accumulating evidence that individuals with BD have neurocognitive impairment that persists even during euthymia: the degree of impairment is more severe in patients with depressive symptoms, with functions associated with processing speed and attentional control being particularly implicated (Chaves et al., 2011;Van der Werf-Eldering et al., 2010).In addition, in older euthimic adults with BD, resting-state corticolimbic dysregulation was related to sustained attention deficits and inhibitory control, which could reflect the cumulative impact of repeated affective episodes upon cerebral metabolism and neurocognitive performance (Brooks et al., 2011).Cognitive impairment in BD is influenced by the severity of illness (Yates et al., 2010).In addition, neuropsychological and imaging studies in BD suggested the presence of cognitive deficits and subtle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in limbic areas that may persist over euthymia.However, other studies are inconsistent with this claim.For example, a recent study did not identify any difference between BD patients and controls in levels of cognition over a two-year period, indicating that BD doesn't have a significant adverse impact on cognition (Delaloye et al., 2011).Neuroimaging has recently gained an important role both in clinical practice and research of psychiatric disorders, including BD. Structural imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have contributed to a deeper understanding of the structural changes in the brain in the context of psychiatric disorders.Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) are techniques which measure changes in response to cognitive demand and/or connectivity between brain regions.As such, these approaches provide an opportunity for investigating the neural bases of behavioural and cognitive impairment in psychiatric populations, including BD. Structural neuroimaging Computed Tomography (CT)In the last two decades, the first important data about neuroanatomic abnormalities in BD were obtained by means of CT.More recently, the widespread use of MRI has brought several advantages over CT, particularly in terms of higher resolution of images of subcortical regions (Steffens, 1998).Although a typical pattern of abnormality has not been identified yet (Supprian, 2004), several brain structures were found to be affected in patients with BD according to imaging studies.CT provides excellent imaging data and rapid image acquisition at relatively low cost, it is widely available and more easily tolerated by patients, remaining the imaging modality of first choice in many clinical situations (Dougherty et al., 2004).CT consists of a series of slices or tomograms.Its measurements are performed at the periphery of the body.The image of each slice is acquired by means of an X-ray source and detectors positioned at 180 degrees on the other side of the body.By spinning the source and the detectors on one plane of the head, data are collected from multiple angles.A computer then processes X-ray attenuation measured from different points and uses specific algorithms to create a structural image within the plane.Ionic and non-ionic intravenous www.intechopen.",

      "title": "Augmented Restless Legs Syndrome with Marked Hyperkinesias and Impulsive‐Compulsive Behaviors",
      "abstract": "RLS is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by a discomfort, primarily in the legs, that compels the afflicted person to move. Augmentation is a paradoxical worsening of RLS symptoms during dopaminergic treatment (earlier onset during the day, shorter latency to symptoms at rest, greater intensity, and/or spread to previously unaffected body parts).1, 2 The phenomenology of augmented RLS is not well documented. We present video documentation of severe augmentation on levodopa (200 mg/day) in a patient with idiopathic RLS, with phenomenology that could be confused with other hyperkinetic movement disorders. The case was further complicated by dopamine agonist (DA)-induced impulsive-compulsive behaviors (ICBs), which worsened during attacks of RLS; acting out these behaviors, in turn, provided transient relief of RLS symptoms. A 51-year-old woman with RLS since her teens (but no other history of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias) was referred for \"choreiform movements not yet diagnosed and RLS.\" Her RLS symptoms were mild initially and controlled with clonazepam. She later took l-dopa/carbidopa 200/50 mg at bedtime. This was very effective, but augmentation developed after 1 year. Symptoms spread to her back and arms, occurred daily, began during the day, and caused major sleep disturbance, prompting her to seek treatment in the emergency department. She had long-standing, but stable, depression, treated with venlafaxine 150 mg/day and trazodone 100 mg at bedtime (doses unchanged for several years). Systems review was otherwise negative and there was no family history of RLS. When first observed by us, she demonstrated a wide range of marked hyperkinetic movements (see Video 1, Segments 1 and 2), which she admitted were largely voluntary owing to \"a generalized feeling of having to move.\" Stretching, tensing, extension, flexion, and rotatory movements of the legs and arms, leg rubbing, and whole-body rocking movements were observed. At times, the limb postures were briefly sustained, giving the appearance of dystonia. Some of the movements (e.g., excessive hand gesturing) superficially resembled chorea. Iron indices (serum ferritin 55 μg/L; normal range: 10–291) and renal and thyroid function were normal. The patient had been taking oral iron supplementation for many years. l-dopa was switched to pramipexole 0.125 mg twice daily (BID), and she was significantly improved 1 week later (see Video 1, Segment 3). When last observed (almost 2 years after her initial presentation to us), RLS symptoms were still relatively well controlled on pramipexole 1 mg BID. She took oxycodone occasionally; gabapentin caused dizziness without benefit. No hyperkinesias were observed, but she experienced breakthrough symptoms every few weeks, lasting 3 or 4 nights, associated with overeating (occurring at night when she was clearly awake and aware), hypersexuality, and problem gambling. She found that responding to the compulsions (e.g., waking her husband in the middle of the night for sex) temporarily relieved her restlessness. Whereas overeating leading to weight gain had been a problem for many years, this behavior, together with the development of hypersexuality and problem gambling, was clearly worse on pramipexole treatment. Because of her compulsive tendencies, regular intake of benzodiazepines and opioids was avoided. Recognition of augmentation in RLS is critical, given that increasing dopaminergic medication dose reduces augmented symptoms only temporarily and may lead to a vicious cycle of escalating augmentation. As was the case in our patient, symptoms may respond to switching from l-dopa to DA or opioid therapy.3 Although gabapentin was not useful in her case, other α-2-δ ligands, such as pregabalin or gabapentin enacarbil, could have been considered as well, given that agents of this class of medication are associated with very low rates of augmentation.4 DA therapy was associated with the development of ICBs. This complication has been increasingly recognized, despite the lower DA doses typically used in RLS compared with treatment in Parkinson's disease.5 Two studies reported 7% and 17% ICB rates in RLS patients treated with dopaminergic medications, with binge eating being the most common ICB.6, 7 The stress of coping with severely augmented RLS symptoms—in a patient with pre-existing vulnerabilities—likely contributed to the worsening of her compulsive behaviors.5 Interestingly, a very high rate (61%) of nocturnal eating was recently reported in RLS patients; the researchers suggested that this phenomenon, like mood and anxiety disorders, could be a nonmotor manifestation of the disease itself, rather than being an adverse effect of dopaminergic treatment.8 The array of hyperkinetic movements manifested by RLS patients during wakefulness has not been comprehensively cataloged. Walters et al. published videos of motor restlessness associated with RLS.9 However, the motor and sensory agitation exhibited by our patient was dramatic, even by comparison with examples of severe augmentation demonstrated in a video supplement on the topic.10 In such cases, the phenomenological distinction from drug-induced akathisia, in which patients experience a \"general feeling of inner restlessness\" (rather than the classic limb discomfort of RLS), may be difficult. Patients with augmented RLS may report a generalized feeling of having to move (as did our patient) and lack of significant relief from movement.3 Venlafaxine has been reported to cause both akathisia and worsening of RLS.11 The present case could be differentiated from akathisia on the basis of the fact that her RLS symptoms escalated to this state, showed diurnal variation, and responded promptly to switching from l-dopa to low-dose DA treatment. However, had her RLS symptoms not improved promptly, we would have considered carefully discontinuing her venlafaxine. (1) Research Project: A. Conception, B. Organization, C.

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

One of the difficulties in studying delirium is that symptoms tend to fluctuate over the course of the day. Pre-existing organic brain disease appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of delirium, and numerous studies have shown a high rate of delirium in patients with cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The cognitive deficits associated with delirium have not been widely studied in a systematic, quantitative fashion. Following resolution of the frank delirium, documented cognitive deficits can be observed, and may persist in a diluted form for a period of months. Residual cognitive deficits may be due to a minimal and persistent confusion or to an underlying brain disorder.",

The animal experimental phenomenon entitled spreading depression of cortical electrical activity (SD) or spreading depression of Leao has been implicated in migraine pathogenesis and may be relevant to transient global amnesia. In experimental animals, SD in the hippocampus causes a temporary functional ablation lasting minutes to hours with full functional recovery. Glutamate, which is present in large amounts in the hippocampus, may experimentally elicit spreading depression, and strong emotional events may possibly liberate glutamate and bring about this reaction in human patients.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Developmental delay can be associated with epilepsy. Epilepsy might be either the cause of the delay of acquisitions (epileptogenic encephalopathy) or only one additional manifestation, the consequence of the underlying neurological pathology (encephalopathy with epilepsy); it is therefore not the only factor responsible for delay. Within the framework of encephalopathies with epilepsy a rigorous diagnosis is necessary with, in particular a cutaneous examination (neuro‐cutaneous syndromes), a precise clinical examination (anoxo‐ischaemic sequelae of the perinatal period), an EEG, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as the search for associated abnomalities (cardiac, renal…). There are also epileptogenic encephalopathies such as age‐related syndromes: Hemiconvulsions‐Hemiplegia‐Epilepsy syndrome; Rasmussen's syndrome; Dravet's syndrome; myoclono‐astatic epilepsy (Doose). Age at onset and type of seizures, as well as ictal and interictal EEG finding provide valuable hints for a specific diagnosis, while other investigation are usually not contributive. Developmental delay and epilepsy are frequently associated. One of the first steps to diagnosis consists in trying to establish the eventual causal role of the epilepsy. Answering this question may prove to be of primary importance for the choice of a therapeutic strategy and/or further etiological investigations.",

      "abstract": "Complementary Therapies in Neurology: An Evidence-Based Approach Edited by Barry S.Oken ISBN 1-84214-200-3 Copyright © 2004 by The Parthenon Publishing Group, LondonDementia is a common age-associated condition increasing in prevalence from about 1% at age 65 to over 50% above age 90. Dementia has many causes, some of which are easily treated (e.g. metabolic disturbances such as thyroid disease), while others have no treatments with a clear disease-modifying effect, such as the primary central nervous system degenerations1. The most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and these will be the only two specific diseases in addition to the non-specific dementia syndrome discussed in this chapter; other dementia syndromes are not discussed because of the lack of specific data relevant to this chapter. The clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease is considered the time point at which there are signs of cognitive dysfunction in at least two domains of cognition (e.g. memory, attention, language, visuospatial function and 'frontal lobe' function) and the cognitive dysfunction is causing problems with daily social or occupational function. Before the cognitive deficits become so problematic, there is a period when the person may have some complaints of memory loss and objective deficits in memory or other cognitive domains but has no change in more than one domain and no change in daily function. This is considered mild cognitive impairment (MCI), although there are a host of other terms for closely related conditions (e.g. age-associated memory impairment). About 50% of people with MCI may go on to develop overt Alzheimer's disease over a 5-year period2. There is also a period even prior to the onset of MCI when there is accumulating pathology in the brain and there is possible subtle cognitive change. While this chapter does not review treatments for this latter class of individuals (basically all middle-aged adults), a significant proportion of the population believes that some dietary supplements may impact aging. A Harris poll of 1010 people in the USA found that 78% of the respondents felt that vitamin supplements would provide some or a great deal of help in generally healthy people in growing old and 58% felt the same way about herbs or herbal products3. There is a high use of dietary supplements including vitamins in the aging population. Even in healthy people over the age of 85 years, 25% take vitamin C supplements, 25% vitamin E supplements and 10% Ginkgo biloba extract4.",

      "title": "An Evaluation of Psychobiologic Factors in the Re-Education Phase of the Kenny Treatment for Infantile Paralysis*",
      "abstract": "In addition to being studied as a function of the neuromuscular system, muscular activity should be studied also as a function of the total organism as embodied in the concept of the personality and its functions. “Mental alienation” is composed of a sensory factor (“loss of mental awareness”) and a motor factor (“mental alienation” in its narrower sense) and is therefore not one but two distinct though related symptoms. From the definitions and descriptions of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” given by Miss Kenny and her associates, it cannot be stated with certainty what roles structural, physiologic and psychobiologic changes play in their production. There are certain aspects of these symptoms which bear a resemblance to well recognized psychobiologic and psychopathologic reactions. “Loss of mental awareness” seems to correspond to psychosensory (proprioceptive) dissociation and “mental alienation” to psychomotor dissociation. Therefore it appears that these symptoms may be explained more satisfactorily on the basis of psychobiologic dissociation than on the basis of “physiologic block” as has been attempted by the group of physicians associated with Miss Kenny. “Muscular incoordination” also described by this group is a natural consequence of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” as well as of pain, spasm and actual paralysis and as such is one of several factors in the production of a series of personality adjustments which may stretch throughout the patient's active life. In the treatment of these symptoms Miss Kenny employs a number of well established psychotherapeutic principles. By means of the Kenny treatment it is to be expected that not only will the chronic physical crippling of infantile paralysis be curbed but that chronic changes in personality functioning also will be interrupted. Careful psychiatric study of case material will prove whether the above concept is essentially near the truth, and to what extent personality factors influence the elaboration and persistence of the symptoms “loss of mental awareness,” “mental alienation” and “muscular incoordination.” Once developed, these symptoms may in turn influence the personality functions of individuals to varying degrees. Finally, this syndrome comprising disturbances in the proprioceptive and motor functions of the personality is not peculiar to infantile paralysis. Rather, it appears to be the psychobiologic reaction to muscular immobilization due to any cause and has as its background not cellular pathology alone but the entire psychobiologic organization of the individual.",

The headache is usually followed by vomiting, either of plain gastric fluids or contents, or of bile, \"bilious vomiting.\" After vomiting, the patient usually feels better, the attack gradually subsides, and there is an interval of freedom from the trouble for a month or two, or it may be for only a week. The term \"intestinal stasis\" was first applied by Lane to a condition in which there is a delay in the onward movement of the intestinal contents, accompanied by symptoms of a neurotic type. Formerly, instead of intestinal stasis we spoke of habitual constipation. In constipation we find occasionally a great number of nervous symptoms — dizziness, lack of concentration of the mind, insomnia, etc. This combination of nervous symptoms and delay in the",

It usually occurs after heavy psychosocial stress or traumatic experience. A transient cerebral ischemic attack (TIA) is an acute episode of temporary and focal loss of cerebral function of vascular origin. TIAs are rapid in onset; symptoms reach their maximal manifestation in fewer than 5 minutes. Manifestations are of variable duration and typically last 2-15 minutes(rarely as long as 24 h). Most TIA durations are less than 1 hour. Of concern is the careful detection of changes in behavior, speech, gait, memory, movement, and vision. TIAs are uncommon in persons younger than 60 years.

With the aid of video-polysomnographic electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) monitoring, sleep-related movements can be directly observed. Movements can be described based on duration, amplitude, periodicity, and most importantly their predilection to disturb sleep or produce other undesirable consequences. Sleep-related movement disorders (SRMD) constitute a class of movements that are simple and usually stereotyped, and are associated with undesirable effects such as impaired sleep quantity or quality, and/or impairment in daytime functioning. Unlike parasomnias, they are not associated with sleep-related mentation and are not goaldirected.

      "title": "The Behavioural Dimension of Brain Disorders-An Area for Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a branch of medicine with a relatively short history. Although mental illness has probably existed throughout the history of mankind, it has received little attention from the medical perspective. Major psychoses have been considered as either spiritual or functional until recently. The functional or organic dichotomy has been the official watershed dividing the disciplines of Neurology and Psychiatry. While Neurology follows the basic medical approach, Psychiatry takes a much broader, and perhaps more diffuse, perspective. During the past few decades, there has been a quantum leap in the volume of basic neuroscientific research. A much better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying most, if not all, psychiatric disorders has led to a revolutionary change in the concept of mental disorders. Most functional or psychogenic problems have now been found to have an 'organic' aetiology. Functional psychiatric disorders are much better perceived as medical disorders leading to disturbances in brain function. Clinical manifestations are disturbances of the integration between mood, perception, and thought processes. The old distinction between diseases as either neurological or psychiatric faces challenges to its validity. It would be over-simplistic to assume that brain disorders will manifest either along the neurological or psychiatric dimension, and be managed with a single approach. In this issue, the significance of a combined neuropsychiatric approach to the assessment and management of brain disorders is highlighted. The article on depressive disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) underscores the prevalent psychiatric co-morbidity in this classical neurological disorder. (1) Discovery of degeneration of the dopaminergic system in this disorder led to the development of an associated treatment. It is well-recognised that PD is readily amenable to pharmacological interventions that bolster dopaminergic transmission. Nevertheless, the focusing of attention on the motor symptoms of PD is associated with a neglect of other important determinants of quality of life, such as depressive disorders and other psychopathology. The report on mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) provides an excellent example of the complex neuropsychiatric manifestations of a rare metabolic brain disease. (2) In MELAS, a combination of neurological and psychiatric symptomatology, and use of sophisticated neuroimaging and laboratory technology are required to make the diagnosis. It is perhaps meaningless to argue about the importance of paying dual attention to the neurological and psychiatric aspects of brain disorders. A more intriguing question may be the need for a division between Psychiatry and Neurology, or more specifically, the distinction between Behavioural Neurology and Neuropsychiatry. …",

A committee consensus approach, including criticism from multinational expert reviewers, was used to revise the diagnostic criteria and update diagnosis and treatment recommendations, based on research results. The terminology was clarified and the diagnostic criteria and management recommendations were revised. A functional bowel disorder (FBD) is diagnosed by characteristic symptoms for at least 12 weeks during the preceding 12 months in the absence of a structural or biochemical explanation. The irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are distinguished by symptom-based diagnostic criteria. Unspecified FBD lacks criteria for the other FBDs. Diagnostic testing is individualized, depending on patient age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is defined as either the FAP syndrome, which requires at least six months of pain with poor relation to gut function and loss of daily activities, or unspecified FAP, which lacks criteria for the FAP syndrome. An organic cause for the pain must be excluded, but aspects of the patient’s pain behavior are of primary importance. Treatment of the FBDs relies upon confident diagnosis, explanation, and reassurance. Diet alteration, drug treatment, and psychotherapy may be beneficial, depending on the symptoms and psychological features.",

Subthreshold mania or hypomania entails fewer than the requisite number of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition symptoms of mania or hypomania, or an insufficient duration of time with which to make a diagnosis of a syndrome of mania or hypomania. Currently, the most reliable epidemiology of prevalence rates were reported in a replication study of 9,282 respondents to the National Comorbidity Survey conducted by Merikangas and colleagues. Those data show there is a lifetime prevalence rate of bipolar I disorder of 1 % and bipolar II disorder of 1.1%. In this study, not otherwise specified was labeled subthreshold bipolar disorder as the illness duration was not long enough or the number of symptoms was not extensive enough to constitute syndromal mania or hypomania. This type had a prevalence rate of 2.4%, for a total lifetime prevalence of ~4.4%. This rate is somewhat higher than has been described in the past, but included the subdivision that researchers believe comprises the bipolar spectrum. There has been much underdiagnosis or lack of diagnostic accuracy of bipolar disorder, with relative overdiagnosis of major depressive disorder, which historically has been well documented. However, in the last 10 years, there has been a substantial increase in the making of diagnoses of bipolar disorder in various clinical settings. One dataset examined ambulatory medical care survey data and found that among adults over an ~10-year period, there was approximately a doubling in the incidence of diagnosing bipolar disorder of any type (Slide 1).",

It is known that misophonic complaints coexist with anxiety disorder and obsessive disorder, but in this case, we will talk about a case whose tactile hallucinations were triggered by misophonia. In our case, the remission of psychotic disorder symptoms with medical treatment and the decrease in misophonic complaints bring to mind the possibility of a connection between these two conditions. The point to be noted is that: In this case, antipsychotic treatment resulted in a reduction in psychotic symptoms, especially tactile hallucinations, but misophonia still persisted even though discomfort has decreased. This shows that misophonia was not a psychotic symptom but might occur as a comorbid condition with psychotic disorders just like anxiety disorders or depression.",

They were followed for 1.6 years to 15 years (mean: 6.8 years) after the initial febrile convulsion. The incidence of subsequent epilepsy (two or more afebrile seizures) was 39%, and 80% of them developed epilepsy within 2 years after the first febrile convulsion. The paroxysmal discharges on EEG recorded prior to or after the first febrile convulsion did not predict the occurrence of later epilepsy. Also under 3 years of age, EEG findings led to the same result. There was no definite evidence that administration of anticonvulsive drugs prevented later epilepsy. Pre-existing neurological abnormality was identified as a risk factor for epilepsy, and was an indication of persistent medication. There is no clear prophylactic procedure against long-lasting attacks. Accordingly, medical therapy can be started when epilepsy has developed. Patients with very severe brain damage who could not move except lying comprised only 6% of all cases, and 69% of the epilepsy patients were well controlled. They showed a good prognosis as compared with children with brain-damage in general with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The psychiatric manifestations in patients with epilepsy, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy, are reviewed. There is substantial agreement on the following points. Temporal lobe epilepsy predisposes to psychotic manifestations, particularly schizophrenic or paranoid hallucinatory psychoses. In an important minority of such cases, approximately one‐third, there is an inverse relation between the severity of the epilepsy and the emergence of psychosis, often with “forced normalization” of the EEG. Laterality effects are important: schizophrenic and paranoid symptomatology is related to dominant temporal limbic dysfunction, and affective psychoses with non‐dominant temporal limbic dysfunction. Furthermore, laterality effects emerge also in relation to depressive neuroses and psychopathy, these being associated with non‐dominant and dominant lesions respectively. Confusional psychoses are generally associated with primarily generalized epilepsy although infrequently they are also encountered in temporal lobe epilepsy. Structural brain damage alone in epilepsy, is not associated with psychosis. RÉSUMÉ On passe en revue les manifestations psychotiques chez des malades épileptiques, notamment chez ceux qui ont une épilepsie du lobe temporal. L'accord est réaliséà peu près sur les points suivants L'épilepsie du lobe temporal prédispose aux manifestations psychotiques et particulièrement aux manifestations schizophréniques et paranoïdes. Dans un tiers des cas environ, il y a une relation inverse entre la sévérité de l‘épilepsie et l'apparition de la psychose qui s'accompagne souvent d'une “normalisation forcée” des tracés. La latéralisation de l'épilepsie est un facteur important: les symptomes schizophréniques et paranoïdes sont en relation avec une dysfonction temporo‐limbique de l'hémisphère dominant et les psychoses affectives avec une dysfonction temporo‐limbique de l'hémisphère nondominant. En outre, la latéralisation est également en relation avec les dépressions névrotiques (hémisphère non dominant) et les psychopathies (hémisphère dominant). Les psychoses confusionnelles sont généralement associées à une épilepsie généralisée primaire, bien qu'on puisse les trouver aussi, mais plus rarement, dans l'épilepsie du lobe temporal. Chez les épileptiques, les lésions cérébrales seules, ne sont pas responsables de psychoses.",

Furthermore, it was often impossible to determine the long-term prognosis of a psychosis from its momentary clinical picture, and it was found that psychoses resembling each other in the initial stages could either remit or result in more or less states of mental deficiency. Eugen Bleuler (2), therefore, replaced Kraepelin's concept of dementia praecox by his concept of a group of ''schizophrenias,'' because ''many diseases that could not be distinguished in their psychopathological appearance from psychoses leading to ''imbecility'' have a good prognosis, as does manic-depressive insanity. A term needed to be devised that would link together the disease forms with like symptomatology, even though some of them end in recovery, others in mental deficiency, and yet others in imbecility'' (p. 47).",

      "title": "Psychosis as a Possible Prodrome of Multiple Sclerosis: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by focal demyelinating lesions that can affect any part of the central nervous system. The highlight of the disease is the wide range of neurological deficits; however, psychiatric manifestations are not uncommon. MS is associated with psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety disorders. This is due to either its disease process or its therapies that have been well documented in the literature. However, the link between psychosis as a prodrome and MS remains understudied and relatively uncommon. Methods We present a 40-year-old gentleman who developed isolated psychiatric manifestations for about 10 years in the form of progressive behavioral changes, social and occupational dysfunction, coupled with persecutory delusions. No personal or family history of mental illnesses. He was diagnosed and treated as a case of schizophrenia by a psychiatrist with multiple antipsychotics with a minimal improvement of his symptoms. Three months before our assessment the patient had a history of difficulty walking associated with urine and fecal incontinence. On examination, he had restricted affect and was easily agitated. Neurological examination revealed hypertonia and hyperreflexia in his left upper and lower limbs with normal power bilaterally. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed multiple non-enhancing characteristic demyelinating lesions with typical shape and distribution. Further work-up was done to confirm the diagnosis of MS and exclude differentials, including a negative autoimmune screen, anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies. Visual evoked potentials documented bilateral severe disturbance in the visual pathway in both eyes, suggesting axonal loss. The patient is a candidate for a disease-modifying therapy for MS. Natalizumab or Ocrelizumab was selected based on his clinical criteria and will be started after proper preparation. Results Psychiatric comorbidities in MS are associated with reduced compliance to disease-modifying therapies and lower quality of life. Studies reported that lesions in the periventricular area in the temporal region may be associated with psychosis, but not as an isolated presentation in patients with MS. Conclusion MS is one of the differentials of psychotic disorder due to a medical condition, and rarely may present with pure psychiatric manifestations preceding any obvious neurological deficits, leading to delay in the diagnosis. Despite being uncommon, a high index of suspicion should be kept in patients with atypical presentations associated with limited response to multiple antipsychotics. This highlights the importance of conducting a thorough physical examination and work-up to exclude an organic pathology, necessitating proper management.",

Despite the experimental work which has been reported on the subject there is little accurate knowledge concerning the essential basis of the phenomena of sleep or concerning the real effects of disturbances of the rhythm of sleep. Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years. There are, however, no actually observed cases recorded in the medical literature which clearly indicate that extended vigils produce either mental disease or death. Normal sleep is disturbed in various organic conditions of the central nervous system, such as encephalitis, meningitis, concussion and dementia paralytica, as well as in the functional psychoses, in manic-depressive psychosis and in schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is common, chronic and disabling. While psychotic features, i.e. delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking, are critical to diagnosis, accompanying cognitive deficits are receiving increasing attention. Such deficits, occurring early in the course of the disease, are incapacitating, perhaps more so than the psychotic features (Harvey et al ., 2003), and have prognostic significance (Fujii and Wylie, 2003). They may be seen in apparently unaffected relatives of people with schizophrenia (Faraone et al ., 1995). In this issue of Brain , Whalley et al . (2004) demonstrate changes in brain responses to cognitive demands in a group of people who are at risk of developing schizophrenia (having two or more first‐ or second‐degree relatives with the disease). Furthermore, a distinctive pattern of brain activation characterizes those in whom the disease may be emerging.\n\nAt‐risk subjects and matched controls underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while silently completing sentences that varied from strongly constrained (e.g. ‘He mailed the letter without a ………’) to weakly constrained (e.g. ‘Rushing out, he forgot to take his………’). Four levels of constraint were used to manipulate task difficulty (higher constraint = easier sentence completion). At‐risk subjects showed abnormal responses to increasing task difficulty in frontal, thalamic and cerebellar regions. None of the subjects met diagnostic criteria for a psychotic illness. Moreover, none were on any medication and none sought treatment or even considered themselves unwell. In a subgroup (40%), detailed questioning elicited evidence of psychotic features, and this was associated with an additional change in parietal cortex.\n\nThese observations, made in individuals at an age when the onset …",

In response, we first discuss the nature of the conditions studied and then comment on each issue. Depression is a condition that is only defined when some symptoms are present; there is no truly asymptomatic depression. Thus, to study the morbidity associated with depression, one must identify persons who are actively depressed. Chronic medical conditions, however, are thought to be ongoing, nonreversible, pathological processes with varying symptom presentation. For such conditions, it makes sense to examine morbidity at any phase of the illness; a study based on only symptomatic cases of hypertension, for example, would not be particularly representative of patients with hypertension.

One might argue that the seven eponymous syndromes of the DSM (Alzheimer's, Asperger's, Creutzfeld-Jakob's, Huntington's, Pick's, Rett's, and Gilles de la Tourette's) require a bit of study before their nature is clarified, but all the others either stem from common English roots (gambling, binge-eating, sleep disorder) or are decipherable from their Greek or Latin origins (trichotillomania: pathological pulling of hair; insomnia: absence of sleep, etc.). Borderline, when used adjectivally, suggests something that is in close proximity to something else. Indeed, in its first uses in psychiatry, borderline designated either (a) a condition that approximated another, already well-established disorder, or (b) a condition that occupied a region in between two rather indistinctly boundaried levels of mental functioning. As we shall see, the borderline of our current BPD is derived from both these usages.",

      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "title": "Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is characterized by clusters of nocturnal motor seizures, which are often stereotyped and brief (5 seconds to 5 minutes). They vary from simple arousals from sleep to dramatic, often bizarre hyperkinetic events with tonic or dystonic features. Affected individuals may experience aura. Retained awareness during seizures is common. A minority of individuals experience daytime seizures. Onset ranges from infancy to adulthood. About 80% of individuals develop ADNFLE in the first two decades of life; mean age of onset is ten years. Clinical neurologic examination is normal and intellect is usually preserved, but reduced intellect, psychiatric comorbidity, or cognitive deficits may occur. Within a family, the manifestations of the disorder may vary considerably. ADNFLE is lifelong but not progressive. As an individual reaches middle age, attacks may become milder and less frequent. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ADNFLE is established in a proband who has suggestive clinical findings combined with a family history that is positive for other affected individuals and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CHRNA4, CHRNB2, CHRNA2, KCNT1, DEPDC5, or CRH on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Carbamazepine is associated with remission in about 70% of individuals, often in relatively low doses. Individuals with ADNFLE associated with the CHRNA4 pathogenic variant p.Ser284Leu are more responsive to zonisamide than carbamazepine. Resistance to AEDs, present in about 30% of affected individuals, requires a trial of all appropriate AEDs. Adjunctive fenofibrate therapy or vagal nerve stimulation may be considered for individuals resistant to AEDs. Surveillance: Reevaluation of EEGs at regular intervals to monitor disease progression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: A medical history from relatives at risk can identify those with ADNFLE so that treatment can be initiated promptly. Pregnancy management: Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling ADNFLE is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with ADNFLE have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown, as the frequency of subtle signs of the disorder in parents has not been thoroughly evaluated and molecular genetic data are insufficient. Penetrance is estimated at 70% and the risk to each offspring of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%; thus, the chance that the offspring will manifest ADNFLE is (50% x 70% =) 35%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible.",

In clinical practice, this definition of epilepsy is usually taken to mean at least two unprovoked seizures more than 24 h apart. The operational definition for special circumstances that do not meet the criteria of two unprovoked attacks has been recommended. In 2014, the ILAE refined the practical definition of epilepsy. With this definition, epilepsy is a disease of the brain with either: (1) at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring more than 24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals past the applicable age of an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome or those who have remained seizure-free for the past 10 years, without seizure medicines for the past 5 years.

      "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression in Patients with Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Depression is the third most common illness among patients with schizophrenia which negatively affects the course of the disease and significantly contributes to the mortality rate, due to increased suicide. Depression, along with negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, is one of the main factors that significantly decreases the quality of life and the disease prognosis in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, depression increases the frequency of exacerbations and readmissions, decreases the quality and duration of remissions and is associated with more frequent substance abuse and an increased economic burden. Data on the prevalence of depression among patients with schizophrenia are contradictory and are associated with a low detection rate of depression in such patients, a lack of clear diagnostic criteria and difficulties in differentiation between extrapyramidal and negative symptoms. The average prevalence of depression that meets the diagnostic criteria of major depressive episodes in patients with schizophrenia is 25% at a specific point, and 60% over the course of a lifetime; the frequency of subsyndromal depression is much higher. It is essential to distinguish between primary (axial syndrome) and secondary depressive symptoms (extrapyramidal symptoms, psychogenic or nosogenic reactions, social factors, etc.) to determine treatment strategies. The published data relating to randomized clinical trials for the development of evidence-based guidelines are limited. Current recommendations are based mainly on the results of small-scale trials and reviews. Certain atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, lurasidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, clozapine) are superior to typical antipsychotics in the reduction of depressive symptoms. Clozapine is effective in the management of patients at risk from suicide. The additional prescription of antidepressants, transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy are not always effective and are only possible following the management of acute psychosis in cases when antipsychotic monotherapy proved to be ineffective.",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

A growing body of evidence suggests this is a biologically distinct subtype of depression.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) includes atypical features as a parenthetical modifier for depressive illness. According to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (\"atypical features\" specifier), the disorder is primarily characterized by 2 or more of the following symptoms as predominant features in patients with major depression or dysthymic disorder: overeating, oversleeping, \"leaden paralysis,\" and interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Patients also show mood reactivity in response to actual or potential positive events. Despite aspects of the disorder resembling a maladaptive, persistent mode of behavior, patients diagnosed with depression with atypical features demonstrate a good response to antidepressant treatment.",

      "title": "Psychopathology in Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Although the majority of epileptics who are well controlled on medication do not show significant evidence of psychopathology, a subset of epileptics have serious psychiatric disturbances. Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

In dysphoric patients the drugs have a broad-spectrum effect not only reducing phobias and rituals but also anxiety-depression, panic, anger, and hostility, all of which are highly intercorrelated, but none yet demonstrated to be the core disturbance. Phobics, but not obsessive-compulsives, have an unusually high dropout rate from treatment when drugs or placebo are given. When antidepressants are stopped, even after 6–8 months, relapse is likely. The drugs do not reduce the liability of many phobics and obsessive-compulsives to have dysphoric episodes over the years. Exposure treatments are more lastingly effective for phobias and for rituals, but do not reduce the liability to later dysphoric episodes.",

Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

Schizophrenia often takes a chronic course and patients exhibit difficulty re-attaining their optimum level even after resolution of clinical symptoms. Disability though is associated with many illnesses, with arguably the disability associated with chronic mental illness and schizophrenia in particular is more difficult to cope up with due to the associated stigma and care burden.

      "abstract": "Mrs. C, age 48, has depression and extreme anxiety. She has tried several antidepressants, but discontinued them because of side effects. What could be causing her medication intolerance? CASE Medication sensitivity Mrs. C, age 48, is admitted to a tertiary care inpatient mood disorder unit for evaluation of severe depression characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, and insomnia. Her initial Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 17-Item (HRSD-17) score is 30, indicating severe depression. Her medications are fluoxetine, 10 mg/d, and diazepam, 0.5 mg/d. Mrs. C describes a 10-month history of depression and extreme anxiety in the context of several psychosocial stressors. Her father recently died and she is having difficulty with the demands of administering her father's estate. She is intensely obsessive and focused on nihilistic themes, her diagnosis, somatic themes, and medications side effects. Her husband confirms our observations. No history or current symptoms of typical compulsions (eg, washing hands or checking doors) are elicited. She has limited insight into her obsessive tendencies. Mrs. C had no psychiatric history before her depressive and obsessive symptoms developed 10 months ago. However, in the past 10 months, she has been hospitalized in a psychiatric facility twice. She also received a series of 8 electroconvulsive therapy treatments, but reported minimal improvement of her depressive symptoms. Mrs. C had a few cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions with a psychotherapist, but she said they didn't help much. Mrs. C has substantial difficulty adhering to medications, even at subtherapeutic doses. She states she is extremely sensitive to all medications. Mrs. C says she develops dizziness, increased anxiety, insomnia, nausea, and other vague reactions whenever she attempts to increase her psychotropics to therapeutic doses. She took sertraline, 10 mg/d, for 4 days, but discontinued it because of unspecified side effects. She then received escitaiopram, 2.5 mg/d, for 10 days, but again stopped it because of vague side effects. She was taking paroxetine, 10 mg/d, for 2 days, but experienced vomiting and discontinued the drug. She tried venlafaxine at a low dose and also discontinued it because of vomiting. Mrs. C stayed on mirtazapine, 22.5 mg/d, for 3 months, but stopped it because of lack of efficacy and she was unwilling to increase the dose. Other unsuccessful trials include citalopram and doxepin. Mrs. C is hesitant to try another medication or increase to therapeutic doses any of the previous medications. How would you treat Mrs. C? a) prescribe a low dose of another antidepressant b) increase the diazepam dose to 10 mg/d c) prescribe lithium or an atypical antipsychotic d) initiate pharmacogenomic testing e) restart CBT The authors' observations Before initiating another treatment, the treatment team considered Mrs. C's pervasive medication intolerance. Her enzymatic activity may be genetically compromised, which could lead to high blood levels of medications and significant side effects when she takes very low doses. Individual variations in response to psychotropics are influenced by genetic factors. (1) Variants in the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes produce enzymes with increased activity, normal activity, reduced activity, or no activity, creating phenotypes of ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, respectively. These genetic variations can affect blood levels of medications that employ these enzymes in their metabolic pathways. (2) Mrs. C could be a poor metabolizer of common CYP450 variant enzymes, which led to her exquisite sensitivity to psychotropics. We felt this was a reasonable hypothesis given her tumultuous 10-month course of psychiatric treatment and multiple failed medication trials. An alternative hypothesis is that Mrs. …",

      "title": "Treating Insomnia Disorder in the Context of Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a commoncondition. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the population experiences some symptom of insomnia, and approximately 5% to 15% of these individuals are likely tomeet criteria for an insomniadisorder.1 Traditionally, insomnia was considered as either a primary disorder or secondary to another medical or psychiatric condition. During the past 2 decades, multiple lines of evidence have converged to support the proposition that insomnia, regardless of concurrent medical and/or psychiatric illness, is an independent disorder and should be treated accordingly.2 Partially in response, insomnia is now formally classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) as a separate disorder, and thediagnosisof insomnia secondary toanother condition was removed. Numerous studies have shown that targeted treatment for insomnia iseffective in thecontextofother conditions. The success of cognitivebehavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)with secondaryor comorbid insomnia strongly suggests that, although insomniamaybe precipitated by psychiatric and/or medical illness, it is likely perpetuated by the same factors that are responsible for primary (chronic) insomnia.2 The application of CBT-I in patients with comorbid insomnia also had one significant and unexpected outcome: treatment gains were evident for the so-called parent disorder. For example, CBT-I in patients with depression led to 29% lower depression ratings vs medication alone.3 Given that numerous studies have found that CBT-I produces significant treatment outcomes in insomnia comorbid with such disorders as depression, chronic pain, and cancer (andoftenwithoutcomes that equal or exceed thenormswith uncomplicated insomnia), the time seems ripe to take stock of such findings within the framework of a proper metaanalysis. The investigation in this issueof JAMAInternalMedicine byWu and colleagues4 does precisely this. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia generally includes several components, such as sleep restriction therapy (aligningsleepopportunitywithsleepability tomaximizesleep efficiency), stimulus control therapy (maximizing the stimulus value of the bed andbedroom for sleep), sleephygiene (alleviatingobviousbarriers to sleep), cognitive therapy (addressingnighttime ruminations,worries, and fears), andsometimes relaxation interventions (reducingphysiologic arousal).5 Prior meta-analyses6 have shown that CBT-I is an efficacious treatment for reducing sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and earlymorning awakenings, aswell as increasing sleep efficiency. Furthermore, comparative meta-analyses7 have shown that CBT-I performs at least as well as pharmacotherapy or even slightly better in the short term, with superior results in the long term. Based on these and other findings, CBT-I has been adopted as a recommended first-line treatment for insomnia by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. ThestudybyWuandcolleagues4examinedavailable clinical trials that evaluated CBT-I for insomnia in the context of other conditions. Studies were found that examined insomnia treatment in the context of substance abuse, renal disease, chronicpain, cancer,depression,posttraumatic stressdisorder,andotherconditions.Overall, this studyfoundthatCBT-I was associatedwith an increased likelihoodof remission from insomnia (odds ratio, 3.28; 95%CI, 2.30-4.68;P < .001). In addition, positive findingswere seen for improvements in sleep efficiencyandoverall sleepquality. Positive findingswere also seen for thecomorbidcondition ingeneral, such thatCBT-I improved noninsomnia outcomes as well. There was a significant interaction: effects on psychiatric comorbid conditions weremore robust thanwere effects for nonpsychiatric comorbidities. Themeta-analysis showed thatnotonlywasCBT-I effective in the faceof comorbid conditions, but theeffectswere relatively large (although slightly smaller thanmight be seen in primary insomnia). The studyhada few limitations that suggest directions for future research. First, the meta-analysis focused on remission and did not summarize outcomes with respect to treatment response. Second, the study couldhaveplacedmore focus on the benefits of CBT-I for the comorbid condition. As noted above, there are several studies in the literature showing that treatment of comorbid insomnia not only improves the insomnia but also improves severity and/or tolerance of symptoms of the comorbid condition (eg, produces treatRelated article page 1461 Research Original Investigation Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Comorbid Insomnia",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

      "abstract": "Observation: We report the case of Mr. T, of Bosnian origin, in a situation of extreme social precarity, who presented with Sharp’s syndrome, discovered two years prior. He was hospitalized repeatedly and over long periods for surgical complications related to his disease. He presented with “problems of adjustment” in the surgery department. We met following nine months of hospitalization, when the patient complained of acute diarrhea with severe aftereffects preventing his release home, and which the surgeons could not explain. The surgeons then asked for the liaison psychiatrist’s opinion regarding a possible psychiatric disorder.\nDiscussion: The questions posed by the surgeons and the patient’s previous history suggested a diagnosis of a painful somatic symptom disorder. The patient had been treated in parallel for depression over the previous five months. Cognitive impairment in this patient could have been linked to the sequelae of an ischemic stroke or a central nervous system disorder.\nSpecific Aspects: This patient had a severe cognitive impairment and was in a socially precarious situation. Furthermore, Sharp’s syndrome is a systemic disease that can present significant psychiatric manifestations, as in Lupus. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to these psychiatric disorders are poorly known, and involve inflammatory, immunological, and infectious mechanisms. In addition, this patient had significant psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Working together, social worker and nephrologist were able to achieve appropriate overall care management of this patient.\nConclusion: Mr. T, suffering from Sharp’s syndrome, presented with a painful somatic symptom disorder. The liaison psychiatrist recommended a multidisciplinary transversal management of the patient.",

      "abstract": "1. Approximately 3% of the population (6 to 7 million persons in the United States) is mentally retarded. Of these, severe mental retardation (IQ 2. The high familial occurrence, the continuously variable phenotype shading into normality, and various genetic studies suggest that most of mild mental retardation represents the left end of the normal IQ distribution curve. Virtually no such cases can be found in the group of the severely retarded, either within or outside the institutions, suggesting that the majority of severe mental retardation represents discontinuous phenotypes due to chromosomal, environmental, mendelian, and multifactorial causes. 3. Some mild mental retardation represents syndromal occurrence (ie, mild PKU, rubella syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome); however, in most cases no anomalies are found, chromosomes are normal, height and head circumference fall within normal limits, and few have neurologic deficits, such as cerebral palsy and/or seizures. In the mildly retarded, personal, emotional and psychosocial problems predominate. The severely retarded are a biologically different group with a high incidence of gross neurologic disturbances, growth failure, abnormal head circumference, single or multiple malformations, and metabolic diseases. 4. The severely retarded are generally infertile, the mild retarded less fertile than average; however, a small minority among the latter contributes a disproportionately large number of retarded offspring to the next generation. 5. Most mental retardation can be evaluated on an outpatient basis for causal, pathogenetic, and prognostic factors. The evaluation can be economic, quick, reliable, painless, and efficient in most instances; however, CNS degenerative diseases may require a brief inpatient stay for biochemical evaluation. By all odds the most informative items in the work-up of the retarded are the (family and past) history and the (physical and neurologic) examination. Metabolic screening is usually not indicated in the malformed, neither are cytogenetic studies in the nonmalformed. 6. All patients with mental retardation deserve a diagnostic/causal evaluation and their families prognostic/genetic counseling. 7. Some 70% of mental retardation in the general population can be attributed to genetic causes. Genetic counseling in severe mental retardation is to prevent recurrence in siblings; in the mildly retarded much greater emphasis is placed on the prevention of retarded offspring.",

Neurochemical, existential, sociogenic, familial, pathological, psychodynamic and behavioural explanations have all been offered as putative reasons for the psychological disorder, which in its various representations (panic disorder, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, phobias, post‐traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorders, etc.) can affect up to 20% of the population on a lifetime basis (1). Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations. Indeed, it is possible to argue that a cognitive impairment is the primary presenting feature of pathological anxiety, with the characteristic syndrome of somatic symptoms as secondary or necessary consequences of such cognitive disorder.",

Although their form of clinical presentation may be similar, their evolution and prognosis are very different. It is very important to detect the possible factors of chronicity in order to make an early intervention and thus to diminish the negative consequences of the disease.We conducted a 2 year prospective study in 48 patients diagnosed with acute psychosis in their first admission. Data was collected on the evolution and follow-up of the patient in the Mental Health Unit and the sociodemographic and clinical factors of the psychotic index episode that could predict a change in the diagnosis during the two years follow-up were analyzed.None of the sociodemographic or clinical variables studied could predict a change in the diagnosis, except for the presence of a control delusion during the index episode. The diagnosis of schizophreniform or not otherwise specified psychotic disorders predicts an evolution towards schizophrenia or affective psychosis while a brief or substance-induced psychotic episode has a better prognosis, with a tendency to maintain the same diagnosis in the 2 years of follow-up.After 2 years of follow-up, an significant number of the patients initially diagnosed of acute psychosis evolved towards a diagnosis of schizophrenia or affective psychosis in a difficult-to-predict way.",

      "title": "Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief",
      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

      "title": "The Myth of Schizophrenia as a Progressive Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia has historically been considered to be a deteriorating disease, a view reinforced by recent MRI findings of progressive brain tissue loss over the early years of illness. On the other hand, the notion that recovery from schizophrenia is possible is increasingly embraced by consumer and family groups. This review critically examines the evidence from longitudinal studies of (1) clinical outcomes, (2) MRI brain volumes, and (3) cognitive functioning. First, the evidence shows that although approximately 25% of people with schizophrenia have a poor long-term outcome, few of these show the incremental loss of function that is characteristic of neurodegenerative illnesses. Second, MRI studies demonstrate subtle developmental abnormalities at first onset of psychosis and then further decreases in brain tissue volumes; however, these latter decreases are explicable by the effects of antipsychotic medication, substance abuse, and other secondary factors. Third, while patients do show cognitive deficits compared with controls, cognitive functioning does not appear to deteriorate over time. The majority of people with schizophrenia have the potential to achieve long-term remission and functional recovery. The fact that some experience deterioration in functioning over time may reflect poor access, or adherence, to treatment, the effects of concurrent conditions, and social and financial impoverishment. Mental health professionals need to join with patients and their families in understanding that schizophrenia is not a malignant disease that inevitably deteriorates over time but rather one from which most people can achieve a substantial degree of recovery.",

      "abstract": "The inference is reached that the depressive syndrome is by no means alien to the schizophrenic psychosis on the ground of detailed clinical follow-up study of 153 psychotic seizures in 71 patients, affected with various forms of schizophrenia. The depressive syndrome occurs in the clinical picture of most of the patients in the course of the disease, and, more particularly in those suffering from periodic form, in which, not infrequently, alternation of maniacal and depressive manifestations is observed. Dysthymia is the initial symptom of the disease very often. It usually occurs as a response type (similar to hypochondriac or depressive â€žreaction`) with production of insanity and other symptoms ensuing. The depressive syndrome is scarcely manifested in its pure form. Most frequently, depressive paranoid syndrome and depressive hypochondriac syndrome are observed with the insanity production being concomitant to hallucinations and eventually, pseudo-hallucinations and other symptoms of the psychic automatism. The schizophrenic dysthymia and the melanocholic insanity of schizophreniacs might display complete simulation of cyclothymia. However, the insanity in schizofpherenia very often assumes a rather generalized, greatly ridiculous and absurd character. Although dysthymia appears to be the initial symptom of the affection rather frequently, the melancholic insanity is usually manifested much later. Neuroletipcs play a supplementary role in terms of increasing the incidence of cases with depressive pictures and intensification of their manifestations. The higher incidence of depressive syndromes in schizophrenia, recently observed, should be accounted for, frist and foremost by the â€žmilder`, more â€žpsychological` and less â€žbiological` manifestation of the disease.",

MDEs are characterized most prominently by mood changes that are manifest as sad, depressed, empty mood, and/or significantly decreased interest or pleasure in all or nearly all usual activities. Depressed individuals frequently report cognitive changes that include impaired attention, concentration, and decision making. Theories regarding a genetic basis for some cases of depressive illness stem from findings of family and twin studies. Cognitive theories of mood disorders have primarily focused on the role that negative cognitions can play in creating a vulnerability to depression and maintaining a depressive state. Anxiety disorders are among the most common comorbid conditions among those with depressive disorders.",

Capgras syndrome was initially considered a purely psychotic disorder, but recently, Capgras syndrome understands as a neurological disorder, in which the delusion primarily results from organic brain lesions or degeneration. The case report aims to review previous literature on topic and present a case of pregnant woman experiencing Capgras delusion under full consciousness and whose expediencies are not linked to any psychiatric or neurological illness. Case presentation: A 29 year old, pregnant woman was brought for psychiatric consultation by her family with chief complaints of belief that her husband had been replaced by identical impostor, associated with irritability, anger and hostility since 4 months and aggravated in the last month. This pregnant woman showing absence of emotional response, no familiarity toward her husband and delusion that her husband replaced by imposter. Conclusion: Capgras syndrome is not necessarily pathological and can occur in a healthy population. Capgras syndrome may happen spontaneously under full consciousness in the healthy subjects; like in neurological and psychiatric patients. In this case report the phenomenological aspects of Capgras syndrome may similar in the content of the delusion to other studies were carried out with psychiatric or neurological patients, but no evidence of depersonalization, physical violence or aggression.",

      "abstract": "Manneristic catatonia, one form of Leonhard's systematic schizophrenias, is illustrated in nine case notes. The essential syndrome of this rare disorder (described by Leonhard in the preneuroleptic era) consisted in mannerisms and progressive stiffness of psychomotor activity. Mannerisms often developed from obsessive and compulsive ideas; whereas distress disappeared, repetitive behavior developed into a stereotype. Complex movements (e.g. not to shake hands; mutism) became mannerisms. With disease progression stiffness of facial expression and gestures and an impairment of voluntary motor activity became increasingly prominent. There were no signs of (neuroleptic-induced) parkinsonism. Manneristic catatonia affects preponderantly men and exhibits an early age of onset (median: 23 years). In none of the cases a family history of psychiatric illness was noted. Severe obstetric and birth complications as well as the high prevalence of supratentorial and cerebellar CT/MR abnormalities in this patient group point to deviations of prenatal brain maturation. The median yearly dose of neuroleptics was 83.1 g chlorpromazin equivalents. The characteristic psychopathology was not essentially influenced by modern psychopharmacological treatment neither in the beginning nor in the long run irrespective of the time of onset of the disease. Continuous high-dose neuroleptic treatment is not efficacious in this distinct group of systematic schizophrenias. Behavioural training in a rehabilitation unit is the treatment of choice from the early beginning.",

      "abstract": "By far, the most common reasons for decline in school performance include anything from psychosocial stressors (divorce, death of a loved one or pet, new school, or bullying) to psychiatric disease (depression). These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "title": "The Neurobiology of Affiliation: Implications for Autism",
      "abstract": "Abstract A decade from now, when we look back at the early years of affective neuroscience, we may wonder about our conspicuous preoccupation with “negative” emotions. Fear and anxiety, sadness and depression, anger and aggression have received considerable attention in the past few years. By contrast, the neurobiology of “positive” affects, such as joy, affiliation, and love, seem almost taboo subjects. No doubt our focus on negative emotions derives from a need to understand psychopathological states. Most major forms of psychopathology, such as the anxiety and affective disorders, involve an excess of one of the negative emotions. Recently, we have begun to appreciate that most mental disorders also involve a loss of positive affect, whether it is the anhedonia of major depressive disorder, the absence of affiliation in autism, or the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. An important first step toward accounting for the loss of positive affects will be to understand their normal expression. Clearly, joy is not just the absence of sadness, and love/affiliation is much more than the absence of hate or fear. Positive affects will undoubtedly have a circuitry and a neurochemistry that is unique from what we have already learned about fear, sadness, and anger. But how can we study these complex affects with the modern tools of neurobiology? In this chapter, I review one approach based on animal studies. This approach demonstrates that current molecular and cellular tools, when combined with comparative, ethologically relevant studies, can reveal some intriguing leads into the neural basis of affiliation in nonhuman animals. Affiliation is an ethological term generally used to describe membership in a conspecific group. In fact, there are two quite different uses of the term affiliation. The first, relevant to all species, is sociality. Some highly affiliative species, including our own, cluster in flocks or herds in which group membership is essential for survival. Other, nonaffiliative species, such as orangutans or certain cats, are loners, living solitary lives except when mating or caring for young. A second use of the term affiliation describes specific aspects of behavior within a species. In this latter sense, affiliative behaviors include side-by-side or huddling behavior, parent-infant attachment, and pair bonding. Because these behaviors are most relevant to understanding the basis of the powerful human experiences of acceptance, attachment, and love, this chapter focuses on this second meaning of affiliation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Alpha‐mannosidosis is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability (ID), moderate to severe neurosensory hearing loss, frequent infections, psychomotor disturbances and skeletal dysmorphism. For the first time, a panel of nine alpha‐mannosidosis patients with psychiatric symptoms is presented. The clinical picture has several similarities: a physical or psychological stressor precedes a rapid development of a state of confusion, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety and often depression leading to a severe loss of function. This usually lasts 3–12 weeks, and is followed by a period of somnolence and asthenia. It may be more prevalent in females. In four of the described patients search for organic causes of the syndrome was performed, but revealed only negative findings. Because of the limited number of cases no firm conclusion about the benefit of various psychotropic drugs can be drawn from our observation. Psychiatric symptoms could affect as many as 25% of patients with alpha‐mannosidosis. First onset is typically in late puberty to early adolescence. The episodes may be recurrent, and of limited duration although medication may be necessary to alleviate symptoms. Our observations indicate that alpha‐mannosidosis is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric symptoms. These should not be dismissed as part of the ID but should give rise to the initiation of adequate diagnostic work‐up, treatment and support.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a multifaceted disorder characterized by multiple motor and at least one vocal tics that start in childhood, persist for at least 1 year, and cannot be attributed to another medical condition or exposure to medications/drugs. Clinical diagnostic criteria are available, and identification of tics is typically straightforward based on characteristic appearance and features. Diagnostic uncertainty can rarely arise in cases of mild tics, atypical features, certain psychiatric comorbidities, and other non-tic movement disorders. Comorbid psychopathology, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive behaviors/obsessive-compulsive disorder, affects the majority of patients and is correlated with disease severity and the presence of additional psychiatric behaviors. The severity of tics often improves after adolescence, whereas psychiatric symptoms typically persist. The subset of patients in whom tics persist into adulthood experience higher rates of anxiety, and lower self-esteem, socioeconomic status, and quality of life; the relative contribution of motor tics and psychopathology is not fully understood. This article summarizes the clinical features of Tourette syndrome, including major diagnostic criteria, unique features of tics, and key aspects that differentiate tics from common mimics and chameleons. Comorbid psychiatric conditions and their impact on phenotype and quality of life are described. Finally, current understanding of the natural history is summarized, including limited research in adults with Tourette syndrome.",

The clinical course and outcome of a persistent vegetative state depend on its cause. Post-traumatic unawareness persisting for more than a month should not be considered an irreversible condition, because an outcome that might be regarded by some as being acceptable is possible even in patients with very severe brain damage. Recovery of consciousness from a posttraumatic persistent vegetative state is unlikely after 12 months in adults and children. For most such patients, life expectancy ranges from 2 to 5 years; survival beyond 10 years is unusual. Corpus callosum and dorsolateral brainstem lesions are highly significant in predicting nonrecovery. Long-term prognosis of post-traumatic vegetative state (VS) remains poorly defined. Essential prognostic factors of VS include threat blink reflex presence, ventricular dilatation, brainstem and corpus callosal injury; motor score (Glasgow Coma Score) and presence of spontaneous eye movements.",

The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

The prevalence of depression in the elderly has attracted extensive research effort and yelded a wide range of estimates, depending on diagnostic criteria, the method of detecting depression, the experience of the interviewers and, most importantly, the characteristics of this population. Major Depression appears to be less common in the elderly than in younger adults, but subsyndromal depression is more prevalent. DSM diagnostic criteria require either depressed mood or loss of interest, but these symptoms appear to be less prominent in the elderly, being anxiety, irritability and physical symptoms more significant indicators of elderly depressive states. Depression in the elderly is essentially heterogeneous and has a multifactorial etiopathogenesis (Fig. 1): this has contributed to its underrecognition, underestimation and undertreatment. The “atypical” clinical presentation of depression in the elderly as somatic symptoms, anxiety, changes in functional ability, loss of capacity to enjoy life or loss of interest in usual activities, can be misleading for the clinician and masks an underlying mood disorder. Even “pseudodementia” is clinically important since it may result in failure to recognize and treat either depression or dementia. Comorbidity with a physical illness such as cardiovascular disease or other psychiatric symptoms (e.g. anxiety) is frequent in late-life depression, and the presence of one or more medical illnesses may influence the diagnosis of depression; moreover, it represents a negative prognostic factor for response to antidepressant therapy. The pharmacological management of depression in late life is complicated by physiological changes associated with aging (Fig. 2), higher sensitivity to develop side-effects, concomitant medical disorders with drug-drug interaction phenomena and compliance problems. These factors need to be carefully taken into account when selecting antidepressants for the treatment of depressive states in the elderly. Antidepressants are as effective in the elderly as they are earlier in life. The development of newer antidepressants has focused on compounds that are better tolerated, with reduced unwanted effects and more likely to be used in long-term treatment. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonergic/Noradrenergic Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI), (e.g. venlafaxine) and Noradrenergic/Serotonergic Specific Antagonist (NaSSA), (e.g.mirtazapine), show a more favourable side-effects profile and appear to be more suitable for the treatment of elderly depression. In selecting the appropriate treatment, the physician should take account of concomitant illnesses and current therapies, choosing an agent with a simple once-daily regimen and a larger pharmacodynamic and therapeutic spectrum (e.g. on depressive and anxiety symptoms). However, a comprehensive management of elderly depressive states should include not only the physician, but also a psychological and psychosocial support, which appears important to explore stressors for depression and to educate patients and their families about depressive illness and its treatment.

      "title": "The psychopathology of schizophrenia: an integrated view on positive symptoms and negative sympto",
      "abstract": "Interest in the distinction between positive and negative symptoms has reached a peak in the last decade and has led to research in different fields like phenomenology, ethiopathogenesis, treatment, course and outcome. Which symptoms are considered positive or negative varies across different authors, although there seems to be agreement on a core syndrome. The definition problems can be also found in the rating scales used for measuring positive and negative symptoms. The positive/negative distinction may represent different manifestations of a common underlying process. It also may suggest the existence of different pathophysiologies in schizophrenia. Since both positive and negative symptoms are frequent in schizophrenia, they are most likely not completely independent. The negative/positive syndrome is not sufficient to describe the dimensions of the complex phenomenology of schizophrenia. Among others, a depressive syndrome needs to be integrated. There is much controversy concerning the course of positive and negative symptoms over time. In subacute and chronic patients the negative syndrome seems to be more stable than the positive syndrome. The differentiation between primary and secondary negative symptoms seems to have great relevance to clinical and research aspects. This differentiation is an important factor in the interpretation of neuroleptic trials on negative symptoms. One way of differentiating between direct and indirect drug effects on negative symptoms is to use sophisticated statistical procedures, for example path analysis.",

      "title": "Diagnosis 2.0 Are Mental Illnesses Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes? A Major Challenge for the DSM-V Committees as They Revise the Diagnostic \"Bible\" of Psychiatric Disorders Is to Determine Whether Mental Illnesses Are Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "abstract": "Aproximately 1% of the population suffers from schizophrenia, a mental disorder that results in devastating consequences for the person who struggles with it. During the last decades, research is showing that schizophrenia is part of a spectrum of aetiologically and phenomenologically related disorders that includes psychotic disorders like delusional disorder, for example, but also nonpsychotic disorders, as it is the case of schizotypal personality disorder, and, probably, schizotypy features as those measured in this thesis. These disorders tend to have their onset in late adolescence and early adulthood, causing a big disruption in the transition to adulthood with tremendous consequences devastating for independent living and functioning. Also, it has been suggested that schizophrenia spectrum disorders represent the most extreme manifestation of a continuum known as schizotypy. It is hypothesized that there is a continuum that ranges from minimal impairment to psychotic illnesses. Thus, schizotypy is a useful construct for studying the aetiology, development and expression of schizophrenia and related disorders, and ultimately, for the identification of individuals at risk for psychotic disorders or the development of preventive treatment interventions, independently of the effects that schizophrenic patients suffer (hospitalization, stigma, etc.). The studies presented in the present dissertation contribute to the research progress and understanding of the psychosis continuum by 1) providing reliable and word-wide used measures of schizotypy in Spanish language, 2) adding further evidence of the multidimensionality of the scales and the cross-cultural validity of this structure, and 3) showing that schizotypy dimensions have the same psychopathological and functional correlates (construct validity) and moderating factors in nonclinical individuals as presented by psychotic patients, a necessary condition to support the continuum hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "At least three types of ictal atomic phenomena can be seen in partial seizures. Focal atomic seizures are partial seizures with ictal paresis or paralysis of one or more body parts preceding or independent of any convulsive activity. A diagnosis may be difficult without simultaneous EEG recording supplemented by video monitoring or polygraphy. Epileptic negative myoclonus manifests as brief lapses in tone in one or more muscle groups that interferes with motor coordination and postural control. Drop attacks can also occur in partial seizures, as have been well documented in patients with temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. Different mechanisms may underlie these three phenomena. Focal atonic seizures probably result from relatively circumscribed seizure activity in one or more cortical areas that contribute to the elaboration and execution of motor functions. Whether this represents inactivation or interference in motor integration, or activation of inhibitory system, remains unresolved. The pathophysiology of epileptic negative myoclonus, like that of its positive counterpart, is probably to be found at a more local level, possibly from transiently enhanced local inhibition in the motor cortex. Drop attacks in partial seizures may be close in mechanism to that also seen in generalized seizures, possibly related to ictal activation of descending inhibitory pathways in the brainstem.",

The most significant abnormality is that which is termed posthypoxic and/or postresuscitation encephalopathies whose nature has not been elucidated particularly at the cellular and molecular levels. It is emphasized that this involves brain abnormalities, which is a sequela of hypoxia or ischemia of systemic origin, rather than primary brain damages. In some patients who have sustained a severe hypoxic episode of any nature and recovered their psychoneurological status ever rapidly and rather fully, there may be an abrupt progressive deterioration of their neurological status in some days or months, which results in death or grave irreversible disability. It is concluded that not only do reparative and compensatory processes occur, but also there are phenomena of progressive degenerative changes in a primarily successfully resuscitated person or experimental animal in the central nervous system in the postresuscitation period. A classification of psychoneurological disorders in patients in the early postresuscitation period has been made and ways of their prevention or alleviation have been indicated.",

      "title": "Are antidepressants effective in cancer patients?",
      "abstract": "Much work has been carried out to evaluate the physical sequelae of cancer, but relatively little research has been carried out into the psychological and psychiatric sequelae. Depression is a significant symptom for many palliative care patients but is under recognised and frequently not treated (1–3). Depression is characterised by persistent low mood (dysphoria) and loss of interest in activities (anhedonia). The clinical diagnosis of depression is made according to criteria, e.g. DSM-IV criteria. Depression is an illness with no distinct biological markers or effective diagnostic test. The physician must rely upon skill and knowledge in differentiating depression from ‘appropriate sadness’ or grief reactions as the end of life approaches (4). Low mood can be seen as a continuous variable in cancer patients. Physicians need to seek symptoms actively and not expect the patient to report them spontaneously. Non-disclosure by the patient may occur for a number of reasons. The cancer patient may already feel stigmatised and the physician may believe that the added label of depression may enhance stigmatisation and, therefore, mental suffering; however, most patients are accepting of treatment (5). Physicians may attribute somatic symptoms of depression to the cancer illness, highlighting their tendency to separate mental from physical health as described by Tucker (6). Block (7) suggested hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, guilt and suicidal ideation as better indicators of depression. The diagnosis of depression relies on clinical judgement. However, poor detection remains a significant problem; Maguire (8) stated that up to 80% of developed psychological morbidity remains unrecognised and untreated. A study in 2004 by Lawrie et al. (9) found that whilst 73% of palliative care physicians routinely assessed for depression, 61% reported difficulties with assessment and management of depression and wanted more training in this area. The treatment of depression can improve quality of life and also the palliation of other symptoms. All patients identified as depressed require psychosocial support. There is considerable interest in the role of counselling for depression. Many patients find the opportunity to talk about their concerns and fears to be helpful and may find this opportunity from their clinical nurse specialist, doctor, paramedical staff and clergy. A recent study suggested that although counselling can be considered appropriate treatment in some cases (10), antidepressants have a faster onset of action and more appropriate for patients with a short life expectancy, i.e. patients with advanced cancer.",

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

The initial clinical description still remains without modifications. However, progress has been made both in understanding its physiopathology and management, and its name has been changed into PDS in the late 1990s. Since the early 2000s, it was also termed frontal-sub-cortical dysfunction syndrome. PDS results from decompensation of postural function, gait and psychomotor automatisms linked to posture and motor programming impairment related to fronto-sub-cortical lesions. PDS is characterized by retropulsion, non-specific gait disorders, neurological signs (including akinesia, reactional hypertonia, and impaired reactive postural responses and protective reactions) and psychological disorders (fear of standing and walking as an acute feature or cognitive processing retardation and anhedonia as a chronic feature). PDS occurrence is linked to three factors implicated in functional reserve impairment due to frontal-sub-cortical structures disturbances: aging, chronic affections (mainly of degenerative or vascular origin), and acute organic or functional factors which induce cerebral blood flow decrease. Multidisciplinary management, including medical motor physiotherapy and psychological approach, is required for patients with PDS care.",

As well as a range of different physical symptoms, multiple sclerosis can also cause a wide variety of mental and emotional disturbances. Psychosis in multiple sclerosis, while not common, does occur in approximately 5% of cases, although it is probably under reported. Neurological changes, alterations in brain chemistry or severe stress such as that brought on by diagnosis or the impact of multiple sclerosis, can lead to the development of psychosis Psychosis may also occur as a result of treatment with steroids or other drugs. The duration and intensity of the psychotic episode can be variable, ranging from mild loss of contact with reality, to severe loss of a grasp on reality, with full delusional episodes; to complete catatonia. We present a case report of a patient diagnosed with Multiple Scleroses that presents psychotic symptoms as early symptomatology of the disease, independently of steroid and other specifically medication.",

      "abstract": "The onset and reversibility of major depression is likely to be explained by diffuse neuromodulatory mechanisms rather than permanent abnormalities of connectivity and neurotransmission. However, the expression of mood state appears to involve fronto-striatal mechanisms. Lesions of the ventral frontal cortex give rise to profound modification of affect and behaviour not explained by effects on current intellectual function. These may represent the most extreme possible disturbances of emotional experience. Neuropsychological testing in major depression shows evidence of slowing in motor and cognitive domains with additional prominent effects on mnemonic function most marked in the elderly. Structural imaging with X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in older patients with major depression shows evidence of structural abnormality compared with controls. These findings are not highly localizing but they tend to confirm the role of cognitive impairment as an important age-related risk factor for major depression. Perfusion or metabolic imaging reflects both reversible changes in function and permanent loss of active neurones. The usual finding has been reductions in anterior brain structures in major depression. Hypoperfusion tends to be greatest in frontal, temporal and parietal areas and most extensive in older (male) patients; high Hamilton scores tend to be associated with reduced uptake. There have also been correlations in the cingulate cortex between increased perfusion and other aspects of the mental state. In general, reductions in frontal areas may be more likely in patients with impoverished mental states. The more prominent impairments of memory are likely to be associated with the finding of impaired temporal function or with a more diffuse failure of neuromodulation.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

We failed to replicate earlier reports in these respects: (1) None of the psychotic patient groups, when compared with normal controls, showed lower response intensity, latency, or culmination time of the nystagmic response. (2) The schizophrenic groups did not manifest a prevalence of clinically significant asymmetry. We did, however, observe that chronic deteriorated schizophrenics and recent schizophrenics have significantly greater dysrhythmic responses. This diminished orderliness of nystagmus may explain previous reports of absent or diminished nystagmus in the schizophrenics. The results are not compatible with peripheral vestibular disease in schizophrenia, but they may reflect state-related phenomena consistent with disturbances in alertness, which are not necessarily voluntary or motivational in origin.",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

This syndrome is caused by numerous primary and secondary etiologies. The most common primary cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which reaches almost 50% of dementia cases. The DA it consists of biological fragments of the amyloid precursor protein that are deposited in the brain 10 years or more, before the first symptoms appear. The period before the onset of symptoms is called the preclinical stage. The transition between the silence of symptoms and their appearance, usually due to memory loss for recent events, is known as the prodromal phase. Continuing the pathophysiological process, the stage of mild dementia takes place, when the patient has one more cognitive component associated with memory loss; follows the moderate, severe, profound and terminal phase of dementia.",

      "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2.6% among U.S. adults, yet often goes unrecognized. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), BED is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating in a discrete period of time an amount of food larger than most people would eat in a similar amount of time under similar circumstances and a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode), occurring on average at least once a week for 3 months, and associated with marked distress. It can affect both men and women, regardless if they are at normal weight, overweight, or obese, and regardless of their ethnic or racial group. Psychiatric comorbidities are very common, with 79% of adults with BED also experiencing anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, or substance use disorders; almost 50% of persons with BED have ≥ 3 psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple neurobiological explanations have been proffered for BED, including dysregulation in reward center and impulse control circuitry, with potentially related disturbances in dopamine neurotransmission and endogenous μ-opioid signaling. Additionally, there is interplay between genetic influences and environmental stressors. Psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral interventions have been recommended as first line and are supported by meta-analytic reviews. Unfortunately, routine medication treatments for anxiety and depression do not necessarily ameliorate the symptoms of BED; however, at present, there is one approved agent for the treatment of moderate to severe BED-lisdexamfetamine, a stimulant that was originally approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

CASE A 37-year-old woman developed mood symptoms as well as progressive hyperphagia, hypersexuality, disinhibition, and impairment of judgment after delivery of her third child. She was unresponsive to multiple treatments for depression and was evaluated for frontal lobe syndromes. CONCLUSION Frontotemporal dementia, formerly known as Pick disease, is a primary degenerative dementia for which no cause is clearly established. Family history or genetic abnormalities are found in about 50% of cases. The diagnosis is frequently missed or delayed, as in this case, because it occurs in a younger age group, presents with unusual signs and symptoms, and is far less prevalent than Alzheimer disease.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

Amenorrhea is often mentioned as a symptom of depression. Other menstrual disturbances of unknown etiology which are usually classified as hypothalamic amenorrhea might also be a part of this spectrum. The connection between depression and alterations in gonadal function may have further psychophysiological implications. This could, in part, be due to the sequence of neuroendocrine events associated with depression, leading to decreased FSH and LH secretion from the anterior pituitary. Future studies using these constructs will be of use in further clarifying psychological and neuroendocrinological relationships.",

Vecina istraživaca danas definira depresivnost u terminima kontinuuma od normalne, povremene i prolazne žalosti do duboke depresije koja traje ili se stalno ponovo vraca. Danas se procjenjuje da oko 10-15% djece u opcoj populaciji ima znacajno izražene simptome depresije. Psihosomatski simptomi predstavljaju sve one tjelesne simptome koji se javljaju pod utjecajem emocionalnih cimbenika, a ukljucuju jedan organski sustav, obicno pod kontrolom autonomnog živcanog sustava. Simptomi se mogu javiti u rasponu od jednog ili vise simptoma slabijeg intenziteta pa sve do veceg broja vrlo intenzivnih simptoma koji djetetu ometaju svakodnevno funkcioniranje. Razliciti tjelesni simptomi psihogene etiologije koji se javljaju u djetinjstvu i adolescenciji dio su razlicitih klinickih slika (pa tako i depresije), a najcesce se opisuju u kategoriji razlicitih psihosomatskih i somatoformnih poremecaja (APA, 1996). U radu su prikazani rezultati istraživanja koje je provedeno s ciljem utvrđivanja specificnih aspekata depresivnosti koji su povezani s pojavom psihosomatskih simptoma u djece i adolescenata. Istraživanje je provedeno na uzorku od 315 ucenika (158 djevojcica i 157 djecaka) od 5. do 8. razreda osnovne skole. U istraživanju su primijenjene dvije skale: Skala depresivnosti za djecu i adolescente SDD (Vulic-Prtoric, 2003) i Upitnik psihosomatskih simptoma za djecu i adolescente PSS (Vulic-Prtoric, 2005). Rezultati provedenog istraživanja pokazuju da ispitanici koji postižu klinicki znacajno izražene simptome depresivnosti imaju i veci broj psihosomatskih simptoma (osobito pseudoneuroloskih, gastrointestinalnih, kardiovaskularnih) te da u vecoj mjeri doživljavaju glavobolje, umor i razlicite oblike bolova. Nadalje, utvrđene su spolne razlike kako u doživljavanju simptoma depresivnosti tako i psihosomatskih simptoma: u usporedbi s djecacima, djevojcice imaju znacajno veci broj simptoma. Zakljucak: Dobiveni rezultati potvrđuju teorijske postavke u razvojnoj psihopatologiji o dvosmjernoj povezanosti depresivnih i psihosomatskih simptoma: depresivnosti kao snažnom rizicnom cimbeniku u razvoju psihosomatskih reakcija, ali i kao posljedici dugotrajnijeg doživljavanja tjelesnih tegoba. Razmotrene su i prakticne implikacije dobivenih rezultata, posebice u planiranju tretmana djece sklone somatizaciji, te depresivne djece i adolescenata.",

Current and lifetime histories of depression in the adolescents were highly comorbid with several other mental disorders. The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder. Depression in both groups was more likely to occur after the other disorder rather than to precede it. Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression. Comorbidity in the adolescents was associated with greater frequency of suicidal behavior and treatment seeking. The findings suggest that early-onset depression is associated with a greater degree of comorbidity and may represent a more serious form of the disorder.",

Epidemiology PrevalenceThe prevalence of delirium varies with the population that is being studied (Fong et al., 2009).Delirium is a relatively common disorder, especially in older people with physical illness (Saxena & Lawley, 2009).Community rates of delirium are reported to vary from 0.4% to 2% (Saxena & Lawley, 2009, Fong et al., 2009).In general hospital setting prevalence of delirium has been reported to range from 11% to 33% on admission (Lindesay et al.,",

      "abstract": "As effects of excitement may be noted—( a ) those which are transitory, occurring during the excitement, and (b) those which persist. As transitory effects there may be an apparently general hypermnesia, in which there is a marked freshening of all memories, or there may be a selective hypermnesia, where certain rather narrow lines of association are followed. The lasting effects may be hypermnesia, hypomnesia, or total amnesia for events experienced during the excitement. The following lasting effects may also be noted upon experiences that have occurred before the emotion: (1) The well-known retro-active amnesia; (2) The opposite, retro-active hypermnesia to which little attention has formerly been paid; (3) a combination of both these effects; for the same person the stretch preceding the critical event may show vivid recollections followed by a period of utter blank. The retro-active hypermnesia in the author's cases rarely goes beyond the events of the day preceding the excitement. It occurred in 25 out of 225 cases. The antecedent events are unusually vivid—more vivid than any other of the patients' memories. The vividness is not confined to visual images, although these are more frequent; sounds, the mood, the general state of the mind may be clearly represented. There is some indication that women experience it more frequently than men. In some cases the effect has come at some crisis at early childhood, in others at a later date. The quality of the emotion seems of less importance than the intensity of the shock. Fear, or fearless surprise, or pleasurable surprise may be the cause. If the intensity be exceeded the experiences connected with it are in some degree suppressed; while if it be not reached the experiences are lost probably by a mere failure to gather up the events into the mesh of interest. Emotion facilitates the recall of whatever is noticed during the excitement, and it seems probable that memory images may be treated by the emotional onrush in the same way as perceptive images. The experiences of the preceding day, however, probably do not exist as actual images at the time of the emotion but as psycho-physical dispositions or traces, so that where there is retro-active hypermnesia the emotion would seem to have the power to strengthen these dispositions and the connections by which they may be called into life.

Este grupo definió el TSI como un cuadro caracterizado por la queja parental de movimientos gruesos frecuentes durante el sueño, de reposicionamiento y disrupción del sueño que causan deterioro significativo diurno. Los criterios diagnósticos incluyen presencia de síntomas durante 3 meses, al menos 3 veces por semana, y hallazgos polisomnográficos de al menos 5 movimientos/hora. Debe considerar cambios conductuales durante el día tales como somnolencia, irritabilidad e hiperactividad, y que estos no sean explicados por una condición médica, farmacológica o conductual secundaria. Su prevalencia está estimada en un 7,7 % de niños referidos por problemas de sueño. Los niños presentan usualmente niveles de ferritina bajo 50 ng/ml, un punto en común con el Síndrome de piernas inquietas. El tratamiento propuesto por expertos consiste en la suplementación de fierro, que ha demostrado beneficios en este grupo de pacientes. Para el diagnóstico debe descartarse cuadros secundarios de origen médico general u otros trastornos de sueño tales como Síndrome de piernas inquietas o Movimiento periódico de extremidades. El objetivo de esta revisión es revisar las recomendaciones actuales en esta entidad, describir las claves clínicas, fisiopatológicas y polisomnográficas, destacando la necesidad de dar a conocer este cuadro para ampliar los estudios en grupos etarios diferentes a los ya definidos y generar pautas de tratamiento.",

Depression is a particularly common and worrisome comorbidity, especially because suicidality seems to be increased significantly in the context of epilepsy. Although psychosocial stressors commonly are associated, intrinsic characteristics of seizure disorders may contribute to the expression of depressive symptoms. Depression and epilepsy may exacerbate each other. Epilepsy with seizure foci in the temporal lobe may represent a higher risk of developing depression, especially if the seizures do not generalize. Treatment of depression is multifaceted and includes psychotherapy and sophisticated regimens of anticonvulsants. Most antidepressants may be used safely and effectively in the context of depression, although high-quality evidence is lacking. Ultimately, treatment of comorbid mood disorder has important implications for outcome and quality of life, perhaps even more than treatment of epilepsy itself.",

In particular, the gradual shift of a single parameter may result in completely different kinds of behavior of the entire system just like water can be in three qualitatively different states depending on the single parameter temperature. Transitions between these different states are called bifurcations or phase transitions. In case of schizophrenia the parameter may be the neurotransmitter dopamine (or serotonin or glutamate). With a high level of dopamine transmission the symptoms of schizophrenia appear, and with rather low levels those of Morbus Parkinson. In between a healthy state prevails. With respect to neuronal activity the effects of dopamine are demonstrated by a mathematical model which can be interpreted in two ways: on the one hand as a model of typical excitatory-inhibitory circuits in the cortex, on the other hand of a negative feedback loop between thalamus, prefrontal cortex and striatum. The model exhibits different types of firing patterns and their bifurcation, from various kinds of periodicities up to erratic or chaotic behavior, corresponding to different levels of dopamine concentration.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

It was previously observed that some schizophrenic patients present a number of symptoms which are not likely to occur alone but are observed only in association with each other. The association of these symptoms in a consistent fashion seems to be indicative of a hitherto undescribed syndrome and therefore to merit closer study. The principal components of the syndrome in question are: 1. Severe disturbances of self-awareness: These are manifested in a great variety of complaints, of which the most important is the impression of being divided into two or more persons, and various symptoms of depersonalization. 2. The experience of motor influences and the impression of passivity: This disturbance is manifested in such complaints as: \"They move my arm.\" \"It is not I who is talking; the words just fly",

      "title": "Fatigue and brain arousal in patients with major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is considered a key symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), yet the term lacks specificity. It can denote a state of increased sleepiness and lack of drive (i.e., downregulated arousal) as well as a state of high inner tension and inhibition of drive with long sleep onset latencies (i.e., upregulated arousal), the latter typically found in depression. It has been proposed to differentiate fatigue along the dimension of brain arousal. We investigated whether such stratification within a group of MDD patients would reveal a subgroup with distinct clinical features. Using an automatic classification of EEG vigilance stages, an arousal stability score was calculated for 15-min resting EEGs of 102 MDD patients with fatigue. 23.5% of the patients showed signs of hypoarousal with EEG patterns indicating drowsiness or sleep; this hypoaroused subgroup was compared with remaining patients (non-hypoaroused subgroup) concerning self-rated measures of depressive symptoms, sleepiness, and sleep. The hypoaroused subgroup scored higher on the Beck Depression Inventory items “loss of energy” ( Z = − 2.13, p = 0.033; ɳ 2 = 0.044, 90% CI 0.003–0.128) and “concentration difficulty” ( Z = − 2.40, p = 0.017; ɳ 2 = 0.056, 90% CI 0.009–0.139), and reported higher trait and state sleepiness ( p &lt; 0.05) as compared to the non-hypoaroused group. The non-hypoaroused subgroup, in contrast, reported more frequently the presence of suicidal ideation (Chi 2 = 3.81, p = 0.051; ɳ 2 = 0.037, 90% CI 0.0008–0.126). In this study, we found some evidence that stratifying fatigued MDD patients by arousal may lead to subgroups that are pathophysiologically and clinically more homogeneous. Brain arousal may be a worth while target in clinical research for better understanding the mechanisms underlying suicidal tendencies and to improve treatment response.",

Both were transferred from other asylums, apparently incurable.

      "title": "[Modification of long-term schizophrenia by somato-therapeutic measures].",
      "abstract": "Controlled studies have revealed that neuroleptic treatment alone has a significant effect in schizophrenic patients and that with parenteral treatment with depot neuroleptics the relapse rate after 1 and 2 years is significantly lower than with oral neuroleptic medications. About 20% of schizophrenic patients do not have relapses even without treatment. The effectiveness of neuroleptic long-term medication with regard to the prevention of relapses was proved by discontinuation trials for a period of up to 3 years. Up to now, however, there is no proof that drug therapy influences the long-term prognosis beyond the 3 years. The results of the Bonn schizophrenia study show the extraordinary variability of the courses and outcomes. Although some anamnestic and clinical prognostically favourable or unfavourable factors could be found, a reliable individual prognosis at the onset of the disease is not possible. Initially phasic courses with complete remission of the early psychotic features can later nevertheless lead to residual syndromes; on the other hand, chronic persistent psychoses can show a permanent remission leaving only slightly, non-specific residual states even as late at the 2nd to the 4th decade of the disease independent of the therapy. Some findings of the Bonn study, indicating a favourable influence of psychical treatments on the long-term course are described. They include the so-called catastrophic schizophrenia which at a rate of 4% occurs less frequently than in the past, the significantly poorer long-term prognosis of those patients who had not been treated in the beginning of the disease (taking into account subgroups with peracute, acute and subacute onsets on the initial psychotic manifestations), the significantly less favourable long-term prognosis of patients whose disease began prior to the era of psychopharmacological drugs, and the significantly more frequent occurrence of complete remissions of patients of the subgroups with peracute and acute onsets of the psychosis who had started treatment within 1 year after the onset of the disease (including the prodromal stage). Early diagnosis and treatment of the prodromal symptoms can probably improve the chance of a complete remission. The finding of a higher rate of patients with mixed residual states at the expense of the typical schizophrenic defect psychoses within the partial subgroup of the specific residual state with long-term neurolepsy could suggest that long-term medications is responsible for the 'partially pharmacogenic change in symptomatology' of schizophrenia in as far as it causes or favours a shift from the typical syndromes to the mixed residual states mainly bought about by a potential reduction in symptoms.",

      "title": "Identifying the constructs to non-melancholic depression: stress",
      "abstract": "As noted in Chapter 1, the binary model of depression viewed one ‘type’ of depression (i. e. reactive or neurotic depression) as essentially being a response to a major or salient life-event stressor. By contrast, the other type of depression (endogenous or melancholic) was seen as a condition that occurred without any such trigger, with the term ‘endogenous’ emphasising that the depression came from ‘within’ rather than from stressors and the environment. We now turn to examine the role of life-event stressors in those with non-melancholic disorders. Life-event stressors may, theoretically, be all-explanatory and contribute totally to the onset of the depressive disorder. Terms such as ‘reactive depression’ and ‘adjustment disorder with depressed mood’ emphasise the contribution of a life event and do not recognise any predisposing or other factor. While life events may vary in their magnitude, one could posit that most of these ‘pure state’ reactions are likely to be in response to cataclysmic or extremely severe depressing events, and where it might be imagined that most people would develop such a depressive condition.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

Studies were included if they were in English, provided any definition of recovery and were longitudinal. Excluded articles were duplicated studies, case studies, review articles or articles related to alcohol, children, subsyndromal delirium only or those investigating core symptoms such as function.Fifty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Only two studies used clinical criteria alone for the diagnosis of delirium; most studies used at least one validated scale-either categorical or continuous severity scales. A variety of 16 different terms were used to define the 'recovery of delirium'. The definitions of each term also varied. Studies using severity scales used either cut-off points or percentage reduction between assessments, while others using dichotomous scales (yes/no) defined recovery as one or more days of negative delirium.An agreed terminology to define recovery in delirium is required. A distinction should also be made between symptomatic and overall recovery, as well as between long- and short-term outcomes. It is proposed that cognitive recovery should be central to defining recovery in delirium.",

      "abstract": "DRUGS, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE: TOWARD A THEORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY PAUL WILLNER* Levels ofExplanation ofPsychotropic Drug Effects A few micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) can produce a major psychological experience, usually described as an \"altered state of consciousness,\" which can sometimes be the most powerful experience a person has ever had. \"Explanations\" ofthese phenomena usually involve a discussion of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) [1, 2]. Clearly, however, a description of biochemical phenomena in no sense explains the LSD experience, since no account is offered of how the biochemical changes give rise to altered states of consciousness. A similar problem arises in relation to biochemical \"theories\" of mental disorder, such as the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia or the catecholamine hypothesis of depression. Paranoid delusions are not explained by demonstrating that DA systems are hyperactive; neither are ideas of suicide explained by a malfunction of noradrenergic (NA) systems . However successful these reductionist hypotheses may be in generating testable hypotheses, leading, for example, to the development of effective pharmacological agents, a hypothesis of brain function which omits any reference to the structure or operating principles ofthe brain is unlikely to be of more than heuristic value. An alternative approach attempts to bridge this conceptual gap by seeking explanations of psychotropic drug effects in four independent explanatory domains: biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and subjective (using die word \"cognitive\" in the information-processing sense in which it is now used in cognitive psychology, rather than as a synonym for \"conscious\"). In terms of a computer analogy, these four domains ?Psychology Department, City of London Polytechnic, Old Castle Street, London El 7NT, England.© 1984 by The University of Chicago. AU rights reserved. 003 1-5982/85/2801-0404$01 .00 Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 28, 1 · Autumn 1984 \\ 49 include two levels of \"hardware\" and two of \"software,\" corresponding very roughly to components, wiring, programming, and editing. Each explanatory domain has its own language and logic, and each must be understood in its own terms. A recent theory of the action of anti-anxiety drugs [3] will serve as an illustration. In this account, which is embedded within the context of a comprehensive neuropsychological theory of anxiety, anxiolytic drugs act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, or at other sites (level 1), to disrupt the flow of impulses in neural circuits in the hippocampus and subiculum (level 2). The information carried in these circuits is used to make a comparison between actual and expected events: a mismatch activates a \"behavioural inhibition system,\" which suppresses ongoing motor activity and increases arousal and attention to the environment (level 3); these effects are experienced as anxiety (level 4). Irrespective of its empirical merits [4], the hypothesis has a sound conceptual basis. The analysis spans all four levels ofexplanation, rather than the usual two: physiological (level 2) and cognitive (level 3) levels are interposed between biochemistry (level 1) and subjective experience (level 4). In addition to describing an empirical relationship between receptor interactions and an anti-anxiety effect, die account also specifies the neural pathways implicated, their role in normal cognitive functioning , and the relationship between changes in cognitive function and changes in experience. In describing the psychological effect of a drug or an endogenous biochemical change, it is important to consider not only the intervening levels of explanation but also the nature of the transitions between adjacent levels. The generation of changes in neural firing (level 2) from the biochemical effect of a drug (level 1) depends on the integration of that biochemical effect into a context of other ongoing biochemical processes , which include adaptive regulation resulting from the primary drug effect. The effect of tricyclic antidepressant drugs at noradrenergic synapses is a well-worked example: it is now established that, in addition to potentiating neurotransmission by blocking neurotransmitter reuptake, after chronic treatment, tricyclics also decrease neurotransmission by reducing the sensitivity of postsynaptic beta-receptors [5]. It is rather less frequendy recognized, however, that the important issue is the net outcome of these and other effects on the traffic of nerve impulses in postsynaptic structures [6, 7]. Similar considerations apply to die transition from physiology (level 2) to cognitive processes (level 3). A good...",

FM is the second most common rheumatic disorder behind osteoarthritis and, though still widely a puzzling syndrome, is now considered to be a central nervous system disorder, which is responsible for amplified and intensive pain. Over the years, three main ideas of hippocampal function have dominated the literature: Response inhibition, episodic memory, and spatial cognition. Given that the hippocampus plays integral roles in memory, cognition, and sleep regulations the later functions may be influenced by prolonged stress know to exist in FM syndrome. Moreover the hippocampus is an integral component of the limbic system, and as such may contribute to the negative affect and avoidance motivation experienced during pain experience and chronic stress.

These are the ones which lead to the most long-term disability and consequent poor outcome. Pharmacological interventions for schizophrenia which concentrate on the dopaminergic pathways have had little success in alleviating negative symptoms of this disabling illness. Indeed, there has been a dearth of pharmacological initiatives addressing negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Drug development seems to have been led by identifying and targeting a single explanatory mechanism for the disease. While each proposed explanatory mechanism has clear merits, each also has limitations. The most probable neuropathological explanation of schizophrenia is not confined to a single receptor or neural system, but the interaction of several dysfunctional ones. The especially aggressive nature of schizophrenia leads to a (variable) degree of cerebral tissue loss with each exacerbation of the illness. Understanding schizophrenia as a potentially neurodegenerative disease with neurodevelopmental antecedents may thus be a useful shift in the therapeutic appreciation of this illness. It is essential to remember that psychological and social factors also have neurological consequences: epigenetic influence is one way to understand the psychopathology of these consequences. This is, of course, the rationale for holistic treatment of the illness generally. The wide-ranging pathology of schizophrenia means that holistic management of it will always be required and the concentration on a single pathological pathway is one which both leads researchers to unrewarding conclusions and results in an unsatisfactory outcome for the person who suffers from schizophrenia. Successful management of this illness is therefore always holistic, including the maintenance of appropriate suitable medication as well as psychological and social interventions which are recovery focussed. A thorough understanding of all of the factors involved in schizophrenic illness therefore narrows the translational gap.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Insomnia is commonly defined as repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia). This occurs despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep to occur and is associated with impairment of daytime function. Patients with insomnia may describe frequent extended periods of wakefulness during the sleep period or persistent morning awakenings that are earlier than desired (terminal insomnia). Insomnia can be divided on the basis of its duration into transient or short-term (lasting only a few days to three to four weeks) or chronic (persisting for more than one to three months). This chapter on pharmacologic therapy of sleep disturbance will be limited to the treatment of chronic insomnia.",

Complex consciousness, including cognition, perception, and memory, under conditions such as cardiac arrest and general anesthesia, when it cannot be associated with normal brain function, requires a revised cosmology anchored not in 19th-century classical physics but rather in 21st-century quantum physics that includes consciousness in its conceptual formulation. Classical physics, anchored in materialist reductionism, offered adequate descriptions of everyday mechanics but ultimately proved insufficient for describing the mechanics of extremely high speeds or small sizes, and was supplemented a century ago by quantum physics. Materialist psychology, modeled on the reductionism of classical physics, likewise offered adequate descriptions of everyday mental functioning but ultimately proved insufficient for describing mentation under extreme conditions, such as the continuation of mental function when the brain is inactive or impaired, such as occurs near death.",

Objectives Increase knowledge about paraphrenia, a classic diagnosis that no longer appears on international classifications. Methods Extensive research on the historical path of the paraphrenia diagnostic entity was carried out. Patient’s data is obtained from medical history and psychiatric interviews done during her hospitalizations. Results 68 year-old patient attended the hospital emergency service due to a demonic possession delusion that emerged when she was 44 year-old, when she first consulted a psychiatrist because she believed someone introduced the demon inside her body. She described kinesthetic hallucinations as “movements of her brain” and an intense headache, both originated by the demon; as well as other types of hallucinations and confabulations. However, there was no deterioration in her personaliy or her intellectual capacity, as it could have been seen in a case of schizophrenia. This clinical case is considered a paraphrenia phantastica as it presents the typical features raised by the classic authors (mainly Henry Ey): paralogical thought dominance, megalomania, confabulation and integrity of relation with reality. Conclusions Current internacional classifications do not consider paraphrenia as a differentiated diagnostic entity, as it also occurs with other classical entities. This causes a loss of important tools that would achieve a better approach to the patient’s condition. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu.

Robust epidemiological data for chronic mania are lacking with regard to its prevalence and clinical features. The present case report is of a 48-year-old male with a six-year history of mood and psychotic symptoms, based on which differential diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder (manic type), schizophrenia, and mania with psychotic symptoms (with chronic course) were made. The diagnosis of chronic mania was confirmed considering the predominance of fluctuating mood symptoms along with psychotic symptoms, lack of remission, and chronic course of illness. Antipsychotics were initially started for six weeks, to which the patient demonstrated a minimal response. A mood stabilizer was added to the regimen, leading to significant improvement, and the patient was discharged. According to existing literature, patients with chronic mania present with severe illness, the presence of psychotic symptoms, and socio-occupational impairment, which was also noticed in this case. The prevalence of chronic mania among patients with bipolar disorder is approximately 13-15%, which constitutes a significant proportion of known mental illnesses. Therefore, chronic mania should be added as a distinct clinical entity in the existing nosological systems.",

      "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations can be experienced in the context of many different disorders and syndromes. The differential diagnosis basically rests on the presence or absence of accompanying symptoms. In terms of clinical relevance, the most important distinction to be made is between auditory hallucinations occurring in the context of psychotic disorders and those that are due to a somatic disorder. Auditory hallucinations are also quite common in otherwise healthy individuals and are therefore not necessarily disease-related. As auditory hallucinations are often accompanied by hallucinations in other modalities, pinpointing the modality in which hallucinations are experienced most frequently may provide a first – albeit coarse – indication of whether the auditory hallucinations are part of a neurological disorder (mainly visual), a psychiatric disorder (mainly auditory), an ear disorder (mainly auditory) or whether they occur in the absence of any disorder (mainly auditory). Epilepsy is the most important exception to this coarse differentiation. Another traditional distinction between hallucinations occurring in the context of neurological and psychiatric disorders is that the former are assumed to start at an advanced age, whereas hallucinations in the context of psychiatric disorders typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood. Although there are many exceptions to this rule of thumb – as in psychotic depression, late-onset schizophrenia and epilepsy – age of onset can still be a valuable clinical indicator. The content of auditory hallucinations is notoriously unreliable for differential diagnosis and the safest way to an accurate diagnosis rests with the detection of psychiatric and somatic comorbid symptoms.",

His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal.

A broader definition includes symptoms such as delirious thoughts, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, cognitive and mood symptoms and what is called negative symptoms. Several researches have been done focused in the treatment of first episode of psychosis showing clozapine as a keystone in the treatment of psychosis, especially in refractory first episodes. Objectives Clozapine has unique efficacy in improving treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia but the moment of instauration remains unclear. There have always been doubts about the right moment to start clozapine, after two or more previous anti-psychotics or as first option. Materials and methods We report a 18-year- old woman with family history of severe psychosis. Her mum reasserted patient's symptoms contributing to a longer period of non-treating psychosis (about 10 months). Auditory hallucinations, incongruent mood and incoherent language appeared for the first time at the age of 17. High doses of two consecutive anti-psychotics were tried without remission and finally clozapine was initiated with clinical improvement. Discussion In clinical practice, a subgroup of psychotic patients experience, significant ongoing positive symptoms despite of using first line anti-psychotic medication. Conclusion Most recent research; suggest that clozapine may have an important role in the early treatment of first-episode patients, even becoming a first line option to consider.

The dispute arises about the type of cognitive decline, whether it has characteristic features that distinguish it from other forms of dementia, its severity and its course. Early case reports include descriptions of a variability of cognition, usually of arousal, in LBD confirmed by larger retrospective clinico-pathological series. Fluctuation in cognitive state either in the form of episodic confusional states resembling delirium or transient periods of reduced or loss of consciousness, superimposed on a background variability is described in 80% of patients in some series.

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "title": "Clinical Update: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a term applied to individuals who report severe chronic fatigue out of proportion to their efforts, but the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Fourth and Fifth Editions, are clear that no ratable impairment is linked to CFS. Chronic fatigue is not synonymous with CFS; only a small fraction of persons who present with chronic fatigue symptoms meet the criteria for CFS; and CFS, like fibromyalgia and multiple chemical sensitivity, is poorly understood. CFS may be associated with disability but primarily is based on psychological rather than physical symptoms. No tests confirm the diagnosis of CFS, and routine laboratory testing is reserved for excluding other medical conditions. CFS is an illness without a disease and often is characterized by illness behavior expressed as somatization. To date, no convincing evidence supports the notion that CFS is an infectious, neuroendocrine, or immunologic disorder. Thus, sophisticated behavioral assessment is critical and may include a fatigue rating scale, a depression scale, and psychological and personality inventories. No specific treatment has been recommended for CFS treatment, but cognitive and behavioral interventions may be useful to address psychological symptoms; medication is reserved for specific symptoms indicative of depression or anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a condition or phenomenon of decreased ability and efficiency of mental and/or physical activities, caused by excessive mental or physical activities, diseases, or syndromes. It is often accompanied by a peculiar sense of discomfort, a desire to rest, and reduced motivation, referred to as fatigue sensation. Acute fatigue is a normal condition or phenomenon that disappears after a period of rest; in contrast, chronic fatigue, lasting at least 6 months, does not disappear after ordinary rest. Chronic fatigue impairs activities and contributes to various medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, epileptic seizures, and death. In addition, many people complain of chronic fatigue. For example, in Japan, more than one third of the general adult population complains of chronic fatigue. It would thus be of great value to clarify the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and to develop efficient treatment methods to overcome it. Here, we review data primarily from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments related to neural dysfunction as well as autonomic nervous system, sleep, and circadian rhythm disorders in fatigue. These data provide new perspectives on the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and on overcoming it.",

      "title": "The Treatment of Acute Agitation in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute agitation is a nonspecific term applied to an array of syndromes and behaviors. It is frequently defined as an increase in psychomotor activity, aggression, disinhibition/impulsivity, and irritable or labile mood. Etiologies of acute agitation include medical disorders, delirium, substance intoxication or withdrawal, psychiatric disorders, and medication side effects. Treatment of acute agitation requires both environmental and pharmacologic intervention. Patients should be calmed with sedating agents early in the course of treatment, allowing for diagnostic tests to take place. Failure to correctly diagnose causes of agitation may lead to delayed treatment for serious conditions, and can even exacerbate agitation.The most common cause of agitation in patients with schizophrenia is psychotic relapse due to medication nonadherence. Pharmacologic treatment options for these patients include lorazepam and antipsychotic agents. Lorazepam causes nonspecific sedation and treats some substance withdrawal, but has little effect on psychosis. First-generation antipsychotics treat psychosis and, at high enough doses, cause sedation, but may induce extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Some second-generation antipsychotics have been approved for the treatment of agitation in schizophrenia. These agents treat psychosis with a favorable EPS profile, but are comparatively expensive and cause risks such as hypotension. However, avoiding EPS may reduce patients' resistance to antipsychotic treatment. In this expert roundtable supplement, Joseph Battaglia, MD, provides an overview of the definition of acute agitation. Next, Delbert, G. Robinson, MD, outlines evaluation methods for actue agitation. Finally, Leslie Citrome, MD, MPH, reviews interventions for acute and ongoing management of agitation.",

My disabilities after the strokes lay not only in the mechanical execution of commands and the ability of contraction of muscles, but also in mental processes like perception, attention, memory, and thought. These impediments have meant drastic changes in my living conditions and social status. My disability was multifaceted and involved my whole person. Its expression was somatic, psychic, and behavioural. I suffered from loss of appetite, disturbance of sleep, psychic anxiety, depression, anguish, aggressive reactions, communication difficulties, disorganization of conduct, and so on. My personality no longer matched up to my own expectations. I was trapped in a situation of impossibility of living, despair, and hopelessness. I was confronted with a problem I could not circumvent, and I had insufficient skills available to solve it. I had fallen into a state of nothingness. My life was in crisis.",

      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behaviours are relatively rare and are not known to be associated with social phobias, with an intense scientific debate on going if it constitutes a behavioral addiction. Compulsive sexual behaviours otherwise known as Hypersexuality/problematic sexual behaviour and is identified by a persistent pattern of failure to control repetitive, intense urges, fantasies and behaviours of a sexual nature over an extended period of time that causes marked impairment in multiple areas of functioning, in this case, especially educational functioning. Phobic anxiety disorders also known as social phobias are a group of conditions in which anxiety is triggered typically in well-defined situations that are not currently dangerous with resulting avoidance of such situations. Nevertheless, CSB is not captured in DSM V and ICD10, although, diagnostic criteria were proposed during DSM V revision, it is not currently recognized in the DSMV. Although, CSB has been proposed for inclusion in ICD 11 as an impulse control disorder, rather than as a mental and behavioural disorder as previously debated, in addition, strict diagnostic guidelines were instituted due to concerns of over pathologizing sexual behaviours. This presents a diagnostic and treatment dilemma for the psychiatrist when a patient presents with symptoms of Compulsive sexual behaviours with or without anxiety, since there are presently no diagnostic and treatment guidelines. We present the case of a 23 year old 3rd year medical student with a 5 year history of compulsive masturbation, persistent pornography viewing, failure to resist impulses and fantasies with accompanying intense distress especially following periods of abstinence and a two year history of recurrent panic attacks in social settings in which women were triggers complicated by depressive symptoms, symptoms significantly impaired most areas of functioning particularly his academics.\r\n\r\n A diagnosis of Social Phobia/Social Anxiety disorder with episodic panic attacks and compulsive sexual behaviours and mild depressive episode was made because patient met criteria according to ICD 10 and proposed ICD 11. Mental state examination shows anxious mood, congruent with affect, depersonalization, derealization as well as anxious ruminations. Within a year, after commencement of an SSRI, Atenolol and Lisonopril and CBT all anxiety symptoms resolved with marked reduction in the frequency of pornography viewing as well as compulsive masturbation with associated fantasies. This case report lends voice to the on-going debate about the inclusion of compulsive sexual behaviours as a mental and behavioural disorder Dependence syndrome in diagnostic classification systems as well as the need for development of standardized appropriate treatment modalities. This case report will highlight Compulsive Sexual Behaviours, rationale for its inclusion as an addiction in classification systems and treatment approaches to the disorder.",

Almost 50% deaf and mute patients diagnosed with psychosis report “hearing of voices which others cannot hear” in the absence of any external stimulus. Similar percentage of patients report visual and tactile hallucinations. The assessment of psychosis in such patients become difficult due to lack of tools and training of medical professionals in communication with such patients. There exists some literature which shows association in the neurobiology of auditory hallucinations and hearing impairment. The following case report illustrates a case of psychosis in a deaf and mute patient CASE REPORT A 17 years old unmarried female, not formally educated, unemployed, deaf and mute since birth with easy premorbid temperament no history of any comorbid illness and no family history of any psychiatric or neurological illness presented with insidious onset continuous course of total duration since last 1 year characterized by verbal and physical aggression, suspiciousness, muttering to self, hearing of voices that others cannot hear, odd behaviour, poor self care, decreased sleep. Patient was admitted due to unmanageability at home. On mental status examination, patient was agitated, violent towards herself and her family members.

Little is known about their coexistence with other non-functional movement disorders and their impact on the general disease burden. Investigating frequency and characteristics of functional movement disorders in GCH1-positive dopa-responsive dystonia patients. Twenty-one patients underwent a detailed clinical motor examination and completed self-questionnaires evaluating non-motor characteristics. Seven patients (33 %) had comorbid functional movement symptoms, including functional gait disorders (n = 7), balance disturbances (n = 7), and weakness (n = 5), dominating the clinical phenotype and resulting in disability with immobilization. None of them was previously diagnosed with or treated for the functional symptoms. Functional movement symptoms appeared suddenly (on average 18 years after the first dopa-responsive dystonia symptoms) and were unresponsive to L-Dopa. These patients showed significantly higher disability and received unnecessary treatments. Functional neurological movement disorders are common in patients with dopa-responsive dystonia and impact the clinical picture and the degree of disability. Diagnosing both disorders in an individual patient has substantial therapeutical implications because increases in L-Dopa dosages to treat functional symptoms should be avoided, and physiotherapy should relocate attention away from the affected body region so that movements in the affected body part can be executed without external control to facilitates automatic movements. Physiotherapy should be complemented by psychoeducation and psychotherapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "When neurology and psychiatry moved apart from each other around the turn of the 20th century, casualties included the many patients with unexplained neurological disorders. Many labels have been applied to these patients. Some are descriptive (functional disorders, medically unexplained symptoms), while others refer to a presumed aetiology (psychogenic, hysteria, non-organic) or putative mechanism (dissociative or conversion disorder). Whatever is the label, for some physicians these patients are among the most interesting and challenging in the clinic. For others they are frustrating, using much time and resources for an often disappointing outcome.\n\nWhether you are an enthusiast or nihilist, it is clear that that neither neurology nor psychiatry alone have succeeded in sufficiently advancing our neurobiological understanding or management of these disorders. The slow progress is in stark contrast to the scale of the problem. Medically unexplained neurological symptoms account for ∼30% of referred neurology out-patients (Carson et al. , 2000; Stone et al. , 2009). Conversion disorder alone, explicitly associated with psychological stressors at the outset, accounts for ∼5% of referrals and is a stable, accurate diagnosis (Perkin, 1989; Stone et al. , 2005, 2009).\n\nPsychogenic movement disorders are common in neurological practice, including tremor, dystonia, gait change and paralysis. Diagnostic criteria emphasize clinical observations such as inconsistency, distractibility and false neurological signs (Fahn and Williams, 1988). These can be both sensitive and specific, at least in the context of a movement disorder clinic (Shill and Gerber, 2006). Physiological criteria have also been developed, such as coherence of tremor oscillations distinguishing psychogenic from organic syndromes (McAuley and Rothwell, 2004). The emphasis in this ‘neurological’ approach is on the physical examination, supplemented by physiological tests. The psychological aspects of the disease take second place, e.g. requiring ‘obvious’ but not specified psychiatric or emotional disturbance (Fahn and Williams, 1988 …",

U klinickoj slici u starijih osoba u odnosu na mlađe cesce su prisutni: agitacija, psihomotorna retardacija, hipohondrijaza/somatizacije, histrionsko ponasanje, bitno smanjenje unosa hrane i tekucine te pseudodemencija. Dijagnosticki postupci obuhvacaju obavezno uz anamnezu i heteroanamnezu, MMSE, tjelesni pregled, EKG, laboratorijske pretrage + dodatne dijagnosticke pretrage - određivanje vitamina BI 2, folne kiseline, Fe, hormona stitnjace, EEG te CT/MR mozga. Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten. Kod izrazito suicidalnih pacijenta može se dodati klozapin u vrlo niskoj dozi od 6, 25 mg u vecernjoj dozi. Pocetne doze i raspon doza antidepresiva u starijih osoba iznosi Vl- Vi doze za mlade odrasle osobe. Prikaz slucaja: Bolesnica u dobi 76 godina, lijecena u sedam navrata u KB Vrapce pod dijagnozama granicnog poremecaja licnosti, vaskularnedemencijenakonpreboljelog CVI-a i vaskularne depresije. Sklona je dramaticnim demonstrativnim ispadima, somatizacijama i manipulativnom parasuicidalno'm ponasanju. Inace osjetljiva je na psihofarmake zbog vaskularnog parkinsonizma. Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the significance of EEG findings relating to the appearance of psychic symptoms in epileptic children, a clinicoelectroencephalographic study was undertaken on 15 cases with psychotic episodes. 1) Psychotic episodes with hallucination and/or illusion were observed, though rarely, in childhood epilepsy. These seemed liable to occur in temporal lobe epilepsy. 2) Three of four patients in the hallucination and illusion group showed frequent epileptic discharges. However, no distinct relation existed between seizure discharges and psychotic episodes. 3) Eight of 11 patients in the dysphoria and excitement group were secondary generalized epilepsy. 4) In the dysphoria and excitement group, psychotic episodes occurred either as a result of the increase in epileptic discharges or conversely as a result of the suppression of epileptic discharges. The former was more frequent. Epileptic discharges tended to be suppressed in the Lennox syndrome and allied conditions relating to psychotic episodes. 5) A forced normalization-like phenomenon mostly resulted from the marked suppression of diffuse slow spike-waves. However, a complete suppression of epileptic discharges was not always noted.",

      "title": "A Life Setting Conducive to Illness",
      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "title": "Core symptoms of major depressive disorder: relevance to diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "The construct of major depressive disorder makes no etiological assumptions about populations with diverse symptom clusters. “Depressed mood” and “loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities” are core features of a major depressive episode, though a strong case can be made to pay increasing attention to symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and neurocognitive and sexual dysfunction in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment outcome. Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

      "title": "Obstetric antecedents of cerebral palsy",
      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy has been defined as a group of non-progressive disorders of movement or posture due to a defect or lesion of the immature brain. 1 Cerebral palsy is defined by clinical description only; there is no definitive test. It is not informative about aetiolgy, pathology or prognosis. The definition of cerebral palsy also lacks precision in that neither the age at which the brain is mature nor the severity of the disorder required are specified. Brain development is most rapid in utero and early childhood but continues at a diminished rate throughout life. There is therefore no biological rationale for choosing any particular age to define brain maturity. The defining age below whcih cerebral palsy may be recognised therefore varies between centres for pragmatic reasons usually associated with assertainment. For example, in Western Australia the criterion is set at 5 years, 2 since by this age any central motor impairments of congenital or neonatal origin will be apparent and can usually be differentiated from progressive disorders or isolated motor delay. Thus the definition includes a group of children with post-neonatally acquired brain damage resulting in movement disorder. Post-neonatally acquired cerebral palsy differs from presumed congenital or perinatal cerebral palsy in that there is usually no doubt that it was caused by a specific post-neonatal event such as meningitis or head trauma. Although there is an excess of perinatal morbidity amoung children acquiring cerebral palsy post-neonatally, 3 suggesting a prior vulnerability in some cases, post neonatally acquired cerebral palsy will not be considred further in this review.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

The pattern was of mild but typical depressive symptoms. Residual symptoms were more common in subjects with more severe initial illness, but were not related to any other predictors, including longer prior illness, dysthymia, or lower dose of drug treatment during the illness episode. There were weak associations with personality that might have been consequences of symptom presence. Residual symptoms were very strong predictors of subsequent early relapse, which occurred in 76% (13/17) of those with residual symptoms and 25% (10/40) of those without.",

      "title": "A Protracted Case of Psychosis, Motor Abnormalities, and Agitation",
      "abstract": "Sir: Somatization is a psychological process whereby psychological distress is expressed in the form of somatic symptoms.1 Conversion disorder is a type of somatization that presents with signs and symptoms limited to the central nervous system.2 Despite the substantial literature, the exact etiology of conversion disorder is still controversial. Two important DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of conversion disorder include association of psychological factors with either initiation or exacerbation of symptoms and inability to explain the symptoms due to any general medical condition. Some earlier studies have postulated that the prognosis of this disorder varies with symptoms; for example, seizures and tremors would have worse prognosis as compared to weakness and sensory disturbance.3 We present an interesting case by its complicated course and sudden improvement of what we believe is conversion disorder.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr. A, a 30-year-old male Honduran native, was brought to the emergency department by his family secondary to fainting, questionable seizures, fever, recent right arm numbness, and agitated behavior. The history was obtained from the patient's sister as Mr. A was unable to answer questions reliably and did not speak English. The sister reported that his symptoms began approximately 2 weeks earlier, when he experienced an episode of twitching and foaming at the mouth consistent with a seizure. He was seen by a medical doctor at another hospital at that time and was discharged home; however, 2 days later he experienced a second seizure with the same symptoms. Mr. A was again taken to the hospital, where he was admitted and discharged home 2 days later.\r\n\r\nAt that time, Mr. A was started on phenytoin 100 mg t.i.d. He was also started on risperidone 1 mg nightly and diazepam 5 mg p.r.n for agitation. Since then, the patient markedly deteriorated in terms of thought organization. Initially he was more forgetful and subsequently became grandiose, believing he was god and trying to stop traffic, reasoning that, as god, he would not get hurt. He also began having visual and auditory hallucinations that his father, who passed away several months ago, was speaking to him through the television.\r\n\r\nThe patient's family reported a possible seizure episode with similar symptoms approximately 7 years ago. The family stated that the patient was typically a pleasant, well-mannered gentleman without any alcohol problems or illicit drug use.\r\n\r\nMr. A was admitted to the university hospital floor at this time and initiated on vancomycin, acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and thiamine as empiric therapy for meningitis. His phenytoin level was 3.0 µg/mL in the emergency department. A lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid was negative for infection and malignancy. Urine and blood culture findings were negative as well. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed borderline low inferior cerebellar tonsils, but findings were otherwise normal.\r\n\r\nHe also complained of some psychotic symptoms, seeing horns on the television, ideas of reference, and grandiosity. Risperidone was raised to 2 mg nightly with 1 mg every 8 hours p.r.n., and lorazepam 5 mg p.r.n. was given for agitation, and diazepam treatment was stopped; however, he continued to have agitation throughout his hospital stay. Ceftriaxone, vanco-mycin, and acyclovir were discontinued as cultures remained negative, and polymerase chain reaction assay for herpes simplex virus was also negative. His phenytoin therapy was continued. After a 2-day hospital stay, he was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for further care with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder with psychotic features and seizure disorder.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, he was readmitted to the psychiatric hospital for increasing seizure activity, reportedly 2 to 3 episodes daily for 3 or 4 days. Psychiatric hospital staff also reported that Mr. A had become less responsive and less cooperative with hospital personnel. He would not bathe himself nor go to the bathroom and had refused to eat or drink for the previous 2 or 3 days. In the same time period, the patient also appeared to be having more hallucinations. At the time of admission, Mr. A was very agitated and speech was nonexistent. Quetia-pine and lithium were started to help him with his agitation. Quetiapine was titrated up to 450 mg q.a.m. and 450 mg q.h.s., and lithium was titrated up to 300 mg b.i.d. An electroencephalogram showed no seizure activity. There was increased muscle tone and muscle rigidity in both arms and legs. The remaining findings of the examination were within normal limits.\r\n\r\nAt admission, Mr. A was started on intravenous (IV) fluids. He was loaded on divalproex 1000 mg and was started on a valproate dose of 500 mg t.i.d. IV. Due to the patient's psychosis, the dose of risperidone was adjusted to 3 mg nightly and 1 mg every 4 hours p.r.n. The patient's creatine kinase (CPK) was 2124 U/L. Risperidone was switched to olanzapine 5 mg daily due to a concern of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which was later ruled out. The patient continued to be agitated during his hospital course; however, no seizure activity was observed. Eventually, the patient was switched to oral valproate. The patient's CPK levels fluctuated throughout his hospital course, which may have been due to the patient's being restrained. The patient was in 4-point restraints because of his physical aggression.\r\n\r\nThe patient then began to eat a majority of meals and was able to urinate and have bowel movements. He had no seizures throughout the hospitalization. After a week of hospitalization, the patient was again discharged from the inpatient psychiatry hospital.\r\n\r\nHe continued to have refractory psychotic symptoms and subsequently began electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment. Following his third ECT episode, Mr. A had onset of status epi-lepticus and was transferred back to the university hospital. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for intubation for airway protection; loaded with fosphenytoin, pheny-toin, and midazolam; and placed on a ventilator. Lithium and quetiapine were discontinued. In the ICU, he continued to have waning levels of consciousness and responsiveness, occasional seizure activity, right facial twitching, and lip smacking. He had some minor seizure activities, but remained stable and was subsequently transferred out of the ICU. On the general hospital ward, Mr. A continued seizure free for weeks.\r\n\r\nLater one day, his family arrived, and, to our surprise, Mr. A started talking with them. We requested his family to visit with him more frequently. In response to increased visitation, we noticed that the patient started to get more responsive and eventually became more alert and oriented. His condition remained stable, and after a 1-month hospital stay, Mr. A was diagnosed with DSM-IV conversion disorder and transferred to a hospital at his home in Honduras per the family's request.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be an unusual case of what we believe to be conversion disorder. Although this patient might have an underlying bipolar disorder with psychotic features, the sudden resolution of symptoms associated with the visitation from his family clues us toward a diagnosis of conversion disorder.\r\n\r\nConversion disorder is a challenging psychiatric illness that represents a somatic defense against threats to mental instability.1 The rate of misdiagnosis of conversion disorder has significantly dropped from 29% in 1950s to 17% in 1960s to 4% in 1990s, an outcome that has partly been associated with improvement in the diagnostic methods.4 The management of this disorder should be focused on developing a therapeutic alliance with the patient and to further explore the areas of the patient's life beyond the presenting symptoms, to develop a treatment plan centered around reduction of distress, and to address other comorbid illnesses.5 Close attention should be paid to the physiologic needs of the patient including mobility, skin care, disuse atrophy, and contractures to prevent troublesome injury.6\r\n\r\nContrary to earlier beliefs, it has now been suggested that the presence of an occult neurologic disorder is not responsible for the symptom production, and the chances of missing a neurologic disorder are low.5 In one study, it has been reported that 20% of 50 documented cases of conversion disorder had a coexisting neurologic disorder.7 Some studies are conflicting in that they argue the presence of organic brain disorders in their early stages when they are most difficult to detect.8\r\n\r\nWhile dealing with this interesting case, we also kept in mind a differential diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malingering, and factitious disorder. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome was ruled out due to the absence of fever, rigidity, and other autonomic instability. A trial of intramuscular lorazepam was also given with no benefits. Despite the extensive workup, an underlying occult neurologic or medical illness could not be completely ruled out, but the sudden change in the symptomatology demonstrated by this patient upon visits by his close family members favored a diagnosis of conversion disorder.",

Thus a specific role for neurochemical or neuroendocrine factors certainly cannot be postulated or elucidated to explain such behavior in its entirety. Even when the term “antisocial” is used in other than a legal or criminological sense – for example, when it is applied in psychiatric diagnostics in an attempt to define and understand individual human behavior more fully – it remains overinclusive. From a clinical standpoint, the term “antisocial” most often signifies antisocial personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1952, 1968, 1980), which in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) is considered an “axis II” personality disorder, which may or may not coexist with certain “axis I” clinical syndromes or other conditions. Simply stated, this means that, according to current diagnostic nomenclature, an antisocial personality disorder theoretically could coexist with an organic mental disorder, substance use disorder, paranoid disorder, depressive disorder, psychosexual disorder, and so on.",

      "title": "Somatic delusional disorder in a patient with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus",
      "abstract": "Background: The delusional disorder represents one of the most difficult psychiatric disorders in terms of treatment and management because of the beliefs and convictions presented by the patient, the absence of insight and also the treatment-resistance. Of these, the somatic delusion or the hypochondriac delusion represent that situation in which the patient presents the conviction that certain parts of his body doesn`t work properly and that some parts of its have exaggerated or diminished dimensions or they present various unpleasant olfactory and tasteful features. One of the specificities of this disorder is represented by the non-bizarre character of the delusion in contrast to the others bizarre delusions specific to schizophrenia but which the patient supports without a doubt in contrast to the somatoform disorder. (1) Purpose and methods: The purpose of the presentation is to highlight the evolution of such a somatic delusion disorder and the challenges met throughout the diagnosis and investigation processes corroborating the brain changes we found with the prognosis of the current disorder. Description of the case: D.E. is a 64 years old woman presenting in our clinic having in her psychiatric antecedents only one admission until now and which presents a delusion somatic disorder consisting of T8-T10 located vertebral-thoracic hyperalgesia accompanied by depressive mood with anhedonia, high-intensity anxiety and abulia. The patient argues that she suffered a thoracic-lumbar trauma by falling from the same level 8 years ago and since then the somatic complaints appeared. All this time the patient underwent three surgeries located at the vertebra-thoracic level, without a consistent improvement of the symptoms. At the cerebral computerized tomography performed in our clinic is highlighted a normal pressure hydrocephalus. Following psychotropic treatment and various inter-clinical consultations the patient exits our service with an improved affective status and a still maintained but low-intensity somatic delusion. Conclusions: It is necessary that the somatic delusion disorder be strictly differentiated by the somatoform disorder and the major depressive disorder with somatic complaints. Also, the differential diagnosis of the possible somatic etiologies must be taken into account. In this regard the psychiatric interview and the brain changes highlighted paraclinically may be essential in the diagnosis and the future evolution of the psychiatric disorder.",

It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience.

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation.

      "title": "Promoting Recovery",
      "abstract": "When someone recovers from a physical illness, others often think of him or her as cured. But what about in the field of mental health? Presently, there is no cure for some mental illnesses that cause an episode of psychosis, such as schizophrenia. So, what does it mean for a person with a mental illness like this to recover? One way of thinking about recovery is that instead of people recovering from a mental illness, they recover despite the mental illness. In other words, people can develop meaningful activities and relationships while learning to manage and live with their mental illness. Recovery is different from remission. Remission means that the major symptoms, usually positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, are no longer active. The goals of remission and recovery go hand in hand. Aiming for remission using medicines and psychosocial treatments is important because recovery is easier when symptoms are under control. But, recovery is a much broader concept, pertaining to one’s life goals, rather than to symptom control. Some people experiencing psychosis may appear to recover completely. Others may require ongoing work to improve to the greatest possible level of recovery despite having a long-term illness. The recovery movement is a recent change in thinking about treatment and living with a serious mental illness. Before, to most people, the word recovery meant that a patient was symptom-free or improved to some point set by medical professionals. In the new way of thinking, recovery begins by focusing on the person’s thoughts and goals about his or her life rather than his or her illness, then moves into helping the individual figure out how he or she fits into his or her own community and larger society. Individuals themselves decide on their personal goals for treatment and recovery instead of mental health professionals deciding for them. Recovery involves an individual reaching his or her goals for independent living, employment, social relationships, and community participation. People with mental illnesses want to be citizens, to participate in shared relationships, and to give something to their communities. Increasing an individual’s social skills and ability to function in society is a major part of the recovery process.",

Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms.

Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "abstract": "Depression can be observed in individuals with any type of personality structure especially in situations in which change is involved. The mourning model is not sufficient to account for the type of difficulties, the particular mood and the lowered self-esteem so characteristic of depressive syndromes. The study of the psychological development of children helps us to sort out those situations which are of depressive type. However, not a single past incident during childhood can be clearly singled out as a causal factor of adult depression. Depressed adults as well as neurotics, psychotics, psychopaths or alcoholics have in common the fact that they have experienced early separation more often than control subjects. The attempts to isolate a particular aspect of the premorbid personality of depressed individuals are not at all conclusive. The notion of the typus-melancholicus (Tellenbach) has, however, the value of emphasizing the limiting character of these personalities: the need for a restricted perimeter of activity, limitations as concerns daily goals and painful sensitivity to change. The psychological reconstruction of depression can be done only after the event.",

      "abstract": "The presence of delusions or hallucinations in major depressive disorder indicates a severe form of that disorder. Compared with patients with nonpsychotic depression, those with psychotic depression have depressive symptoms that are individually more severe. They also are more likely to have hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity and increased ventricular-to-brain ratios. The short- and long-term outcomes for such patients are poor. Findings that this prognostic disadvantage may be permanent and that psychotic features recur at high rates in subsequent episodes indicate that these symptoms in major depressive disorder have a lifelong significance. Although monotherapy with antidepressants may be effective, recovery is more rapid when antidepressants are combined with antipsychotics. Electroconvulsive therapy is particularly effective for psychotic depression. The importance of combination therapy for prophylaxis is unknown.",

A brief history of the SCT construct is provided, followed by a review of the current research supporting SCT as distinct from ADHD and other psychopathologies. SCT is positively associated with ADHD inattentive symptoms, depression, anxiety, and daytime sleepiness, but is unassociated or negatively associated with externalizing behaviours such as hyperactivity-impulsivity, oppositionality, and aggression. A growing body of research also demonstrates that SCT is uniquely associated with poorer functioning in various domains of major life activities, including academic difficulties (including poor organization, homework problems, and lower grade point average), social problems (especially peer withdrawal and isolation), and emotion dysregulation. SCT is less clearly associated with most neuropsychological performance outcomes with the possible exceptions of sustained attention, processing speed, and motor speed.",

The psychotic symptoms in epilepsy share some qualities with schizophrenic psychosis, such as positive symptoms of paranoid delusions and hallucinations. Psychotic syndromes in epilepsy are most common but not exclusively associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. De Novo psychosis following epilepsy surgery is rare. Forced normalization—psychosis associated with dramatic reduction of epileptiform activity or seizures is described in small series only. Ictal and postictal psychosis can be prevented with seizure control, but postictal and chronic interictal psychoses require multidisciplinary and psychopharmacologic management.",

The patients complied with the international consensus criteria for AS and were consecutively investigated for psychomotor development, epilepsy, and electroencephalogram (EEG) profiles.The median age at diagnosis was 3.9 years. The motor milestones were delayed. Median developmental quotient level was 26. All patients but 1 experienced predominantly polymorphic seizures. In 4 cases, the epilepsy was refractory to treatment. The EEG of all patients displayed an abnormal sleep pattern and generalized abnormalities, with a maximum over the posterior areas.Milder or less typical phenotypes of AS may remain undiagnosed, leading to an overall underdiagnosis of the disease. The EEG shows no clear relation to genotype, clinical picture, or to the presence and severity of epilepsy. AS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with severe cryptogenic epilepsy and a characteristic configuration of clinical features.",

It must be remembered that not in all cases the same combination of symptoms occur as it is considered to schizophrenia as a heterogeneous disorder.

There is no correlation whatsoever between epilepsy (understood as a clinical phenomenon, which it is, and not as an abnormal EEG) and LKS; most patients with both LKS and seizures have a very mild form of epilepsy and readily respond to antiepileptic drug therapy. 2.

Although it characterized by significant severity of clinical state and resistance to psychopharmacotherapy, and may be accompanied by high social risks. Objectives To carry out clinical and psychopathological differentiation of DSPS and to define its personalized diagnostic and prognostic criteria. Methods 66 patients with DSPS were observed (F20.0, F20.01, F20.02 according to ICD-10) by psychopathological, psychometrical and statistical methods. Results Persistent delusional conviction of patient in invasion of certain «spiritual being» (demonic or divine) inside of the body and soul is the specific core of DSPS. The psychotic episode with DSPS has similar pattern with paranoid syndrome of Kandinsky–Clérambault. Although, the structure of the syndrome is varying, and characterized by predominance of hallucinatory or delusion symptoms. According to these varieties two different types of DSPS were identified, which were observed in continuous or paroxysmal course of disease. The forms of destructive delusional behavior were also different for both of these types. Conclusions Delusional Syndrome of Possession in schizophrenia (DSPS) is complex and diverse phenomenon, due to religious content of delusional disorders, which occurs in specific psychopathological structure of psychotic state. This fact may cause controversy both in psychiatric practice and in religious communities. So, the obtained data could be important for social and treatment predicting, as well as for pastoral counseling. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

This paper reviews the characteristics of non-cognitive behaviors in several types of dementia.",

Symptoms of grief include physical and psychological changes including body aches, anxiety, and emotional pain. Grief has been conceptualized both as a series of stages or phases and as a period of meaning‐making. Furthermore, a variety of factors related to characteristics of the griever, the nature of the loss, and available support may influence grief processes and health outcomes. When grief becomes particularly distressing or prolonged, individuals can experience complicated grief, which is tied to more negative grief outcomes. Individuals with stronger support networks may experience improved health effects during bereavement.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "abstract": "3 cases with chronic methamphetamine psychoses (MAP-P) were studied from the clinical psychiatric point of view and discussed: 1.) The average time of occurrence of psychotic symptoms in our 3 cases after beginning of MAP abuse was two or three years. 2.) Although the psychotic states (often schizophrenia-like) were stable for a short time, the symptoms recurred promptly after reinjection of a small amount of MAP, unspecific stress or drinking sake (flashback phenomenon). The recurrence may happen even after several years. 3.) In cases of chronic MAP-P disturbances of consciousness are rare. Chronic process of MAP-P cases may show acute transient disturbances of consciousness (flashback phenomenon). 4.) The change of affects and behaviour ranges between irritable and indifferent attitudes. While there are close connections between the disturbance of feeling and change of personality (Wesensänderung), it is very difficult to decide whether premorbid character traits are dominant or there is a change of personality or emotional disturbance. 5.) About acute psychic symptoms which are responsible for recurrence of MAP-P, MAP-abusers make the experience that their intimate personal affairs are overlooked and become public (uncovered defensive experiences). In chronic cases of MAP-P we often meet patients with hypertrophic self-feeling or delusion of grandeur predominant in the symptomatology. 6.) In our cases sensations were amalgamated into each other and there were hallucinatory experiences without clear division between them. 7.) In chronic cases the auditory hallucinations criticized or censured the patients for their behaviour. Thought echoing (Gedankenlautwerden) was found. We found signs of mind reading (Gedankenausbreitung).",

      "title": "Young and exhausted",
      "abstract": "To the Editor,Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, multisystem and often debilitating disorder of unknown etiology. (1) It is a complicated disease characterized by at least six months (in pediatrics 3 months) of extreme fatigue that is not alleviated by rest and a group of other symptoms that are constant for a period of time. (1)Post-exertional malaise (PEM) and delayed recovery are core symptoms and the most useful when making a diagnosis. (2) PEM involves a constellation of substantially disabling signs and symptoms that occur in response to physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual over-exertion. (2) The diagnosis of CFS/ME relies on the typical clinical presentation and the exclusion of other causes of fatigue. Up until now there was no test to confirm the diagnosis of CFS/ME. The two-day cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is becoming a new diagnostic method that can be used in case of suspicion of CFS/ME in attempt to evaluate presence of PEM. (4) This test, used in centres for patients with CFS/ME, has not yet published any data in pediatrics to support its use.We present a case of a 13-year-old patient with chronic debilitating fatigue who meets the criteria for CFS/ME. The patient was examined in detail by a pediatrician (anamnestic unclear cause, resting tachycardia in the physical examination, laboratory tests within normal limits), endocrinologist (normal hormonal profile for a given age, Tanner stage 3), infectologist (serology for typical viruses negative), psychologist (normal cognitive functions). For a history of resting tachycardia, the patient was examined by a cardiologist where no cardiogenic cause of fatigue was demonstrated, sinus tachycardia was present, and the patient was recommended head-up-tilt test, which showed the presence of postural orthostatic tachycardia. Due to the idiopathic nature of the difficulties and the excluded secondary cause, a two-day protocol examination by cardiopulmonary exercise testing was indicated. Written consent was taken and documented. Before the examination, we performed resting spirometry (physiological findings), resting ECG (sinus tachycardia) and a shortened Schellong test with a tachycardic response to orthostasis immediately after standing up and after 3 minutes of standing. Subsequently, standard CPET using treadmill (Itam, Poland) with individualized protocol with progressive increase in workload until exhaustion and breath-by-breath analysis of exhaled gases (Geratherm, Germany) was performed. On the first day, basal values were determined, the patient subjectively tolerated the examination well, the exercise ended prematurely due to subjective fatigue and a feeling of lack of air. On the second day, under the same conditions, the CPET was repeated, during which the patient also terminated the exercise prematurely but a half minute later than on the first day (exercise duration 6:32 min vs. 7:00 min; peak work rate 3,26W/kg vs. 3,68W/kg; peak VO2 34,5 ml/kg/min vs. 36,5 ml/kg/min). Using this methodology, patient did not meet diagnostic criteria for PEM and subsequently CFS/ME (decrease in monitored values on the second day of the examinations). In both days, during exercise, a bizarre pattern of respiration with malposition of the respiratory act to the large airways was observed by observing the flow-volume loop. Analysis of the respiratory pattern identified an erratic respiratory pattern (figure 1A) with low resting ETCO2 (26mmHg) and tachypnoea at maximal workload with dominant ventilation of dead space (figure 1B, 1C, 1G). The consequence of this pattern of respiration is a chronic state of hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis, which is metabolically compensated in the patient. Fatigue and increased heart rate are expected clinical manifestations. Respiratory rehabilitation was recommended to the patient in order to fixate the correct breathing patterns (diaphragmatic breathing) and psychological guidance. The patient was subsequently retested 3 months after the start of physiotherapy and psychotherapy at the request of the parents. Retesting showed significant improvements in the monitored parameters (figure 1G) as well as in the clinical condition of the patient. The patient’s overall fitness increased, an adequate resting respiratory pattern was present (figure 1D), normal resting ETCO2 (36mmHg), ventilatory efficiency was adjusted (figure 1F, 1G), and the patient reported a subjective increase in energy. Prior to the examination, we performed a Schellong test on the patient, in which there were no signs of postural orthostatic tachycardia.Dysfunctional breathing (DB) is a condition of the airways characterized by an irregular breathing pattern and changes in the airways that cannot be attributed to a specific diagnosis and that causes respiratory and non-respiratory problems. (3) It is not a disease process, but rather changes in respiratory patterns that disrupt normal respiratory processes. However, DB can coexist with diseases such as bronchial asthma or heart disease. The main symptom is shortness of breath or air hunger, associated with non-respiratory symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, cervical spine pain or fatigue. (5) It also plays a role in chronic fatigue, neck and back pain, fibromyalgia, and some aspects of anxiety and depression. (5)The most common type of DB is hyperventilation syndrome, which is defined as respiration exceeding metabolic requirements, reducing blood carbon dioxide concentrations below normal values. (3) This changes the pH of the blood, increases the alkalinity and thus triggers a number of adaptive changes that cause symptoms. These conditions are non-somatic in nature and their treatment consists of respiratory rehabilitation by various techniques (diaphragmatic breathing, Feldenkrais method, Buteyko method, Pilates) and psychotherapy in order to control impulsive changes in the respiratory pattern in various situations. (5)CPET confirmed the presence of DB in the patient based on the low resting value of ETCO2, the presence of a chaotic pattern of respiration during resting and exercise with the presence of tachypnoea (with very low ventilatory efficiency) in maximal exertion. Diagnosis of DB using CPET is one of the methods of DB diagnostics. Proper respiratory rehabilitation and psychological guidance resulted in the patient fixing the respiratory pattern and subsequently eliminating the primary cause of the examination - chronic fatigue. Patients with CFS/ME are a common pediatric problem. The current possibilities of diagnostics are enriched by the possibility of performing CPET which can be a benefit in differential diagnostics as well as in confirming the diagnosis.",

The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD is about 2.5% of the population. The rates in men and women are equal. The mean age of onset is in the mid-to-late twenties to early thirties, and it is slightly earlier in males´ population. OCD has two fundamental phenomenological characteristics: repetitive urges of thoughts or actions which patients experience as coming from their own mind but as alien to their will; and surges of unbearable anxiety which accompany either resistance to these compulsions or exposure to objects or thoughts which trigger the repetitive behaviour or cognitions. The cultural influence on the content of the obsessions has been noted in the epidemiological studies. The familial nature of OCD has been observed since several years and recent studies have provided limited evidence for the importance of genetic factors in the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Recent studies suggest gender-related clinical differences in the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most prevalent obsession is concerned with contamination by dirt and/or germs. Washing is the accompanying compulsion and such patients may spend several hours daily washing their hands or cleaning their clothes. There are two main approaches to the treatment of OCD: psychological treatment and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants afford a successful treatments for OCD but only those with potent effects on the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems appear to have antiobsessional efficacy.",

      "abstract": "The longitudinal association of several syndromal diagnoses is very frequently a direct consequence of modern descriptive diagnosis. Comorbidity in this sense is clinically relevant. Comorbid cases are more severe, are more amenable to treatment and are more frequently suicidal. The level of association between psychiatric syndromes can lead to nosologic hypotheses that can be further examined by independent investigations, and especially by means of family studies. Generalized anxiety disorders are very closely associated with the affective disorders, particularly with depressions and suicide attempts, but also with hypomania. There is no close relationship with panic disorder. Social phobias are highly associated with agoraphobia, but also with simple phobia; also with panic, obsessive-compulsive syndromes and substance abuse. The prevalence of obsessive-compulsive syndromes depends to an exceptional degree on the definition. Syndromes below the diagnostic threshold of DSM-III are extremely frequent, and longitudinally a fluctuation about this threshold is apparent. OCS are especially found to be associated with social phobia and agoraphobia as well as with dysthymia and recurrent brief depression, but less with major depression.",

      "title": "Phenomenology and psychiatric origin of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) is a sudden change in a person's behavior, perception, thinking, or feeling that is usually time limited and resembles, or is mistaken for, epilepsy but does not have the characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that accompanies a true epileptic seizure [1]. It is considered that PNES is a somatic manifestation of mental distress, in response to a psychological conflict or other Stressors [2]. A wide spectrum of clinical presentation includes syncope, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, simple and complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure, frontal lobe seizures and status epilepticus [3]. Coexistence of epilepsy and PNES is seen in approximately 9% of cases [5]. Between 25-30% of patients referred to tertiary centers and initially diagnosed as refractory epilepsy were on further examination diagnosed as PNES [6,7]. In DSM-IV [12] PNES are usually categorized under conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions. However, psychiatric basis of PNES may be anxiousness (panic attack), somatization or factitious disorder, simulation, dissociative disorders and psychosis [1]. AIM The aim of the study was to establish clinical phenomenology and EEG characteristics as well as basic psychiatric disorder in patients with PNES. METHOD In a retrospective study covering the period from January 1st 1999 till April 31 st 2003, 24 patients (22 female, 2 male) treated at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade were analyzed. PNES were defined as sudden change in behavior incoherent with epileptiform activity registered on EEG. Possible PNES were determined on the basis of history data and clinical examination during the attack but definitive confirmation was established only by the finding of no ictal EEG changes during typical seizure of each patient. Patients with coexisting epilepsy were included in the study, too. At least two standard EEG (range 2-6, median 4) were performed at the beginning of diagnostic evaluation. Demographic data, clinical presentation (apparent loss of consciousness, type of convulsion and associated clinical signs) and placebo-induced seizures (administration of saline near the cubital vein) with EEG or video-EEG monitoring were analyzed. Basic psychiatric disorder was classified according to DSM IV classification criteria. RESULTS Duration of PNES was 4.7 years (range from 2 months to 30 years). The time from onset to the diagnosis of PNES was 4.5 years. Epilepsy comorbidity was diagnosed in 9 patients (37.5%). The average time of use of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the group of isolated PNES was 2.4 years and 20% of patients were treated with two or more AED. The vast majority of patients presented with bilateral convulsions (54.16%) with apparent loss of consciousness found in 91.6% of cases. Ictal iwury (16.7%), tongue bite (4.2%) and premonition of the seizure (17.4%) were uncommon. Variability in clinical presentation of seizures was found in over half of patients (57%). Psychological trigger could be determined in over 60% of patients. EEG findings in a group with isolated PNES suggesting the existence of epileptiform activity was found in one case. EEG monitoring of placebo-induced seizure was performed in 20 patients, of whom 19 (95%) showed typical habitual attack with no electroclinical correlate. In 70% of cases conversion disorder DSM-IV criteria were fulfilled. Somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder were found in 3 patients. The diagnosis of factitious disorder was made in one case and only two patients were undiagnosed according to DSM-IV. DISCUSSION Average delay from onset to diagnosis of PNES in larger studies was estimated to be approximately 7 years [8]. Even though diagnostic delay in our study was shorter, organizational reasons for this could not be found. Longer duration of a typical attack (compared to the epileptic seizure), apparent loss of consciousness, bilateral convulsion behavior and significant clinical variability in absence of typical epileptic elements such as tongue bite and ictal iwury could be the main clinical manifestation of PNES. We found rare interictal abnormalities (6.7%) in the group with isolated PNES and significant percentage (77.7%) in patients with coexisting epilepsy which is coherent with other reports [8]. The latest could lead to prolonged delay in appropriate diagnosis and suitable treatment. Clear psychological trigger wasn't noted in whole group of patients (61 %). This, however, is not unusual since PNES represents a chronic disorder with repeated triggering that could lead to less significant role of the same psychological trigger in developed PNES. Even insufficiently resolved in ethical terms, placebo-induced procedure was of huge sensitivity. In clinical practice conversion disorder is hard to differ from malingering or implementation of secondary gain. One could make the conclusion only on the basis of detailed and careful estimation of the symptoms developing context Conversion disorder is more prevalent among women (from 2:1 to 10:1) [4, 13] but modest percentage of affected men could be explained only by limited sample in this study. CONCLUSION PNES is often replaced with epilepsy and in number of cases clinical differentiation is not easy. One should be acquainted with clinical presentation of PNES as well as its psychiatric origin in order to adequately recognize and treat the disorder.",

      "abstract": "In Factitious Disorders, the patient exaggerates, fabricates, simulates, and/or induces symptoms of medical and/or psychiatric illnesses—in himself or in another person—with no concrete incentive beyond the pleasure, consolation, or status conferred by being a patient (or by being closely identified with a patient). This condition can go unrecognized for years, as most physicians assume that descriptions of medical symptoms are presented in good faith. Variations have sometimes been termed factitious disorder imposed on another or Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The secretive and sometimes criminal nature of these behaviors provides numerous barriers to research, but important data have been collected. After discussing the available research base of the factitious disorders, potential assessment procedures using medical records are detailed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Tourette's Disorder (TD), also known as Tourette syndrome, is characterized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) by the presence of multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics beginning prior to age 18 and continuing for at least one year or longer. Although the motor and vocal tics do not need to occur concurrently, the tics need to occur several times a day or more nearly every day or intermittently with no tic‐free interval of more than 3 months for the diagnosis to be given. Motor tics are defined as sudden, rapid, repetitive, stereotyped muscle movements, and vocal tics are similarly rapid and spontaneous vocalizations or repetitive sounds. Motor and vocal tics can be further categorized as simple or complex. Simple motor tics are brief, seemingly insignificant movements involving one muscle location, for example a hard eye blink, shoulder shrug, head tilt, nose twitch, and/or facial grimace. Simple vocal tics are monosyllabic, usually meaningless sounds, such as grunting, throat clearing, sniffing, and/or coughing. Complex tics are longer in duration, can be mistaken as voluntary and purposeful, and involve the coordination of multiple muscle groups, for example spinning, jumping, bending, kicking, touching self or objects, and facial or hand gestures. Complex vocal tics include interpretable noises, such as barking, shouting, or chirping, as well as vocalizations, such as words, phrases, repetition of self (palilalia) or others (echolalia). Coprolalia (e.g., profane language), often thought to be a defining symptom of TD, is quite rare, occurring in only about 10% of cases.",

Two boys had episodes of abnormal behavior in hypnagogic-and occasionally hypnopompic-periods for 1 year from the time they were 1 year and several months old. The episodes consisted of irregular body movements, which could be either gentle or violent but never made the children get out of bed. They lasted from a few seconds to 2 hours and were associated with poor reactivity and amnesia of the events. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed wake-state features, with brief bursts of hypnagogic hypersynchrony, and did not display seizure activity. A distinctive behavior disorder occurring during wake-sleep transitions with a wake EEG pattern has been identified in very early childhood. The clinical profile does not fit any of the known parasomnias and might belong to a new category of parasomnia.",

An unanticipated opportunity for King David to peep at Bathsheba led him to a train of Biblical woes and Nathan's rebuke. According to old lore, Tom's peeping at Lady Godiva led God to blind him. The stories of King David and Tom are presented as examples of “sinful,” not pathological, behavior. Neither story provides enough details to permit a diagnosis of voyeurism for either man. Voyeurism as a diagnosis came later. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), voyeurism requires more than isolated episodes of peeping. The DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of voyeurism has three criteria; (1) The patient must have recurrent sexual fantasies, urges, or acts of observing an unsuspecting person naked, in the process of undressing, or having sex; (2) The patient must have had these recurrent fantasies, urges, and acts for at least six months; and (3) Either the patient has engaged in peeping or, if not, is having personal or interpersonal difficulties as a result of voyeuristic interests.",

      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

      "abstract": "SIR–In their recent article1 Kim and Park fail to deal with the entirety of Dr Lance’s classical definition of spasticity.2 His carefully drafted statement documented the consensus of the 1979 symposium of 44 actively engaged neurological investigators (including me): ‘Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (‘muscle tone’) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. This did not preclude discussion of other features of the upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from release of flexor reflexes, such as flexor spasms, or the negative symptoms such as the pattern of weakness and loss of dexterity caused by withdrawal of the influence of descending motor pathways.’2 Thus spasticity is not a subjective symptom like headache or diplopia. It is rather an objective observation of the professional examination, like a cardiac murmur or a dilated pupil. There is abundant evidence that the truly disabling negative symptoms, often more impaired dexterity than strength, are directly correlated with the degree of disconnection of the target motor neuron population from the complexly integrated control of forebrain and hindbrain nerve structures. This loss of fine control and force is neither augmented by antagonist muscle stretch reflexes3 or improved by systemic medication, fusimotor blockade,4 or dorsal rhizotomy.5 Nor is the degree of clumsiness directly correlated with the prevalence of spasticity.6 The Ashworth Scale has never been more than an amateur parascientific game, with personal impressions of stiffness and absent replicable physical parameters. Recently, Fleuren et al. 7 have gone to the trouble of proving that the Ashworth Scale is worthless. Occam’s razor requires cessation of the senseless and useless demonization of the spasticity epiphenomenon. Absent evidence-based potions, patients should be assisted to practice toward maximal autonomous function.",

Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a collection of physical, cognitive, and affective symptoms causing clinically significant distress or interference that occur in the 7 days prior to the onset of menses, after which they become minimal or absent. The diagnosis is established by symptom documentation using a validated, reliable tool such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for at least 2 menstrual cycles to confirm the timing of relevant symptoms. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there is a 1.8%-5.8% 12-month prevalence of PMDD among menstruating women1; however, the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms causing clinically significant interference or distress but not meeting full criteria for a diagnosis of PMDD may be as high as 13%-18%.",

Negative symptoms should be evaluated in a relation to positive symptoms both cross-sectionally and long term (prospectively/retrospectively). Two types of long-term interaction between negative and positive symptoms could be distinguished: (1) relatively synchronized, and (2) relatively desynchronized. Synchronization of negative and positive symptoms is characterized by their unidirectional long-term course. Desynchronization is characterized by their bidirectional long-term relations: (1) negative schizophrenia with minimal positive symptoms at the beginning of the disease and further progression of negative symptoms; or (2) schizophrenia with negative symptoms ‘that stopped at the very beginning’, and the later course is characterized by positive symptoms. Considering every single time point of the long-term relationship between negative and positive symptoms (cross-sectionally), the chapter describes the concept of ‘mutual/common syndromes’ (consisting of both positive and negative symptoms) at different stages of schizophrenia, including residual deficit states.",

      "title": "Chronic fatigue syndrome: it's tiring not knowing much—an in-depth review for occupational health professionals",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an incredibly common symptom in medical settings. In the Office of National Statistics Survey 2000 (1), a degree of limiting fatigue was reported by 27% of working-age adults. Although it is claimed that about three-quarters of these patients in primary care go on to develop chronic symptoms, this is at odds with the reported point prevalence of only up to 3%. The vast majority of this fatigue falls within the 'medically unexplained' (2) category yet does not meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Even those that might do are often not diagnosed as such by physicans (3). As Ranjith ((4), this issue) demon- strates, there are several sets of different diagnostic criteria that make this difficult area even more complex. A primary agreement seems to be the requirement for the fatigue to have lasted for 6 months or more and to be associated with a substantial degree of impairment. It is this impairment that is the primary reason for occu- pational health involvement. Further symptoms must co- occur with the fatigue over the 6 month period (impaired memory or concentration, sore throat, tender glands, aching or stiff muscles, post-exertional fatigue, multi-joint pain, unrefreshing sleep and new headaches), although the actual number required fluctuates. Other clinically important physical causes preclude diagnosis, as do underlying serious psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. The common co-morbidity with anxiety and depression does not rule out the diagnosis and has complicated research, treatment and policy. A lot of published work covers either less severe conditions or those with shorter duration. These con- ditions receive labels such as 'chronic-fatigue like syndrome' or 'idiopathic chronic fatigue'.

      "title": "The psychiatric and neurological interface of multiple sclerosis: case report and literature review",
      "abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder that affects 2.5 million people worldwide. MS exemplifies the interface between neurology and psychiatry in a trajectory of neuro and psycho-pathologies that can conflate with the diagnosis of primary psychotic disorders. The protean nature of its neuropsychiatric manifestations could delay the diagnosis and management of such a challenging condition. Case Presentation: We present the case of a 52-year-old female who developed first episode of psychosis at the age of 48 years. There was no history of previous mental illness in either the patient, or in any family member. She had been formally diagnosed with a relapsing and remitting type of MS, at the age of 30 years. Six years later, she discontinued the recommended disease modifying therapy (DMT) which resulted in worsening of her MS and late onset schizophrenia-like symptoms. Her affect, however, was warm and interactive, and she exhibited a sense of general wellbeing and serenity, describing her psychosis as being “magical” despite the severity of her condition. Treatment of her psychiatric condition with depot psychotropic medication resulted in dramatic improvement of her psychosis with regain of insight, hence compliance on DMT and containment of her MS. Conclusion: Comorbid psychiatric and MS manifestations may be challenging regarding the diagnosis and management of either condition. Professionals in these fields, therefore, need to be aware of the relative high prevalence of mental health disorders in MS patients and that these may pre or post-date the diagnosis of MS, with the potential to confound the clinical picture.",

      "abstract": "Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by severe headache and diffuse segmental intracranial arterial constriction that resolve within three months. Stroke, which is the major complication of RCVS, can result in persistent neurological disability, and rarely causes death. Diagnosis of RCVS early in the clinical course might improve outcomes. Although recurrent thunderclap headache is the clinical hallmark of RCVS, the absence of such a pattern should not lead to discard the diagnosis. Our literature review shows that RCVS can also manifest as an unspecific headache, such as a single severe headache episode, a mild or a progressive headache. Moreover, a subset of patients with severe RCVS presents without any headache, but frequently with seizures, focal neurological deficits, confusion or coma, in the setting of stroke or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. These patients may be aphasic or in comatose state, explaining their inability to give their own medical history. They may have forgotten the headache they had a few days before more dramatic symptoms, or may have a variant of the classical RCVS. By consequence, an RCVS should be suspected in patients with any unusual headache, whether thunderclap or not, and in patients with cryptogenic stroke or convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage, whether the patient also has headache or not. Diagnosis in such cases relies on the demonstration of reversible multifocal intracranial arterial stenosis and the exclusion of other causes.",

      "abstract": "Literature from the turn of the 20th Century to the present suggests that obsessive-compulsive symptoms occur among persons with schizophrenia at rates that far exceed what is found among persons not suffering from psychoses. Less clear, however, is the significance of those symptoms. Are obsessive-compulsive symptoms, for instance, related to other aspects of schizophrenia or do they represent another isolated dimension of distress? To address this issue, a review of studies is presented that explores the relationships between obsessive-compulsive symptoms; positive, negative and depressive symptoms; psychosocial dysfunction; and neurocognitive deficits. Results are interpreted as indicating that obsessive-compulsive symptoms are linked with graver impairments in psychosocial function. Regarding the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and neurocognition, results from across a broad range of studies are equivocal. A review of studies of pharmacological treatments for obsessive-compulsive symptoms has also failed to produce consistent results. While some agents have been found to lead to improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, other studies suggest that these medications may exacerbate those same symptoms. In general, it appears that, at best, there are currently few effective treatments. Directions for future research are reviewed. Recommendations include the development of tailored psychological and psychopharmacological interventions, and the implementation of longitudinal studies sensitive to the possibility that there are qualitatively distinct groups of patients with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.",

The idiopathic dementias are those in which etiology is assumed to be found within the brain itself. The main subgroup is Alzheimer-type dementia. The vascular dementias are those in which the blood supply to the brain is insufficient. Multi-infarct dementia (MID) is the prototype.

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

      "abstract": "espanolSe describe la evolucion de las diferentes formas de angustia de una paciente (P) con ataques de panico, durante los siete anos del proceso psicoanalitico. Se considera inicialmente a P como con una organizacion fronteriza de la personalidad. Ella vivia su adolescencia alterada con predominio de la posicion esquizoparanoide; padecia de narcisismo patologico; sufria de agorafobia, ataques de panico y somatizaciones como consecuencia, principalmente, de una insufi ciente separacion-individuacion y de una simbiosis patologica con su madre primitiva. Su angustia de separacion, que inducia a veces ataques de panico y somatizaciones, se re-actualizaba repetitivamente en transferencia y se elaboro durante los primeros anos. Esos y otros sintomas disminuyeron su intensidad paulatinamente, y luego desaparecieron o dejaron de ser una preocupacion. Con el proposito de buscar convergencias, suplementos y divergencias en las teorias, se revisan las conceptualizaciones construidas sobre las diferentes formas de angustias. Las de P corresponden mas a las pre-edipicas que a las de las posiciones posteriores. Varias formas de angustia se relacionan con re-vivencias traumaticas o se producen por anticiparlas y, eventualmente, para evitar estas vivencias desbordantes. Efectivamente, P no ha vivido solamente una separacion traumatica de su madre cuando tenia seis anos, sino que se infi ere haber padecido tambien traumas negativos y acumulativos. Esas vivencias traumaticas no le habian permitido la construccion de un self sufi cientemente cohesivo ni una separacion-individuacion sufi ciente que le permitieran elaborar su adolescencia. Entonces P vivia en angustias permanentes que le precipitaban facilmente en ataques de panico y somatizaciones ante las situaciones de separacion de su madre primitiva-analista. Su angustia de separacion y sus ataques de panico eran tambien los factores de su angustia de muerte y de su insomnio. EnglishThe evolution of the different forms of anxiety of a patient (P) with panic attacks is described during seven years of the psychoanalytic process. The P is considered initially like a borderline organization of the personality. She was living her adolescence altered with predominance of the schizoparanoid position; was suffering of pathological narcissism, agoraphobia, panic attacks and somatisations as consequences, mainly, of an insuffi cient separation-individuation and a pathological symbiosis with her primitive mother. Her anxieties of separation that was inducing, sometimes, panic attacks and somatisations, were reedited repetitively in transference and were elaborated during the fi rst years. Those and other symptoms diminished gradually of intensity, and disappeared or they stopped being a preoccupation. In order to look for convergences, supplementations and divergences in the theories, are reviewed the conceptualisations constructed on the different forms of anxiety. The anxieties of P correspond more to the pre-oedipus anxieties that to those of the later positions. Several forms of anxieties are related to reliving traumatic experiences or they take place to anticipate them and to possibly avoid these overfl owing experiences. Indeed, the P has not only lived one traumatic separation from her mother when she was six years old, but it is inferred that she has also suffered negative and cumulative traumas. Those traumatic experiences had not allowed to the construction of a self suffi ciently cohesive nor a suffi cient separation-individuation that could allow the elaboration of her adolescence. Then the P was living in permanent anxiety that was precipitating easily her panic attacks and somatisations in the presence of the situations of separation of her mother primitive-analyst. Her anxiety of separation and her panic attacks were also the factors of her anxiety of death and insomnia.",

Gejala non motorik PP diantaranya adalah gangguan neuropsikiatri seperti depresi, psikosis, ansietas. Kami melaporkan sebuah kasus PP dengan gejala psikotik berupa halusinasi yang jarang dijumpai. Laporan Kasus: Pasien perempuan berusia 74 tahun terdiagnosis Parkinson sejak lebih dari 20 tahun, dibawa ke rumah sakit dengan bicara tidak nyambung, adanya halusinasi visual, dan emosi yang tidak stabil sejak 1 bulan. Keluarga pasien juga merasa sejak 6 bulan terakhir pasien menjadi sering lupa. Pasien dengan riwayat PP tidak rutin mengkonsumsi obat parkinson di bawah supervisi dokter. Keluhan halusinasi pernah dirasakan 2 tahun lalu namun membaik setelah perawatan. Diskusi: Gejala non motorik dapat dijumpai seiring perkembangan penyakit Parkinson dandapat diidentifikasi sebelum sindrom motor muncul. Adanya gejala psikosis berupa halusinasi dalam kasus yang dipaparkan terhadi setelah 18 tahun sejak pasien terdiagnosis, dimana berdasarkan hasil studi terdahulu dilaporkan 60% penderita PP berkembang adanya halusinasi atau delusi setelah 12 tahun perawatan dan pada usia lebih tua saat onset PP. Gangguan kognitif pada PP juga dicurigai dalam kasus walau belum sepenuhnya dapat ditegakan serta adanya gangguan tidur pada PP dengan prevalensi 40-90% dijumpai pada kasus yang kami laporkan. Kesimpulan: Manifestasi non motorik PP yang mencakup gejala neuropsikiatri sangat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup pasien maupun keluarga dan perawat pasien.

      "abstract": "A 2-year-old, developmentally normal, boy presented with multiple seizure-like events over 10 days. These episodes were described as brief (20–30 s), vacant stares, associated with impaired awareness, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, tongue thrusts, and pallor of the face and body. A few episodes exhibited tonic posturing of the upper limbs [Figure 1 and https://links.lww.com/IPCR/A7]. Other aspects of history were normal. There was no dysmorphism or neurocutaneous markers. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (epilepsy protocol) was normal. The drug-induced sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominance [Figure 2]. A diagnosis of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures (SeLEAS) or \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" was made, based on semiology and EEG findings. Seizures stopped within 72 h of starting sodium valproate.Figure 1: The seizure semiology was a vacant stare with impaired awareness associated with hypersalivation, retching, vomiting and tongue thrusting, and pallor of the face and body, lasting for 20–30 s. There was no postictal drowsinessFigure 2: The interictal sleep electroencephalogram record shows frequent sharp wave, spike and slow wave (1–3 Hz, 300–500 microvolt) discharges arising from O1 and O2 with spread to adjacent electrodes, accentuated during photic stimulation. There are independent frequent sharp wave discharges from F3, F4, P3, and FP3 suggestive of multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominanceSeLEAS is a relatively frequent, benign epileptic syndrome characterized by predominant autonomic symptoms and/or focal onset motor seizures. The former include retching, emesis, changes in color (pallor, flushing, or cyanosis), pupillary dilatation, hypersalivation, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory alterations.[1] Clinicians should be aware of this entity as these events are frequently misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis.[2] Interictal EEG shows occipital spikes. Multifocal spikes with high amplitude sharp-slow wave complexes can also occur at various locations. Seizures will stop in most children within 2–3 years of the first episode. The risk of developing epilepsy in adulthood is similar to the general population. Anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbamazepine, valproate, and levetiracetam) are indicated when seizure frequency is high.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A subtle behavioural or cognitive manifestation of epilepsy can be defined in two ways. First, epileptiform discharges not presenting as obvious seizures may nevertheless affect cognition and/or behaviour. Second, the actual seizures may be obvious but the way they affect cognition or behaviour may not be. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the epileptiform discharges in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes can affect behaviour and cognition. The focal discharges in other forms of epilepsy can also be associated with behavioural change. The Landau‐Kleffner syndrome, the CSWS syndrome, transitory cognitive impairment and transient epileptic amnesia provide further examples of cognitive and behavioural manifestations resulting from subtle manifestations of the epilepsy. Prompt, effective antiepileptic treatment with medication or surgery can improve behaviour and cognition in at least some cases.",

The epileptic malady, when so originated, throws almost into the shade the other constitutional accidents, or sequels of the syphilitic infection, if they are not—as it often happens—in suspension or latency. The first point, therefore, to be considered before we proceed to the description of its characters, is—at what stage of syphilis does the neurosis commonly occur, or rather, is there a secondary and a tertiary epilepsy, distinct from each other, as is held by Fournier, who judges it difficult to connect the former, principally exhibited by females, like a transient specific neurosis, with any lesion of the nervous centres; whereas the latter should be, on the contrary, manifestly consecutive to encephalic lesions, thus constituting one of the manifold expressions of that complex organic state known as cerebral syphilis.",

In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, second edition (ICSD-2) (1), a diagnosis of insomnia must confirm both the existence of nocturnal symptoms and a clinically significant impact during the patient's waking state. Nocturnal symptoms include difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, early awakening, and interrupted or nonrestorative sleep. Daytime symptoms include distress about poor nocturnal sleep and impairment in any role function or other aspects of overall well-being. Researchers have traditionally used quantitative criteria to diagnose insomnia, but these criteria have not been standardized. Quantitative criteria for the frequency and duration of total wake time and/or total sleep time have been proposed (2), but these criteria have not been uniformly employed.",

Realizar un repaso breve de las entidades que presentan demencia como sintoma principal ademas de sindrome parkinsoniano en diferente medida. Desarrollo. Entre los sindromes con demencia y parkinsonismo asociado se encuentran numerosas patologias muy heterogeneas tanto en frecuencia como en etiologia y pronostico. Algunas son poco frecuentes, como las asociadas a mutaciones del cromosoma 17, y otras son tan comunes como la enfermedad de Alzheimer o la hidrocefalia normotensiva. Tambien se incluyen procesos de diferente etiologia: degenerativa, infecciosa, traumatica, toxica o metabolica, vascular, etc... que pueden, entre otros sintomas, presentar demencia y parkinsonismo.

O termo Esquizofrenia se refere a um grupo de transtornos caracterizados por sintomas psicóticos positivos em algum estágio da doença, em que mania e depressão grave não são características proeminentes ou persistentes, e onde sintomas negativos e cognitivos são proeminentes e associados a um nível variável de incapacidade (McGorry, 2004). Este diagnóstico compreende um grupo heterogêneo de transtornos psicóticos, que resultam, provavelmente, de alterações neurobiológicas substanciais na função cerebral e em algum grau na estrutura cerebral do indivíduo. Originado do conceito kraepeliniano de demência precoce, seu significado sofreu modificações com o desenvolvimento de novas nosologias (McGorry, 2004). Entretanto, apesar da tentativa de unificar as várias apresentações do transtorno, o curso da esquizofrenia revelou-se heterogêneo e notavelmente diferente de quadros neurológicos mais bem tipificados, como a Doença de Alzheimer. O tratamento dessa condição, muitas vezes, pode ser desafiador, o que demanda do psiquiatra uma adaptação às especificidades de cada caso. O presente relato de caso apresenta um quadro refratário às medicações e às medidas preconizadas, sendo necessária a implementação de medidas pouco descritas na literatura para sua estabilização.",

The disorder has a resemblance to many other disorders described in the past including myalgic encephalitis and post-infective fatigue; however, the term itself and the criteria for diagnosing this disorder were first laid out in 1988. The disorder has received attention from a wide range of clinicians and researchers. The mechanism of causation of this disorder has been poorly understood, though biological, psychological and social factors seem to play a role. The disorder causes significant impairment and is highly comorbid with other disorders. Non-pharmacological measures like graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy seem to work better for treatment than pharmacological measures. This narrative review takes an overview of chronic fatigue syndrome from a generalist standpoint and looks into the clinical features, etiopathogenesis and management of this disorder.",

The hallucinations accompanying acute schizophrenia more closely resembled those seen in affective disorder than in chronic schizophrenia, but no type of hallucination was diagnostic in the sense of occurring significantly more often in one illness than in another. Auditory hallucinations occurred almost as often in affective disorder as in schizophrenia; visual hallucinations were common in all five disorders; and derogatory voices, widely believed to signify depression, occurred most often in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Confusion is a non-specific, non-diagnostic term to describe a patient with disorientation, impaired memory, or abnormal thought process. Agitation describes an increased level of psychomotor activity, and anxious or aggressive behaviour. Many agitated patients may also be delirious, yet they only represent a minority of all delirious patients. ICU delirium is an acute cognitive disorder of both consciousness and content of thought. The hallmark of ICU delirium is a fluctuating mental status, inattention, and an altered level of consciousness. Delirium is the end product of a sequence of insults and injury that lead to a common measurable manifestation of end-organ brain injury. It does not have a single aetiology, but often has multiple different and potentially interacting aetiologies. Both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors play important roles in the development of delirium. Importantly, the new onset of delirium should prompt the physician to investigate the underlying cause. Cognitive impairment and age are among the most important non-modifiable risk factors, whereas administration of benzodiazepines is the greatest. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine shows promise as a sedative reducing the risk for delirium when compared with benzodiazepines.",

      "title": "Comparison of Language Disorders in Psychotic Disorder (Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Drug-Induced Psychosis)",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe term refers to many diverse behavioral forms which are not in connection with reality. In other words, the person exhibiting psychotic behavior has weird and extraordinary thoughts and perceptions about whatever happens. Such behavior might include delusions and/or hallucinations (Haljyn and Cross Vytbvrn, 2003). In the 5th statistical and diagnostic manual of psychological disorders, the five principal categories were omitted. The respective categories were labeled as a single class entitled Schizophrenic and Other Psychotic Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2004). Schizophrenia is the most substantial disorder faced by the psychiatry. Schizophrenia mainly turns the most fertile and constructive living years of the patients into inability due to its prevalence age (i.e., early adulthood) and extensive complications (Parva, Mazinani, A'shayeri, and Javadi-Khomami, 2004). The following figures have been reported for prevalence of mental disorders in USA: schizophrenia 1%, schizophrenia form 0.2%, schizoaffective 0.5%, and delusion and joint psychiatric disorder and other psychotic disorders approximately 0.025 per each disease case (Caplan, 1994). Individuals suffering from schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders often exhibit abnormal language damages (Raisi, and Mahmoudi Salmani, 2004) such that speech disturbances are considered among the major symptoms in diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (Vita et al., 1995).Melinder and Barch (2003) described at least two types of language damages (of course, not necessarily separate) in patients suffering from schizophrenia. The first type is thought disorder or failure in maintaining a speech plan which is in turn divided into two branches: formal thought disorder and negative thought disorder. The second type of these damages is schizophrenia which includes variety of traumas such as neologism, incomprehensible speeches or clang association. In formal thought disorder, the speech of the schizophrenic individual has anomalies in semantic rules as well as forming style of language, and, the sentences are obscurely linked. Symptoms like improper repetitions, tangentially, missing the goal, mistake in reference of the pronoun, and neologism are observed in this group. Negative thought disorder is characterized by reduction in syntactic complexities and speech volume. The speech of the patient becomes concise and short such that the vocabulary treasure seems small. This branch of thought disorder differs from disruptions in oral expression, syntactic complexity, and natural hesitations and pauses (Raisi, and Mahmoudi Salmani, 2004). Many unanswered questions have been posed concerning speech and language disorders of psychotic patients. Language is regarded as the most intricate mind product that influences nearly all high-level mind activities i.e., perception, determination, conception, cognition, thought, reasoning, judgment, imagination, problem solving, and even emotions and personality growth. From another aspect, language is the only means to assess major disorder i.e., thought disorder in the respective patients (Parva, Mazinani, A'shayeri, and Javadi-Khomami, 2004). Furthermore, other attitudes consider the major disorder in schizophrenic patients as a language disorder. For instance, CHAIKA in 1974 (quoted by GOURREN 1996) holds the opinion that psychotic patients suffer from an alternating aphasia on which they have no control (Zarrella, 1995). ZAS (1993) believes it is wrong to infer that the respective patients have thought disorder solely based on their language as schizophrenic and psychotic patients- unlike the aphasia patients - have no problem in their expression and in fact the listener has difficulty in understanding their words (Willig, 1998). Language disorders have been popularly recognized from long times ago but such disorders have particularly attracted attraction of psychologists and linguists during the recent decades (Talebi Nejad, 1993). …",

      "title": "Marihuana \"High\": A Model of Senile Dementia?",
      "abstract": "MARIHUANA \"HIGH\": A MODEL OF SENILE DEMENTIA? ADAM SULKOWSKI* The evidence for marihuana-induced brain atrophy [ 1] and \"amotivational syndrome\" [1,2] has not been convincing so far [3-8]. There are, however, some striking similarities between certain features of acute marihuana intoxication and the clinical syndromes of presenile and senile dementia (Alzheimer's disease). These similarities become puzzling and thought provoking when one compares the experimental psychological , neurophysiological, neuropathological, and pharmacological studies of these two, apparently so different, phenomena. Psychological studies of acute intoxication with marihuana of mild to moderate potency have shown no effects on sensory acuity and simple reaction time tests [9-11]. Psychogeriatric literature provides no evidence for motor and/or sensory deficits in early stages of Alzheimer's disease [12, 13]. Careful studies of attention, psychomotor speed, memory and learning in our laboratory [11, 14] have not shown marihuanainduced impairment except for the subjects' ability to use effectively already memorized task-relevant information. We called this deficit a failure in information processing. The same finding has been repeatedly described by many authors in the aged and demented populations [15, 16]. Another intriguing similarity is in self-evaluation regarding one's performance. Under the influence of marihuana—and in contrast to alcohol effects—people tend to perceive their performance as much worse than it is in reality (i.e., they overestimate impairment) and as the result they exercise considerable caution and restraint (Sulkowski, unpublished data). As a matter of fact, in real life, marihuana users are said to occasionally endanger safety by driving too slowly. One needs only to observe daily traffic to see how exasperatingly \"cautious\" elderly people can be. This age-related psychological characteristic has been dealt with extensively by psychologists of old age [17-19].»Bedford VA Medical Center GRECC, 200 Springs Road, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730 and Boston University School of Medicine.© 1980 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/80/2302-0139$01.00 Perspectives in Biology andMedicine · Winter 1980 \\ 209 A unique and reliable effect ofmarihuana is alteration in time perception which has been seen especially clearly in \"time production\" paradigm (e.g., a subject is asked to signal the limits of a 10-second interval of time) [14, 20, 21]. It has been speculated that the drug alters our internal psychological clock. Identical defects in this hypothetical clock have been described in the elderly and have been considered responsible for decrements on many behavioral tests [22, 23]. Some experts contend that the left (dominant) hemisphere functions are more affected by marihuana than the right (nondominant) hemisphere functions [24, 25]. This reportedly results in disinhibition of the right hemisphere and leads to an altered state of consciousness. Recently published neurological theories postulate that this interhemispheric imbalance is responsible for clinical symptoms of dementia [26]. Rigorous tests of these theories are difficult to design [27] and supportive experimental data are very scant. On the psychosocial (interpersonal) level marihuana produces a quiet detached withdrawal from social environment which might be an analogue of so-called gradual social disengagement typical of very old and demented individuals [28]. It is possible that the failure to actively process information when \"high\" reinforces marihuana use through the mechanism of negative reinforcement by protecting the user from stressful cognitive overload with multiple and contradictory messages typical of modern society. Neurophysiological data from EEG studies of marihuana's acute effects show nonspecific and generalized slowing of alpha rhythm and slight to moderate increase in amplitude [29, 30]. These also happen to be the most common findings in very old subjects and patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease [31, 32]. Psychophysiological theorists ofaging have provided some experimental data to support their theory of autonomic nervous system overarousal in the aged and demented [33, 34]. This hyperarousal has been held responsible for interoceptive sensory overload which in turn interfered with CNS adaptive functions. Powerful sympathetic activation is a characteristic and dose-related effect of marihuana. Difficulties with theoretical interpretation notwithstanding, the decrease in cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease has been well documented. Again, there are some preliminary data (L. Miller, personal communication) suggestive of diminished blood supply to the brain in intoxicated marihuana smokers. Pharmacologic studies seem to indicate...",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

      "title": "Neuropsychologic functioning and structural MRI of the brain in patients with schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The first episode of schizophrenia represents a transition from a premorbid to a morbid state. Studying the first episode of schizophrenia is useful since it is devoid of the confounds of chronicity and long-term medication. It is also likely to direct us to the core deficits of the illness. Studies on first-episode schizophrenia suggest a generalized neuropsychologic impairment, but that memory, attention and executive function are more severely impaired. Support for a neurodevelopmental model of neuropsychologic impairment in schizophrenia is derived from the findings that much of the neuropsychologic impairment is present by illness onset, that neuropsychologic impairment remains stable over time and that there is a weak relation between duration of untreated psychosis and neuropsychologic impairment. However, neuropsychologic impairment is moderated by neuroleptic treatment, with some evidence that atypical antipsychotics may have some beneficial effects over conventional antipsychotics. The causal mechanisms of brain abnormality in the temporal and frontal lobes appear to be different to that of neuropsychologic impairment in schizophrenia. The observation that there is a brain volume decrement over time and that the rate of change is higher during the first 5 years would be consistent with a neurodegenerative model of schizophrenia. At the same time, the basal ganglia are vulnerable to volumetric increase secondary to neuroleptic medication. Understanding the roles of the neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative models of schizophrenia is important in deciding intervention strategies.",

An excessive focus on diagnostic criteria for bipolar or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders risks missing this particular set of patients; defined through their dynamic presentation as much as by any cluster of symptoms or types of course. Objectives To explore the concept and relevance of oneroid-like cyclic psychosis through a clinical case and review. Methods We report the case of a 37 year old woman with bipolar disorder (three previous instances of manic episodes with psychotic symptoms) and various gynecological issues that required hormone therapy. After a couple of days having difficulty sleeping, the patient developed a clinical picture consisting of wide and sudden oscillations between hyperactive and inhibited psychomotor activity, moods of dread and ecstasy, and states of disorganized thought and childlike activities with perplexity and mutism. Frequent behaviors as if experiencing visual alucinations and repeated allusions to feeling as if in a dream. These symptoms lasted for 2-3 weeks, after treatment with risperidone and lithium. A narrative review concerning the case was also performed. Results Kleist’s ‘innate instability’ permeates much of the previous literature. Similar entities highlight different issues closely related to various biological rhythms: atypical psychosis and epilepsy, puerperal psychosis and estrogen dysregulation, cyclic psychosis and sleep disorders, delirious mania and effectiveness of electro-convulsive-therapy, etc. Conclusions Our findings point to the clinical relevance of oneiroid cyclic psychosis as innate instability. Further studies on the role of biological rhythms and its repercussions on daily practice are required. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Current consensus diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine (VM) describes this as an episodic disorder. However, a minority of patients report prolonged (>72 h duration) or even persistent VM symptoms, prompting whether a chronic variant of vestibular migraine (CVM) should be introduced to the current classification and how best to define it. Here we summarize current evidence of such a potential chronic variant of VM and critically review proposed definitions for CVM. Potential approaches to establish a diagnostic framework for CVM include (a) following the distinction between episodic and chronic migraine headaches, namely, frequent and/or prolonged episodes of VM (but not persistent vertigo or dizziness) in the context of chronic migraine headaches or (b) daily dizzy spells over more than 6 months that responded well to prophylactic anti-migraine therapy. A key challenge when defining diagnostic criteria for CVM is how to distinguish it from other chronic vestibular syndromes such as motion sickness, persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD), and mal de débarquement syndrome. Indeed, more than 50% of patients with PPPD and up to 46% with mal de débarquement syndrome fulfil diagnostic criteria for episodic migraine headaches, suggesting these disorders may all lie along a spectrum. We propose that when VM becomes persistent, it is best classified as PPPD but that VM and PPPD are not mutually exclusive, such that patients with PPPD need not have features of VM, and the triggering event for persistent dizziness may be independent of migraine. However, further research is needed to better characterize the spectrum of clinical phenotypes in patients with chronic dizziness, migraine headaches and anxiety, to define whether a chronic variant of VM sufficiently differs from current persistent dizziness definitions.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as unpleasant or undesirable behavioral or experiential phenomena that occur predominately or exclusively during the sleep period. Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

Some DSM definitions are viewed as either invalid (narcissistic personality disorder) or related to other conditions (schizotypal personality). Instead, DSM-based personality “disorders” are seen as psychoanalytic speculations, with weak empirical support, except for borderline personality and antisocial personality. Other aspects of personality are best understood as traits, rather than “disorders,” or as symptomatic changes that are acute and occur lower in the hierarchy of diagnosis than mood or psychotic states, and are caused by the latter. The common report of purported comorbidity is seen as an overestimation, with personality changes often being part of other conditions. Symptomatic treatment is seen to be questionable in benefit over risk, both for dopamine blockers and for SRIs.",

      "abstract": "The various causes of tremor are considered by order of prevalence in the elderly. 1) Essential tremor occurs in 5% of the population beyond 65 years of age. It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

      "title": "Diagnostic guidelines for bipolar depression: a probabilistic approach",
      "abstract": "Objectives: There are currently no accepted diagnostic criteria for bipolar depression for either research or clinical purposes. This paper aimed to develop recommendations for diagnostic criteria for bipolar I depression. Methods: Studies on the clinical characteristics of bipolar and unipolar depression were reviewed. To identify relevant papers, literature searches using PubMed and Medline were undertaken. Results: There are no pathognomonic characteristics of bipolar I depression compared to unipolar depressive disorder. There are, however, replicated findings of clinical characteristics that are more common in both bipolar I depression and unipolar depressive disorder, respectively, or which are observed in unipolar‐depressed patients who ‘convert’ (i.e., who later develop hypo/manic symptoms) to bipolar disorder over time. The following features are more common in bipolar I depression (or in unipolar ‘converters’ to bipolar disorder): ‘atypical’ depressive features such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis; psychomotor retardation; psychotic features, and/or pathological guilt; and lability of mood. Furthermore, bipolar‐depressed patients are more likely to have an earlier age of onset of their first depressive episode, to have more prior episodes of depression, to have shorter depressive episodes, and to have a family history of bipolar disorder. The following features are more common in unipolar depressive disorder: initial insomnia/reduced sleep; appetite, and/or weight loss; normal or increased activity levels; somatic complaints; later age of onset of first depressive episode; prolonged episodes; and no family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Rather than proposing a categorical diagnostic distinction between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, we would recommend a ‘probabilistic’ (or likelihood) approach. While there is no ‘point of rarity’ between the two presentations, there is, rather, a differential likelihood of experiencing the above symptoms and signs of depression. A table outlining draft proposed operationalized criteria for such an approach is provided. The specific details of such a probabilistic approach need to be further explored. For example, to be useful, any diagnostic innovation should inform treatment choices.",

      "title": "New Daily Persistent Headache",
      "abstract": "One day, on a particular remembered day, out of the blue, a headache starts. Then, the headache stays, and nothing seems to make it go away. After going to the doctor, maybe many doctors, no cause is found. This is how New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH) begins. Sometimes there has been a cold or brief viral illness before the headache starts, and sometimes there is a seemingly unrelated stressful life event, but often there is no logical reason for the headache to begin so suddenly, or for it to stay. Frequently, the person can remember the exact day the NDPH started. Often, there is no previous history of headaches. About 50% of those with NDPH have migraine features such as light and noise sensitivity, or nausea. Or, the headache may be more similar to a tension-type headache, mild, two-sided, and not pounding. There is no difference in the likelihood of improvement between those with NDPH with migraine features compared to those with tension-type NDPH. The diagnosis of NDPH requires that the headache persist for 3 months without stopping, and it must not be caused by another medical problem. NDPH can occur at any age from childhood on, even into the 70s. The average age of onset is about 35. It is two to three times more common in women than men. Almost half of those with NDPH have a close relative with frequent headaches. Up to 30% of individuals have had a cold or flu-like illness before the start of the headache, about 10% recall a stressful life event beforehand, and about the same number had some surgery involving the head (but not brain surgery). That leaves at least 50% of individuals recalling no triggering event. Many headaches that are not NDPH have a similar abrupt onset, and sometimes sudden headaches can be dangerous. An onset of headache like a thunderclap in a storm can signal bleeding in the brain, a leak in cerebrospinal fluid, an infection, cancer, or unidentified trauma causing damage to the brain tissue. Uncommonly, untreated sinusitis or even severe high blood pressure can cause a continuous headache. However, if a headache continues for 3 months, with a completely normal examination, the likelihood of abnormal testing is low. Blood testing should be performed with the new onset of continuous headache looking for anemia or an increase or decrease in white blood cells or platelets, the blood cells that help blood to clot. Further blood testing should make sure that the body's chemistry is normal, and that the kidneys and liver are functioning as they should. Imaging of the head, such as a CAT scan (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI of the arteries (MRA), and MRI of the veins (MRV) are ordered to make sure nothing is missed. A measure of spinal fluid pressure may be performed by placing a small needle in the back, a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap. The neck may be examined to make sure there is no compression of the nerves resulting in an ongoing headache. The blood vessels that supply the brain may also be checked to make sure there is no interruption in flow. In individuals older than 50, a blood erythrocyte rate (ESR) is drawn, and there may be a biopsy of the arteries at the temples if the ESR is elevated. The tests chosen depend on the person, the history of the headaches, as well as the examination. When evaluating NDPH, it is important to make sure that the daily headache is not the result of medication overuse, which can also result in daily headache. If a person is using pain medications of any kind, including over the counter pills, more than 2 days per week, the diagnosis of NDPH cannot be made until this overuse of medication stops. Still, it is hard to figure out how medication overuse would start daily, continuous headache on a particular day. Although we recommend keeping as-needed medication use to less than 3 days per week, it is not clear that this intervention helps with NDPH. People with NDPH want to know what will work to treat it, and when it will stop. Unfortunately, there is no definite answer to either question. There are two types of NDPH, the kind that goes away, and another sort that remains ongoing with or without treatment for a longer period of time, without a predictable end point. Outcome predictions vary. Some evaluations suggest that most people with NDPH will be headache free in 3 years. However, one series of 79 patients with NDPH reported that around 75% of them continued to have daily headache at 5 years, and in some the headaches do persist indefinitely. NDPH does not have known treatment or medicine that cures it. In the previous description of 79 NDPH patients, 10 patients had their headaches go away while taking a preventive medication. Six of these lucky patients had their NDPH go away while on nortriptyline, and 4 of the 10 were taking topiramate. Perhaps the reasonable course is a combination of living a healthy lifestyle with exercise, good diet, and regular sleep, coupled with preventive medicines typically used for other headache disorders, including blood pressure medications such as propranolol or candesartan, antidepressants that target pain receptors such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or venlafaxine, or antiseizure medications such as topiramate, or use of OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). Biofeedback, behavioral treatment, and relaxation therapy may also be of benefit. The most challenging problems with NDPH come from getting to the diagnosis, and even with the diagnosis, the absence of a good proven treatment. The best results are likely to come from a blended approach. Most people who have NDPH are able to lead a normal life, with eventual improvement or effective management of their daily headache.

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

The course of the illness, its aetiology and treatment approaches are discussed.

      "abstract": "Overview.Clinical types of MS.MS is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disorder of the CNS.2][3][4][5] The symptoms of MS vary, depending in part on the location of plaques within the CNS.Common symptoms include sensory disturbances in the limbs, optic nerve dysfunction, pyramidal tract dysfunction, bladder or bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, ataxia, and diplopia. 5our different clinical courses of MS have been defined. 6The first, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), is characterized by self-limited attacks of neurologic dysfunction.These attacks develop acutely, evolving over days to weeks.Over the next several weeks to months, most patients experience a recovery of function that is often (but not always) complete.Between attacks the patient is neurologically and symptomatically stable.The second clinical course, secondary progressive MS (SPMS), begins as RRMS, but at some point the attack rate is reduced and the course becomes characterized by a steady deterioration in function unrelated to acute attacks.The third clinical type, primary progressive MS (PPMS), is characterized by a steady decline in function from the beginning without acute attacks.The fourth type, progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS), also begins with a progressive course although these patients also experience occasional attacks.Outcome measures in MS clinical trials.Evaluation of the relative effectiveness of different therapies requires consideration of which outcome measure or measures are relevant to the goals of therapy.Clearly, the most important therapeutic aim of any disease-modifying treatment of MS is to prevent or postpone long-term disability.2][3] Clinical trials, by contrast, study patients for only short periods of time (2 or 3 years) and, therefore, use only short-term outcome measures to assess efficacy.As a result, it is important to validate any short-term measure by its correlation with the actual patient outcome many years later.For a discussion of these issues, interested readers should consult the full-length assessment on the Neurology Web site at www.neurology.org.Scope of this guideline.The purpose of this assessment is to consider the clinical utility of these disease-modifying agents including the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and immunosuppressive treatments that are currently available.Symptomatic and reparative therapies will not be considered.Before considering the evidence from individual",

If the fatigue lasts for more than 6 months, it fulfills the definition of \"chronic.\" The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has established specific criteria for the diagnosis of CFS. This is characterized by a persistent or relapsing debilitating fatigue for at least 6 months in the absence of a medical diagnosis that would otherwise explain the clinical presentation. CFS represents a heterogeneous group of patients that manifest symptom complexes with varying degrees of fatigue, limited exertional reserve and cognitive dysfunction. This treatise explores the pathogenesis of CFS as it relates to a complex multidimensional systemic process and offers a hypothesis for the disease processes. In particular, an up-regulated immune system, affecting mitochondrial dysfunction is described. These pathophysiologic mechanisms impact and in turn are being impacted by the neuroendocrine system and the HPA axis.

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

      "title": "Putting the pieces together: The subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder",
      "abstract": "Throughout the history of psychology there is evidence of fragmentation, at multiple levels. As a result of this fragmentation knowledge of mental illness exists in the form of separate fragments or pieces, and the understanding of the subjective experience of a mental illness as a whole is often lost in the pieces. Such fragmentation is a concern as it has a significant impact on those suffering from a mental illness, as they may not feel understood, or aspects of their experience of mental illness may be missed or overlooked. Thus potentially reducing the individual's ability and willingness to approach and engage in treatment, reducing the possible efficacy of treatment and increasing the risk of relapse. The experience of not feeling understood, difficulties engaging in treatment and relapse are particularly common for individuals with anorexia nervosa, a disorder which has markedly been prey to the fragmentation in psychology. These experiences are concerning when one considers that anorexia nervosa is a chronic disorder, associated with severe physical and psychological consequences, including death, due to physical complications or suicide. The impact of the disorder stems beyond the individual, with families and care-givers also experiencing high levels of distress. Due to the risk, severity and chronic nature of anorexia nervosa, it is important that understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa is increased to foster research, development and implementation of efficacious interventions. These concerns led to the research question guiding this research: what is the human subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder? The purpose of a broad research question was to maximize the pieces of experience gathered, as well as establish the context of experiences, and thereby gathering a picture of the subjective experience of the disorder in its complexity.;As a vast array of, albeit fragmented, knowledge exists on anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, theories and hypotheses from the literature were used as points of triangulation. In order to capture the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa qualitative methodology was used, and 15 self defined recovered sufferers of anorexia nervosa were interviewed. During the interview, participants were asked to describe their experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, as well as comment on the perceived relevance of theory and hypotheses (or pieces of knowledge) from four different orientations (biological, social-cognitive, family and existential) that exist in the field. Data analysis involved gathering pieces from theory and participant experience, organizing these pieces, and working up from the data to establish a picture of an individual's experience at the different stages of the disorder, and how this changes over time. As the research was exploring both what is the subjective experience, and how it changes over time, data analysis was guided by both phenomenological and grounded theory methodology. An adapted form of Heidegger's (1962) worlds of being was also used, to assist organization of pieces, based on where the experience was in relation to the individual. From this analysis a Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, as well as phases of maintenance and recovery, were developed that meaningfully tie together pieces of experience, to capture the complex subjective experience of anorexia nervosa at different stages, and how an individual moves through the stages. The Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases increase the understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa, and have the capacity to assist research, development and implementation of efficacious treatment.;The development of the Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases, also acts as a small step towards resolving the issue of fragmentation, and recapturing the subjective experience of mental illness.",

It is recognized as feelings of being worn-out, tired, lethargic, and irritable, with fuzzy thinking and difficulty in getting going. When it occurs, it tends to last for an average of 4.4 hr. This syndrome is particularly marked following sleep of 10 or more hr when the individual is not making up a sleep deficit. Under these conditions, the worn-out syndrome is more typical than feeling just great.

In recent studies prevalence is at least 17% in primary care.

Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is characterized by unilateral or bilateral involuntary movements. Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "title": "Psychotic symptoms in young people warrant urgent referral.",
      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

At any given moment, almost 2 million people are under some formal treatment for emotional disorders, and psychiatrists now outnumber pediatricians and obstetricians.

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

Objectives To describe and discuss two clinical cases of DI, in order to show two different ways of presenting in this entity. Methods Two case report and non-systematic review. Results We present the case of a 76-year-old woman, without psychiatric history, with an DI with 5 years of evolution, referred to a psychiatric consultation by a dermatologist. The second case, is a 41-year-old woman with a history of multiple substance use disorder, with an DI with a month of evolution, who resorted to the emergency department. DI is not a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, as represented in the first case,is a primary form, which develops without any known cause or underlying disease, corresponding to a persistent delusional disorder. However, about 60% of patients have secondary forms of DI, in the context of substance misuse, some medications or in the course of physical or psychiatric diseases (e.g. stroke, delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia). Conclusions DI can occur as a primary delusional disorder or secondary to several other medical conditions. An in-depth clinical history is essential in order to make the correct diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach is also important, to exclude any possible organic etiology, not forgetting that many patients may turn to other medical specialities first.

Paediatric CFS/ME is defined in the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidelines as \"generalised fatigue persisting after routine tests and investigations have failed to identify an obvious underlying cause\".8 The NICE recommended that the fatigue should have lasted 3 months before a diagnosis is made and highlighted the fact that the fatigue must be disabling and was likely to occur in the presence of one other symptom7 (box 1). There is a philosophical discussion to be had on how diagnoses are made, particularly with diagnoses where no underlying pathogen has been identified, but it can be argued that \"delineation of a syndrome is the first step towards elucidation of the chain of causation and redefinition of the whole group or subgroups within it\".9 Box 1 ### Definitions for chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in children and young people Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health definition of chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2007 guidelines7",

Sikich and Lerman [3] defined emergence delirium as “a disturbance in a child’s awareness of and attention to his/her environment with disorientation and perceptual alterations, including hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive motor behavior in the immediate postanesthesia period.” Emergence agitation and emergence delirium have been used interchangeably in most of the literature. Despite numerous attempts to explain the causes of emergence agitation/delirium, there is no definitive explanation. Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it.

For first-episode or first-admission patients, the follow-up itself often clarifies the diagnosis. Thus, to minimize misclassification, it would be critical to include in the sample patients who either present with, or have for the potential for developing, schizophrenia, e.g., true-positive and false-negative cases.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder where the body attacks its own insulating myelin sheaths covering the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. MS patients show signs of mental illness via emotional blunting, liability, apathy, depression, irritability, and psychosis. Many psychiatrists have noted that the symptomatology of mood disorder is very similar to early signs of MS. The mechanism behind the relationship of depression with MS is not entirely understood at this point. However, through advancements in medical imaging techniques, there are now some leading explanations. One main explanation suggests that depression and memory disturbance are correlated to the demyelination within the limbic system caused by MS. Studies showed that following a diagnosis of MS, the rates of depression are significantly elevated in patients. Several studies noted a lifetime prevalence of major depression in >50% of MS patients. These studies foreshadow that depression is a very important clinical harbinger of active demyelination in MS patients. Depression may hint at which subgroup or stage the MS patient is in, without needing to wait for dramatic physical signs or symptoms to commence. Future physicians may be able to use depression as a prodrome for multiple sclerosis and narrow down the prognosis of their patients, treating them earlier.",

      "title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHONEUROSES— A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

      "title": "Understanding Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Management Options",
      "abstract": "Obsessive compulsive disorder is a common mental health problem. It is characterized by obsession and compulsion. Obsession can be defined as unwanted, intrusive, recurrent and persistent thoughts, images or impulses which are not voluntarily produced, but are experienced as events that invade a person's consciousness. Compulsion can be defined as repetitive and seemingly purposeful behavior that is performed according to certain rules or in a stereotyped fashion and is not an end in itself but is usually intended to prevent some event or situation. The obsessions or compulsions interfere significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational functioning, usual social activities, or relationships. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and several related disorders are now put together into separate chapter in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). Literature search was performed with the key words \"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\", \"Obsession\", \"Compulsion\", \"Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\". Representative and leading researches from last 25 years were included in the study. Modern concepts of OCD began to evolve in the nineteenth century. Obsessions, in which insight was preserved, were gradually distinguished from delusions, in which it was not. The core features of OCD are remarkably similar from one country to the next, but its manifestations may differ for reasons of culture and experience. OCD is typically a chronic disorder with a waxing and waning course. In classical psychoanalytic theory, OCD was considered a regression from the Oedepal phase to the anal psycho-sexual phase of development. Functional brain imaging studies have produced a model for pathophysiology of OCD which involves hyperactivity in certain subcortical and cortical regions. The idea that abnormality in serotonergic neurotransmission underlies OCD arose from the observation that clomipramine, which inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, relieved symptoms, whereas noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors did not. During the last 40 years there has been considerable progress in the pharmacological management of OCD. Behavioral therapy is also considered as an effective way of controlling OCD. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a well-documented intervention for children, adolescents, and adults with OCD. Other biological approaches for obsessive-compulsive disorder include neurosurgery, deepbrain stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The neurosurgical techniques of cingulotomy and capsulotomy may provide clinical improvement among some patients with treatmentrefractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Overall, stereotactic surgery should be viewed as a last option in treating refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Faridpur Med. Coll. J. Jan 2020;15(1): 38-42",

      "title": "Mental Retardation: Biologic Aspects of Concern to Pediatricians",
      "abstract": "1. Approximately 3% of the population (6 to 7 million persons in the United States) is mentally retarded. Of these, severe mental retardation (IQ &amp;lt;50) occurs in about 10% (3 or 4 per 1,000 persons) and mild mental retardation (IQ 50 to 70) in 90%. 2. The high familial occurrence, the continuously variable phenotype shading into normality, and various genetic studies suggest that most of mild mental retardation represents the left end of the normal IQ distribution curve. Virtually no such cases can be found in the group of the severely retarded, either within or outside the institutions, suggesting that the majority of severe mental retardation represents discontinuous phenotypes due to chromosomal, environmental, mendelian, and multifactorial causes. 3. Some mild mental retardation represents syndromal occurrence (ie, mild PKU, rubella syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome); however, in most cases no anomalies are found, chromosomes are normal, height and head circumference fall within normal limits, and few have neurologic deficits, such as cerebral palsy and/or seizures. In the mildly retarded, personal, emotional and psychosocial problems predominate. The severely retarded are a biologically different group with a high incidence of gross neurologic disturbances, growth failure, abnormal head circumference, single or multiple malformations, and metabolic diseases. 4. The severely retarded are generally infertile, the mild retarded less fertile than average; however, a small minority among the latter contributes a disproportionately large number of retarded offspring to the next generation. 5. Most mental retardation can be evaluated on an outpatient basis for causal, pathogenetic, and prognostic factors. The evaluation can be economic, quick, reliable, painless, and efficient in most instances; however, CNS degenerative diseases may require a brief inpatient stay for biochemical evaluation. By all odds the most informative items in the work-up of the retarded are the (family and past) history and the (physical and neurologic) examination. Metabolic screening is usually not indicated in the malformed, neither are cytogenetic studies in the nonmalformed. 6. All patients with mental retardation deserve a diagnostic/causal evaluation and their families prognostic/genetic counseling. 7. Some 70% of mental retardation in the general population can be attributed to genetic causes. Genetic counseling in severe mental retardation is to prevent recurrence in siblings; in the mildly retarded much greater emphasis is placed on the prevention of retarded offspring.",

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common (lifetime prevalence of about 2%; Buhlmann et al. 2010) and often severe disorder whose core feature is preoccupation with one or more nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning, and it is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual who meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013) (see Box 22- ). Insight regarding the perceived flaws (e.g., \"I look ugly\") is usually absent or poor; most individuals are completely or mostly convinced that their view of their perceived deformities is accurate (Phillips et al. 2012). All persons with BDD, at some point during the illness, perform compulsive behaviors aimed at checking, fixing, hiding, or obtaining reassurance about the perceived appearance defects (Phillips et al. 2005a). BDD is characterized by poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of suicidality (Buhlmann et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2005b, 2008; Veale et al. 1996a), yet BDD usually goes undiagnosed in clinical settings (Conroy et al. 2008; Grant et al. 2001). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder 300.7 F45.22 Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the appearance concerns. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \"I look ugly\" or \"I look deformed\"). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. Believing that they look ugly or abnormal, many patients seek and receive cosmetic treatment. Studies from psychiatry settings have found that about two-thirds of patients with BDD receive surgery or dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatment for their perceived flaws (Crerand et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2001a). In one study ( N = 250), only 7% of such treatments led to overall improvement in BDD (Phillips et al. 2001a), and in another study ( N = 200), only 4% of procedures improved overall BDD symptoms (Crerand et al. 2005). These outcome data are retrospective but concur with data from a small prospective study (Tignol et al. 2007). In a survey of cosmetic surgeons, 40% reported that a patient with BDD had threatened them legally or physically (Sarwer 2002). Such reports underscore the critical importance of diagnosing BDD and implementing psychiatric treatment. Before beginning treatment, it is important to lay essential groundwork, with the goal of engaging patients, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and instilling hope. Because most patients have poor or absent insight, they may doubt that they have BDD and that psychiatric treatment can help. Psychoeducation about BDD should be provided, including the fact that it is a common and treatable disorder. Patients may benefit from reading about BDD (e.g., Phillips 2009). Trying to convince or reassure patients with poor or absent insight that they look normal is usually ineffective (one cannot impose insight), and patients typically misinterpret comments about their appearance, even if positive or reassuring, in a negative way. On the other hand, it is important not to agree with patients' negative view of their appearance because this may be devastating to them. It is helpful to empathize with patients' feelings and to focus on the likelihood that psychiatric treatment will improve their distress, preoccupation, and functioning.",

Llegando a negativa para ingerir alimentos y permanencia en posición fija de sedestación, como elementos clave para la sospecha clínica y el diagnóstico oportuno. Descripción del caso: Masculino de 57 años, con historia de síntomas afectivos, quien ingreso a urgencias diagnosticado con episodio depresivo mayor de características catatónicas, el cual mejoró con el inicio de midazolam y luego titulación de Lorazepam. Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona. En el presente caso clínico resaltamos la importancia de la cianocobalamina en la evaluación de los pacientes con síntomas catatónicos.",

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

Each subsystem or dissociative agent brings forth his or her own, however rudimentary, experience and idea of self, world, and self as a part of this world. The disorders manifest in dissociative symptoms. Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

Syndromet blev beskrevet af Hippokrates for ca. 2.500 ar siden [1]. To syndromer gav han betegnelserne phrenitis og lethargus, hvilket svarer til henholdsvis hyperaktivt og hypoaktivt delirium. Betegnelsen delirium blev indfort af den romerske feltlaege Celsus i ca. ar 30. Syndromet har haft mange forskellige navne helt op til vor tid. I faglitteraturen fra de seneste 30 ar kan der findes mindst 25 forskellige betegnelser for delirium. I 1980 blev begrebet delirium genindfort i den amerikanske diagnoseliste DSM-III, hvor der for forste gang blev opstillet specifikke diagnostiske kriterier for lidelsen. I ICD-10-diagnoselisten, der blev taget i brug i 1993, er delirium ogsa indfort som diagnose. De diagnostiske kernesymptomer ved delirium er vist i Tabel 1. Associerede symptomer kan vaere de mest dominerende og umiddelbart iojnefaldende [2, 3]. Afgorende for diagnosen er ofte den akutte debut og det svingende forlob i lobet af dognet samt forekomst af akut somatisk sygdom eller postoperativ tilstand hos en praedisponeret patient (hoj alder, kognitiv svaekkelse m.v.). Delirium inddeles i hypoaktivt, hyperaktivt og blandet delirium med fluktuerende hypoog hyperaktivitet [4, 5]. Karakteristiske forskelle mellem hypoog hyperaktivt delirium fremgar af Tabel 1. Hallucinationer og vrangforestillinger forekommer hyppigst ved hyperaktivt delirium (ca. 75%), men disse symptomer er ogsa hyppige ved hypoaktivt delirium (40-50%) [4]. En subtype vil i de fleste tilfaelde forblive samme subtype under hele forlobet [5]. Det er uafklaret, om subtyperne har forskellig aetiologi, patofysiologi og prognose [2-5]. Delirium bliver ofte underdiagnosticeret i akutmodtagelser, og dette gaelder isaer hypoaktivt delirium [3, 6, 7]. I Tabel 2 er angivet differentialdiagnoser ved delirium.",

Cluster A reflects odd or eccentric character structure; Cluster B reflects dramatic, emotional, or erratic character structure; and Cluster C reflects anxious or fearful character structure. Further details on diagnosis, etiology, and treatment issues follow. Accurate identification and optimal treatment of PDs can help improve outcomes of other psychiatric and medical illness.",

Apathy is a syndrome that is distinct from depression. The cardinal symptoms of depression are pervasive feelings of sadness or anhedonia, accompanied by sleep and appetite changes, feelings of hopelessness, and guilt and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, patients with apathy (with or without depression) exhibit greater deficits on measures of executive function than patients rated as dysphoric, providing additional evidence that the two disorders are distinct.",

      "abstract": "Depressive disorders are the most frequent psychiatric comorbidity in epilepsy, occurring in one out of every three to four patients in the course of their life. Unfortunately, depressive disorders remain underrecognized and undertreated. The presence of a depressive disorder can impact the life of patients with epilepsy (PWE) at several levels because they can significantly worsen quality of life, increase suicidal risk, and worsen the response of seizure disorders to pharmacological and surgical treatment. Depressive disorders in PWE may mimic primary depressive disorders; however, in a significant percentage of patients they present with atypical clinical manifestations as a pleomorphic disorder associated with frequent symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and pain. Depressive disorders have a bidirectional relationship with epilepsy, which is explained by the existence of common pathogenic mechanisms operant in both conditions. This bidirectional relationship explains the relatively high comorbidity of depressive disorders in PWE and may provide answers regarding the worse prognosis of the seizure disorder in depressed patients. The use of screening self-rating scales may help to identify depressive episodes in PWE, but a diagnosis cannot be established without an additional, in-depth evaluation. Given the negative impact of depression in PWE, its timely recognition and treatment is of the essence in epilepsy patients.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mood disorders are common. For example, each year in the United States, 1.2 million people are diagnosed with major depressive disorder, an incidence of 5%–10%. Major depressive disorder affects at least 20% of women and 12% of men at some point in their lives. Mood disorders also are costly. For example, major depressive disorder not only is more prevalent than arthritis, diabetes, or heart disease; it also causes more emotional and physical impairment. Further, it affects patients’ health indirectly, by increasing the morbidity and mortality associated with coexisting medical conditions. A recent study of premature mortality and disability ranked major depressive disorder as the fourth leading cause of worldwide disease burden. Finally, mood disorders can be lethal; up to 15% of such patients die by suicide. Despite all of this (and despite the availability of effective treatments), mood disorders remain underrecognized and undertreated. Mood disorders resist reductionistic explanatory theories. Substantial evidence suggests that mood disorders are diseases. However, they are diseases that become intertwined with patients’ individual life stories and personalities. Adverse life events trigger or exacerbate mood disorders, and the illness may then become the major adverse event in a patient’s life. Furthermore, up to 85% of depressed patients experience multiple episodes of illness, such that it becomes increasing difficult to distinguish the “illness” from the “person.”",

      "abstract": "Cenesthopathy is a syndrome where patients persistently complain of abnormal sensations in some particular parts of their body, giving them odd descriptions, with the sensations being medically unexplainable. It is also often chronic and refractory to treatment It is commonly divided into two types: one is defined in a narrow sense, with only an abnormal sensation of the body as the main symptom, and the other in a wider sense, where the sensation is a syndrome accompanying schizophrenia, depression, or organic psychiatric disorder. The nosological evaluation of cenesthopathy has not been established. We report two pre-senile female patients with cenesthopathy under agitated conditions continuing for years, with a diagnosis of depression, and they were resolved with lithium carbonate administered for a manic or mixed state exhibited later. There have been few reports on cenesthopathy accompanying a manic or mixed state, or the effect of lithium carbonate on such a condition. Our cases showed that a manic factor or mixed state plays an important role in agitated symptoms often observed in pre-senile and senile depression. We propose that the hypochondriacal state involving cenesthopathy may be strongly associated with a manic factor, as has been psychopathologically discussed in foreign and domestic literature, including studies of Ey, H. and Leonhard, K. Although cenesthopathy has been mainly treated with antidepressants and antipsychotics, considering the weight of a manic factor and mixed state, mood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate at an adequate dosage may prove to be effective.",

En 1955, Bedford estudio a 120 pacientes ancianos que desarrollaron demencia en el periodo postoperatorio; aunque este problema ha sido reconocido desde el siglo XVI aparecieron los primeros reportes en 1819. Cuenta con diversos sinonimos tales como: estado desconcertante agudo, sindrome de cerebro agudo, disfuncion mental, etc. La demencia es un sindrome definido por un deterioro cognitivo global con repercusion funcional, sin afectacion de la conciencia. Se caracteriza por un inicio gradual y curso progresivo. Puede ser dificil distinguir entre demencia y delirium debido a que muchas veces coexisten. Hasta un 50% de las demencias tienen un delirium asociado al ingreso y entre 25-50% de los pacientes con delirium tienen una demencia de base. Los principales rasgos para diferenciar ambos trastornos son: Inicio y curso: en el delirium los sintomas comienzan rapida y bruscamente, desarrollandose en horas o dias, mientras que en la demencia el curso es lentamente progresivo, de meses. Estado de la conciencia: en la demencia el individuo se mantiene alerta con poca o ninguna alteracion de la conciencia al contrario del delirium. En la actualidad, el delirio postoperatorio es una entidad bien definida (Cuadro I). La incidencia en ancianos va de 10% a 60%; en estudios recientes han incluido a las poblaciones quirurgicas oftalmicas, ortopedicas, y cardiacas. Diversos autores han destacado la correlacion del delirio postoperatorio con la hipoxemia perioperatoria y recomiendan la supervision electroencefalografica durante la cirugia(1-3). Se han realizado multiples esfuerzos para encontrar nuevas pruebas para un diagnostico temprano del delirio postoperatorio.

It was first described in 1875 by Kahlbaum (1) who reported 25 patients with a \"brain disease\" characterized by four of the following signs: long periods of immobility, mutism alternating with verbigeration, staring, withdrawal and refusal to eat or drink, negativism, posturing and grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, stereotypy, and waxy flexibility (see Table 1). Kahlbaum observed that these otherwise immobile patients could become very agitated or excited and were often found to have extremes of mood disturbance in the form of \"melancholy\" or \"mania.\" This phenomenon of marked, polar alterations in the predominant psychomotor state eventually led to division of the syndrome into retarded and excited types (2). The excited form has been much more difficult to characterize and distinguish from mania (3). In rare instances, patients with severe motor excitement develop fever, autonomic disturbances, stupor, and rhabdomyolysis and may succumb to cardiovascular collapse. This clinical state has been referred to as lethal or malignant catatonia (4,5) and the clinical and laboratory similarities to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has generated considerable interest and discussion (6,7).",

With cervical dystonia, 25.3% to 83.6% of patients will have a psychiatric disorder at some point in their lives; in blepharospasm, 67.7% to 71%; and in spasmodic dysphonia, between 37% and 42%.2 Most studies reveal no correlation between the severity of dystonia and a psychiatric disorder, raising the possibility that the high prevalence of lifetime psychiatric comorbidity might be a primary rather than a secondary phenomenon in focal dystonia.1,4 In addition, results of some generalized dystonia studies suggest that major depressive disorders may not arise primarily from motor disability but rather are linked to the DYT1 dystonia mutation.5 Neuropsychiatric disorders in dystonia significantly affect quality of life, which correlates with depression and anxiety.1,2 Although the prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders in dystonia is greater than in age- and sex-matched controls, the risk and the incidence of suicidal behavior among patients with dystonia have not been investigated.",

Schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, and obsessive neurosis, are found in the pedigrees in different combinations. The study of these pedigrees would lead to the conclusion that interaction of more than one psychosis gives rise to atypical forms as a result of an attempt to establish a state of balance between opposing dynamic actions, as in reversible chemical reactions. Probands' symptoms are less severe and with an often more favourable prognosis. Epilepsy tends to become independent and the major psychoses seem to be epistatic on it. Af for obsessive-compulsive neurosis, probands may progress into schizophrenia or depression if one of these psychoses is present n the pedigree, or may represent the neurotic form of the major disease.",

      "title": "Is thyroid dysfunction a cause or a trigger of bipolar disorder? a case report",
      "abstract": "Here we report on a case of a 40-year-old female patient who presented with hypomanic episode after hyperthyroidism and major depressive episode after hypothyroidism, which was initially misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder due to another medical condition, and was found to be a co-morbid bipolar disorder of hyperthyroidism after treatment and follow-up. The course of diagnosis and treatment in this case suggests a close temporal relationship does not necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship on a physiologic level. User's Guide for the SCID-5-CV Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders elaborate that the diagnosis of \"……due to another medical condition\" is relatively rare, and co-morbidity between psychiatric disorders and somatic diseases is much more common. Therefore, the relationship between somatic diseases and psychiatric disorders requires careful study of symptom correlation and more time for observational follow-up. When in doubt, the examiner's default assumption should be that the somatic disease is not the cause (i.e., the psychiatric disorder is primary).",

Secondary mania differs from primary mania with advanced beginning age, absence of family history, more difficult and slower response to treatment; and secondary mania usually has no recurrence. In this report, secondary mania and its clinical features are discussed in light of a mood disorder following a trauma case.

Our patient was 70 years old woman, who was living with her sister came to psychiatric outpatient clinic with the symptoms of paranoid persecutory delusion and delusion of reference, diagnosed as a \"paranoid schizophrenia\" according to DSM- IV criterias.

      "abstract": "Most women of reproductive age (about 80%) experience premenstrual symptoms, which indicate the approaching menstruation and are of little clinical significance, since they do not affect the quality of life. However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

Functional impairment is common with these disorders and, along with depression, is among the leading causes of disability and work-related absences. As such, it is postulated that the economic burden of anxiety disorders is greater than any other psychiatric disorder, due to the high prevalence and cost of medical and psychiatric treatment [2]. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), defines fear as \"the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat\" and anxiety as \"anticipation of future threat.\" Fear typically induces surges of autonomic arousal and thoughts of immediate danger and escape, whereas anxiety typically manifests as muscular tension and avoidant behaviors. The anxiety disorders listed in the DSM-5 tend to be highly comorbid with other psychiatric conditions [1]. The DSM-5 chapter on Anxiety Disorders no longer includes obsessive-compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, or acute stress disorder, which had been included in this section in the DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR. Due to their relevance, these associated disorders will be discussed briefly in this chapter. Relevant changes to anxiety disorders in the DSM-5 are outlined in Table 1. Of note, the DSM-5 requires a minimum of 6-month duration of symptoms that are not attributable to another medical condition and mental disorder or induced by a substance or medication to meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders. An exception is noted in symptom duration for children with separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism, with a required duration of 4 weeks and 1 month, respectively. Panic disorder and agoraphobia have been unlinked in the DSM-5, and panic attacks can now be listed as a specifier, applicable to all DSM-5 disorders [1]. Many anxiety disorders develop in early childhood and typically persist into adulthood if not adequately treated. These disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety in magnitude of reaction and/or persistence beyond developmentally appropriate periods. A thorough grasp of a proper differential diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders can be daunting; however, it may be easier to conceptualize various anxiety disorders from the perspective of the developmental spectrum, using age of onset to help guide a differential [1, 3].",

      "title": "Lumateperone for the Treatment of Schizophrenia.",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe psychotic disorder that is diagnosed by the presence of hallucinations or delusions along with disorganized speech, disorganized thought, or negative symptoms that are present for at least six months. Roughly 1 in 10,000 people a year are diagnosed with this psychiatric disorder. It is a chronic disorder requiring a lifetime of treatment of which antipsychotics have been the mainstay of this treatment. First-generation antipsychotics have dystonia, parkinsonism, and development of Tardive Dyskinesia as major side effects, and they are also nonspecific in terms of their actions. Second Generation antipsychotics target more specific dopamine and sometimes serotonin receptors with less dystonic side effects; however, there are additional concerns for the development of metabolic syndrome. This review aims to look at new medication on the market, lumateperone, for the treatment of Schizophrenia.In one four week study with 60mg and 120mg of Lumateperone compared, 4mg of Risperdal, and a placebo found that Lumateperone significantly decreased the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline. Safety analysis of this study also found that Lumateperone was not associated with EPS or significant weight gain. Another study found that 42mg of Lumateperone significantly decreased PANSS score over placebo and 28mg of Lumateperone with associated TEAEs of somnolence, sedation, fatigue, and constipation. In an open-label safety, patients were switched from their current antipsychotic to Lumateperone and then switched back to their previous treatment after six weeks. PATIENTS were found to have statistically significant improvements in metabolic parameters, weight, and endocrine parameters, which were all lost when they were switched back to their previous treatment and their schizophrenic symptoms at pre-trial levels or improved them while on Lumateperone. In a continuation of the previous study over 12 months, 4 TEAEs occurred in 5% or more of the participants: diarrhea, dry mouth, weight decrease, and headache. Prolactin, metabolic labs, BMI, and weight all decreased as compared to the standard of care. Pooled studies revealed EPS related TEAEs were less frequent in patients receiving 42 mg lumateperone over Risperdal. Another pooled study looked at the safety profile; they found patients treated with lumateperone, two TEAEs occurred at twice the placebo rate and at a rate of 5% or more: dry mouth (5% vs. 2.2%) and sedation (24.1% vs. 10.0%) though TEAE discontinuation rates were lower than with Risperdal.Taken together, data from these trials suggest that lumateperone can effectively treat positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Lumateperone entrance to the market introduces an innovative way to treat schizophrenia featuring both a novel mechanism of action and a markedly reduced side effect profile. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of Lumateperone in treating bipolar disorder in addition to schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Although rolandic epilepsy is the only epileptic syndrome that, at present, fully meets all the criteria of benignity and is widely recognized as such, there are also other forms of partial epilepsy that are benign. These are also genetically determined and age-dependent, occurring in neurologically intact children older than 18 months of age. As a rule, the seizures are brief and infrequent, usually responding well to antiepileptic drugs and remitting spontaneously before adulthood. The EEG background is normal, the morphology of the spikes is typical, and they are activated by sleep; generalized spike-wave discharges may occur. During the past decade, there have been reports of a number of additional syndromes of benign partial epilepsy. These include benign occipital epilepsy (the most common in this group), benign frontal epilepsy, benign epilepsy with affective symptomatology (or benign psychomotor epilepsy), benign epilepsy with extreme somatosensory evoked potentials, benign partial epilepsy of adolescence, and benign epilepsy associated with multiple spike foci. The Landau-Kleffner syndrome is often included among the benign epilepsies. These nonrolandic benign epilepsies are described in detail, and the relevant literature is reviewed.",

The presence of mixed features (symptoms of both depression and mania in a single acute episode) is associated with both poorer acute treatment response and poorer longitudinal outcomes, including shorter subsequent inter-episode periods and greater suicidality. Mixed features are indicative of an overall greater severity of both acute and chronic illness (Slide 1).",

      "title": "RELAPSE: Answers to Why a Patient Is Having a New Mood Episode",
      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "title": "Drug treatments for schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

      "abstract": "Psychosis resulting from stimulant overuse is commonly observed in clinical practices today. This is in large part due to the significant increase in attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) diagnoses in recent years, the increase in methamphetamine trafficking, and the prevalence of stimulant use in the day-to-day activities by many of those living in today's fast-paced society. The current inability to predict those users who will experience stimulant-induced psychosis from those users who will not needs further investigation. In this case study, we examine why one particular stimulant user experiences stimulant-induced psychosis. We give an account of a patient with an acute psychotic episode admitted to the emergency room at a local hospital. During initial evaluation, it was discovered that he had been diagnosed with ADHD one month ago and that the onset of his symptoms was likely related to an overuse of amphetamines. The patient had no personal history or family history of any psychiatric or mood disorders. He had no history of recreational drug use prior to this incident, and had no history of seizures or head trauma. After appropriate pharmacological intervention with antipsychotics and psychological intervention, the patient showed gradual improvement over the next five days of his hospitalization. After the five days, he was allowed to be discharged. We conclude with the cautionary advice that a patient's susceptibility of experiencing stimulant-induced psychosis should be assessed before prescribing stimulants. In cases where stimulant use is not supervised by a physician, appropriate understanding of management of stimulant-induced psychosis is of utmost importance in order to provide the very best patient education and care.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

Patients with Huntington's or Parkinson's disease were less intellectually impaired than those with Alzheimer's disease at each functional stage. Criteria for dementia were present in all of the Alzheimer's patients but in only half of the Huntington's and Parkinson's disease groups. Patients with similar overall intellectual function scores had no distinct pattern of neuropsychological test performance. Depression, absent in patients with Alzheimer's disease, was present in half the patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's disease and was correlated with intellectual decline. The concept of subcortical dementia is misleading. The pattern of neuropsychological impairment is not distinct, and the neuropathological basis of dementia in these diseases may result from a combination of cortical and subcortical degeneration.",

      "title": "Memory and Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is generally accepted within the clinical and research community that cognitive dysfunctions represent a core feature of schizophrenia. Although neuropsychological studies in schizophrenia patients have repeatedly shown that multiple domains of cognition are affected, episodic memory measures consistently show the largest effect size, that is, the greatest disparity in performance between control and patient groups.1-3 Many patients exhibit episodic memory dysfunctions prior to the manifestation of clinical symptoms.4 Memory deficits are observed in young, medication-naive patients5'6 and remain stable over time.7 Disturbances in memory can also be seen in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia, who have never been exposed to treatment.8-10 In the last 2 decades, many researchers have come to the conclusion that episodic memory impairment indeed represents a core feature of schizophrenia,11,13 and since then, memory research in schizophrenia has been an expanding field of investigation. There is increased understanding of the conditions under which memory is more impaired,14 the association (or lack of association) with clinical symptoms has been repeatedly examined,11,15,16 and several recent functional neuroimaging studies17,23 have provided important information as to the neural correlates of these memory impairments. The 2 papers of this issue's In Review section examine separate but complementary aspects of memory problems in schizophrenia. Dr Jean-Marie Danion and his collaborators24 provide a scholarly review of experimental studies on memory impairments and schizophrenia. They show how theoretical models of episodic memory have significantly contributed to a better understanding of the memory processes selectively affected in schizophrenia and conclude that a better comprehension of those selective memory problems may guide future cognitive remediation efforts. In the second paper of this series,25 my colleagues and I review the literature on the effects of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms (in particular, flat affect and anhedonia) on memory bias in schizophrenia patients. Memory bias refers to the modulatory influence that state or trait psychopathology may exert on memory performance for specific categories of stimuli, often emotional in nature. We argue that the exploration of such memory biases may provide fresh insights into the relation between memory functions and the symptoms of schizophrenia. Together, these 2 papers provide a good overview of the experimental and cognitively oriented work on memory in schizophrenia sufferers. The underlying framework of both our review and that of Dr Danion and colleagues is that episodic memory is not a simple construct but, instead, encompasses multiple cognitive processes. Although our understanding of memory function and dysfunction has greatly improved over the last 40 years or so, there are still many unanswered questions. As these 2 reviews clearly suggest, future studies on memory and schizophrenia will greatly benefit from developments in the field of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. We hope that these review papers may generate new research questions that will ultimately lead to a better understanding of this complex relation between memory functions and schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "The catastrophic reaction (CR; a disruptive and uncontrolled behavior triggered by anger, irritability, and hostility) and emotionalism (a condition of uncontrolled crying or laughing) are disorders of the emotional regulation and expression, the prevalence of which is underestimated in neurology. Their occurrence is an additional factor of poor outcome for neurologic patients. Although they have been recognized and completely described in their clinical manifestations more than a century ago, many issues remain unsolved regarding their pathogenesis and the respective role of the brain damage and psychological factors. Thus, if pathological crying and laughing can be linked to one or more lesions within the corticospinal tracts, the emotional lability and CR have uncertain connections within specific functional brain systems and seem to be influenced by personality factors or depression and anxiety generated by coping with a serious neurological disease. These epistemological difficulties are also the consequence of some methodological limits of the questionnaires and scales, which diagnose these disorders and for which the cut-off values between the normal and pathological condition could be questioned. Thus, their assessment requires new psychophysical. The CR and emotionalism manifest in association with several different neurological disease (degenerative, vascular, inflammatory, epilepsy) and psychiatric conditions as psychosis, mania, and mood disorders. Across these different diseases, the findings of common patterns of lesion location, cognitive dysfunction, emotional changes, and behavioral responses to new paradigms might clarify the pathogenesis and orient the treatment.",

      "abstract": "It has been generally recognized that postencephalitic mental disturbances in children are always preceded by some physical signs. Behavior disturbances, recognized as due to the encephalitis, because of an acute onset following a typical epidemic encephalitis history, are nearly always accompanied by some neurologic findings in the form of pupillary changes, facial paresis, muscle stiffness, etc. These behavior disturbances have been shown to be typical of an organic brain disease quite unlike the usual behavior disturbances in children. It has been demonstrated<sup>1</sup>that there is little or no correlation between the severity of the mental disturbance and the physical symptoms; children with slight mental disturbance may have extreme physical findings and vice versa. Originally the behavior of a child was pronounced postencephalitic when the following three conditions were fulfilled: (1) a sudden change in personality, (2) physical evidence of postencephalitis and (3) a history of acute epidemic encephalitis.

The forms of the disorder involve intrusive thoughts or impulses that are experienced as internal, ego-alien, and reprehensible. Although several studies of obsessional patients have used electrodermal or cardiovascular measures as correlates of treatment response, only two have investigated obsessionals prior to treatment in relation to controls. Obsessive-compulsive disorder has been noted to be refractory to most traditional psychological treatments. Several physiologic abnormalities reported to be specific to major depression have been reported in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition, the growth hormone response to intravenous clonidine, which is blunted in primary depressives, is also abnormally reduced in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. For many obsessional patients, the primary symptoms may be an intrusive thought, guilt, or dysphoria, and not anxiety. Depression may be a more likely concomitant of obsessional disorder than agoraphobia or generalized anxiety.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them. These “minor” events can still progress to more significant harm.",

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

      "title": "Similarities and Differences between DSM-IV Brief Psychotic Disorder and ICD-10 Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Time is the most important factor in defining the diagnostic concepts of DSM-IV brief psychotic disorder (BPD) and ICD-10 acute and transient psychotic disorder (ATPD). Time factor is more complicated in ICD-10 ATPD than in DSM-IV BPD because he first time factor in ICD-10 ATPD concerns the development of symptoms (acute onset within 2 weeks), and the second factor, the duration of an episode, depends on the subtypes of ICD-10 ATPD. For instance, the duration of an episode in acute polymorphic psychotic disorder (APPD) with symptoms of schizophrenia must not exceed I month, while APPD without symptoms of schizophrenia may occur forup to three months. Despite the differences with respect to time factor in DSM-IV BPD and ICD-10 ATPD, it is not necessary to consider them as separate diagnostic entitie because they are identical in almost all of the essential clinical parameters. The strict criterion of episode duration in DSM-IV BPD should therefore be reconsidered. The APPD within ICD-10 ATPD subtypes, which is very similar to both cycloid psychosis and bouffe dlirante, has a significant diagnostic concordance with DSM-IV BPD, and can be distinguished more clearly from schizophrenia and bipolar schizoaffective disorder. In contrast, ASPD not only has similarities to schizophrenia but also to bipolar schizoaffective disorder. This means that ASPD could function as a bridge between one end of the psychotic continuum occupied by schizophrenia and the opposite end occupied by major affective disorder. Taking this into consideration, ICD-10 ATPD could be much more homogeneous if APPD was not combined with ASPD. On the other hand, the symptomatologic polymorphism carries the most relevant distinguishing power in differentiating the subtypes of ICD-10 ATPD, so the distinction of APPD with and without symptoms of schizophrenia is not needed.",

      "abstract": "We previously hypothesized that depressive and manic states may be consecutive presentations of the same underlying neuronal plasticity, and that moderate impairments in neuronal plasticity cause depressive states while further impairment to neuronal plasticity causes manic states. Psychopathological or biological relationships between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have also been revealed. Therefore, in addition to depressive and manic states, psychosis may also be considered a manifestation resulting from additional impairments to neuronal plasticity. In the present manuscript, we hypothesize that moderate and more severe impairments to neuronal plasticity cause depressive and manic states, respectively, and that more serious impairments to neuronal plasticity cause psychosis. Many studies have suggested that impairments in neuronal plasticity contribute to schizophrenia and other mental disorders with psychotic features, and that the impairment of neuronal plasticity in schizophrenia is more severe than that in bipolar disorder. Therefore, we hypothesize more specifically that impairments in neuronal plasticity may be more severe in the order of the cases featuring psychosis, mania, and depression. This progression notably overlaps with the arrangement of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder in the DSM-5. Psychotic symptoms are thought to appear further towards the base of the psychopathological hierarchy than are manic or depressive symptoms. If impairments to neuronal plasticity contribute to this psychopathological hierarchy, as we contest that they do, our hypothesis may serve as a bridge between clinical psychopathology, diagnosis, and biological psychiatry.",

Se considera que en mas de las tres cuartas partes de los mayores deprimidos pueden persistir sintomas residuales, dando lugar a estados postdepresivos en forma de depresiones menores, depresiones subum- brales o depresiones subsindromicas. Entre estos sintomas residuales mas frecuentes en los estados postdepresivos destacan las dificultades de concentracion, el enlenteci- miento, la astenia, los sintomas somaticos, los trastornos del sueno o la hipocondriasis. En los mayores son mas frecuentes las de- presiones subclinicas o subsindromicas, que frecuentemente aparecen tras la mejoria de un trastorno depresivo mayor. Los factores que se asocian para la aparicion de estas depresiones subsindromicas son de tipo so- ciodemografico (ausencia de contactos so- ciales), empeoramiento funcional, historia previa de trastornos afectivos, antecedentes de trastornos vasculares cerebrales o facto- res existenciales (preocupaciones sobre el futuro, baja percepcion de salud,..).

One-year prevalence of two or more depressive symptoms in the general population was 11.8%, a prevalence figure exceeding the 9.5% 1-year prevalence for all the DSM-III mood disorders combined. We have labeled this potential clinical condition as subsyndromal symptomatic depression (SSD), defining it as any two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia. SSD has a 1-year prevalence in the general population of 8.4%, two thirds of whom are women (63.4%). The most common SSD symptoms reported are insomnia (44.7%), feeling tired out all the time (42.1%), recurrent thoughts of death (31.0%), trouble concentrating (22.7%), significant weight gain (18.5%), slowed thinking (15.1%), and hypersomnia (15.1%). Increased prevalence of disability and welfare benefits was found in SSD as compared with respondents with no depressive symptoms. SSD represents a significant clinical population not covered by any DSM-III, DSM-III-R, or DSM-IV mood disorder diagnosis. Since SSD is also associated with significant increases in social dysfunction and disability, we feel there is good evidence to conclude that SSD is an unrecognized clinical condition of considerable public health importance that is deserving of further characterization and study.",

(1) Schizophrenic psychoses that arise before the age of 13 have a very poor prognosis. The disease usually continues to progress in adolescence and adulthood. It can be diagnosed with the same criteria that are used for adults. (2) Patients whose disease is of acute onset, with productive schizophrenic manifestations such as hallucinations and delusions (positive manifestations), have a better prognosis than those whose disease begins insidiously and takes an unfavorable course, with depressive states and continually worsening impairment of cognitive function. (3) The patient’s premorbid personality plays a major role. Patients who were described as socially active, intelligent, and integrated children and adolescents before they became ill have a better prognosis than those who were intellectually impaired, timid, introverted and uncommunicative before they became ill. (4) The prognosis seems to be better for patients who have no family history of schizophrenia, those whose families cooperate well, and those whose condition improves rapidly during inpatient treatment. (5) The few available studies on the course and outcome of schizophrenia beginning in childhood and early adolescence confirm that they are much worse than in adult-onset schizophrenia.

The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar is a mood disorder that consists at least one manic episode, hypomania, or mixed which is usually accompanied by a history of major depressive episodes. An extreme shift of mood, motivation, and energy suffered by patients with bipolar can lead to disability and even suicide. Therefore, it is important to know the symptoms, how to diagnose, and the treatment. A man, 39 years old, came with his family with the complaint of rampage and beating people for no reason. Over the past month, the family admitted patients cannot sleep. On physical examination found cuts on the right cheek. General status, neurological, and laboratory tests are in normal range, from psychiatric examination obtained clear consciousness, elevation of mood occasionally disforic, blunted affect, Inappropriate, with auditory, tactile, and visual hallucinations accompanied with delusions of greatness and erotomaniac. Patients diagnosed with axis I: F31.2 bipolar affective disorder, manic episode with psychotic symptoms; axis II: not found yet; axis III: vulnus laceratum in the right maxillary region; axis IV: primary support group problems; axis V: GAF20-11. Pharmacotherapy with haloperidol 3x2 mg tab, clozapine 2x25 mg tab, and supportive psychotherapy. Bipolar disorder in these patients was initiated after his wife passed.

Surveys suggest that patients with bipolar disorder are often misdiagnosed on initial presentation, most often with major depressive disorder. These patients may receive ineffective treatment, which, in some cases, actually worsens outcome, either by inducing manic or mixed states or by increasing mood cycling. Major contributors to misdiagnosis include incomplete history and lack of patient insight as well as presence of psychiatric comorbidity, such as anxiety or substance use disorders. Careful screening for current and past symptoms of mania or hypomania, as well as close clinical follow-up, can help to reduce misdiagnosis.",

Alongside with deficient disorders PMD are the main characteristics of post-traumatic disturbances of consciousness. PMD can be represented by different types of excitation, mistaken judgments (including paranoidal ones, confabulations, false orientation), false perception (psychosensory, in particular, illusory and hallucinatory phenomena) and affective disorders. Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly). Irritation of different brain structures and their disconnection as well as pathological neuroplasticity in prolonged forms--are considered the basis for PMD occurrence.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia with Somatic Delusions: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nSchizophrenia is a mental illness that affects approximately 1% of the general population. Symptoms most commonly include auditory hallucinations, several types of delusions, disorganization in speech and behavior, formal thought disorder, and negative symptoms including poverty of speech, thought or motivation. Of the delusional symptoms, somatic delusions-those that pertain to the body-are rather rare. Somatic delusions are defined as fixed false beliefs that one's bodily function or appearance is grossly abnormal. They are a poorly understood psychiatric symptom and pose a significant clinical challenge to clinicians. Studies indicate that only one third of this patient population has a positive treatment outcome with resolution of symptoms. While challenges exist in treating patients when they present with somatic delusions alone, it becomes far more difficult when somatic delusions present in patients with schizophrenia. Physical symptoms such as pain or discomfort are often incorrectly perceived or misinterpreted by psychotic patients. Often medical conditions are overshadowed by psychosis and may get undiagnosed or overlooked which could potentially result in fatal errors for patients. While little has been written about patients with true delusions that are somatic in nature, somatic delusions, specifically somatic delusions associated with schizophrenia are particularly under reported in the literature. Here, we describe the case of a 40-year-old Hispanic-American patient with established chronic schizophrenia. From her initial presentation to the hospital, she exhibited and perseverated on a number of somatic delusions about her body including her bones being twisted around one another, delusions of pregnancy and abortion, and her normally-functioning arm being broken. This paper will also explore treatment challenges posed by these complicated patients. In addition, a review of potential cultural influences as well as the economic burden that such patients place on the health care sector by their numerous emergency room and office visits will be discussed.",

      "title": "Dimensionality and the category of major depressive episode",
      "abstract": "Major depressive episode (MDE) is a chronic disease typified by episodes that remit and recur. It is a major contributor to the burden of disease. The diagnosis of a disorder is an expert opinion that the disorder is present. The nine symptoms of MDE exist on dimensions of greater or lesser intensity, persistence over time, change in usual state, distress and impairment. It is the clinician's task to judge whether the elicited symptoms warrant the diagnosis. The surprise is that trained clinicians can do this reliably and that diagnostic interviews and questionnaires can emulate this process. The distribution of symptoms in community surveys is exponential, with no obvious discontinuity at the diagnostic threshold. Taxometric and primary care studies confirm this. The number of symptoms predicts severity, comorbidity, family history, disability, help seeking and treatment recommendations. The latent structure of mental disorders places MDE in the distress misery cluster. Measures of well-being, distress, disability and neuroticism correlate with the number of symptoms but the relation is not perfect. The Patient Health Questionnaire is derived from the diagnostic criteria and does not suffer this limitation. The introduction of measures like this would acknowledge dimensionality, would facilitate recognition, guide treatment, and be acceptable to consumers, providers and funders.

Any one of the syndromes listed in Table 4–1 can occur in either an isolated form, affecting only a single area or single cell type in the nervous system, or as part of a more widespread disorder called by Henson and colleagues encephalomyelitis with carcinoma.1 However, even when the clinical findings are restricted to dysfunction of the brain, autopsy studies usually reveal more widespread abnormalities, particularly inflammation.1 The classification given in Table 4–1 is by no means clinically discrete. For example, sleep disorders may occur with either hypothalamic or brainstem dysfunction, or both. Parkinsonian-like syndromes may arise from the basal ganglia or the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Nevertheless, this classification allows a structure for thinking about paraneoplastic neurologic symptoms. With the exception of limbic encephalitis, these disorders are quite rare.",

There seems to be no prognostic value to the pathological, physiological or psychological factors with which the first convulsion is associated. 3. Those cases where the convulsions occur without any apparent exciting factor (that is without trauma, teething, gastro-intestinal upsets, etc.) are invariably more significant and the prognosis should be more guarded than those cases where the convulsion is associated with some definite etiology. 4. In a fairly large group of cases, the convulsion is but a symptom of an unstable nervous system, one that is unable to withstand the ordinary vicissitudes to which the normal child is subjected. 5. There is undoubtedly a fairly large group of convulsive disorders in childhood where the convulsions are symptoms of an undiagnosed meningitis or encephalitis, which leaves behind irreparable damage to the nervous system. 6. The convulsion itself, though not associated with any devastating disease, such as meningitis, or encephalitis, may produce damage from which the brain never recovers, as seen in: (a) Some of the spastic conditions which follow immediately upon a series of convulsions. (b) Those cases following convulsions without neurological signs, but which have to adjust on a very much lower mental level. 7. The convulsions associated with rickets and tetany may leave behind very definite damage to the nervous system. 8. There is reason to believe that if the infantile convulsions associated with rickets, gastro-intestinal upsets, and acute infections were looked upon more seriously, and a greater effort made to prevent their occurrence during early life, much epilepsy and mental deficiency might be prevented.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "title": "Organic mood disorder: Sequelae of small vessel disease",
      "abstract": "Sir, Bipolar disorder predominantly begins in young adults, with evidence of bimodal presentation with a second peak in late life, i.e., beyond 50 years, wherein diagnosis is difficult.[1] Cerebrovascular lesions, ischemic variety, may be one of the etiological causes for such neuropsychiatric complication, and small vessel involvement may not present with typical stroke syndrome. 2 We present here a mood disorder, manic type secondary to small vessel disease. A 64-year-old female was brought with complaints of memory disturbances and irritable behavior for 1 year. Onset was noted with giddiness and one episode with fall associated with loss of consciousness. She was managed conservatively for this. During the last 1 month, she developed agitation in the form of singing and dancing, at times noticed to be muttering to self with inadequate sleep. She would claim that she is as good as “Lata Mangeshkar” in singing. Hence, she was referred to our unit. Other symptoms were overtalkativeness, jocularity, and irritable mood. She would make inappropriate comments (about her increased sexual urges) in front of relatives and accuse the husband of infidelity. Comorbidities were diabetes mellitus and hypertension. No history of psychiatric illness in the patient (prior to this episode) or her first-degree family relatives was elicited. No history of convulsions/seizures was elicited. On mental status examination, she had increased psychomotor activity, appeared overfamiliar, and overdressed. She was distractible with pressure of speech. She had delusion of infidelity and delusion of grandiosity claiming to have superpowers and having the most melodious voice in all over India. She also claimed God, and various actors were speaking to her directly, inferred as auditory hallucinations. Her mood was elated and irritable, but her affect was stable. Her judgment was impaired. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. Neurological evaluation was normal. Clinical testing for the frontal lobe showed impaired alternate hand sequence and a lack of concern, suggesting dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal area dysfunction. She performed well on clinical parietal lobe testing. Her mini-mental status score was 16 out of 30. Since the patient was inattentive, these findings are to be interpreted with caution. Neuropsychological evaluation and neurological intervention could not be done due to the patient's uncooperativeness. Computerized tomography of the brain showed scattered ischemic foci in the bilateral frontal periventricular and left posterior parietal subcortical white matter and bilateral posterior capsule-ganglionic white matter. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain also showed multiple small ischemic foci scattered in the bilateral subcortical and periventricular deep white matter in the frontoparietal regions and associated mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. She was started on tablet sodium valproate 200 mg BD in view of irritability and impulsivity. Tablet aripiprazole 2.5 mg per day was added in view of mood-congruent psychotic symptoms, behavioral problems, and safer cardiac profile.[3] On increasing to 5 mg over a week, improvement of almost 50% was reported with decreased irritability although the delusion of infidelity and delusion of grandiosity persisted but with lesser intensity. The patient tolerated valproate well, and levels were not estimated. Cerebral small vascular disease, of the gray and white matter, is a group of pathological process with myriad etiology.[4] Classical strokes such as hemiplegia may not be seen in lacunar and white matter lesions.[56] Although responsible for ischemic strokes in 25% of cases, the manifestations vary, such as the disorders of sensation, movement, sight, speech, balance, and coordination depending on the location of the lesion.[78] We diagnosed her as an organic mood disorder secondary to the small vessel disease. This was considered due to the temporal relationship of the disinhibition, talkativeness, grandiosity with long-standing history of hypertension, history of falls as probable presentation of the lacunar infarcts, absence of past or family history of mood disorder, consistent features of behavioral change due injury to the frontal lobe and impaired functioning on clinical testing, and radiological findings justifying the deficits. Late-onset mood disorder in the elderly is less reported and devoid of guidelines for its management.[9] A small vessel disease with such a presentation may be missed, as it may be devoid of a classical stroke-like presentation with neurological deficits. Further volume of data is necessary for understanding the relationship between such vascular lesions, consequential loss of function, and the ensuing presentations of mood episodes in the elderly.

      "title": "The Neurobiology of Infantile Autism",
      "abstract": "Early infantile autism is the most severe of a group of neurodevelopmental syndromes called the pervasive developmental disorders. The clinical features of autism vary greatly, but, by definition, include deficits in social relatedness, communication, and interests or routines. The onset of autistic signs and behaviors typ ically occurs in infancy, and the syndrome is usually fully present by the fourth year. The presence of mental retardation affects the clinical picture greatly. Severely autistic children may be retarded and mute and are often preoccupied with repetitive activities; they often exhibit motor stereotypes, such as rocking or hand flapping. They can be profoundly withdrawn and may show extreme aversion to social or physical contact. More mildly affected children may have normal or even superior intelligence, with well-developed language skills. Their deficits in social relatedness and preoccupation with rituals and routines may set them apart as very odd, but not necessarily as autistic. Autism occurs in 1 of 2000 live births; boys outnumber girls about 3 or 4:1. Although there are no localizing neurological signs in autism, mild or \"soft\" neurological signs are common and grand mal seizures are frequently present after puberty (Lotspeich LJ, Ciaranello RD.

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "abstract": "Acute symptomatic seizures are those caused or provoked by an\r\nacute medical or neurological insult and it is as common as epilepsy in the\r\nmedical wards. Acute symptomatic seizures differ from epilepsy in several\r\nimportant aspects. First, unlike epilepsy, these seizures have a clearly\r\nidentifiable proximate cause, to the extent that one can never be certain of\r\na causal association. When one considers the temporal sequence of acute\r\nsymptomatic seizures (e.g.uremia, head injury, or stroke immediately\r\npreceding a seizure), the biologic plausibility (acute disruption of brain\r\nintegrity or metabolic homeostasis) and in many cases the dose effect\r\n(severity of injury correlated with the risk for seizures) all quite\r\ncompellingly indicate causation. Although a risk ratio for the immediate\r\nassociation between cause and effect has not been calculated, it must be\r\nenormous. Second, unlike epilepsy, acute symptomatic seizures are not\r\ncharacterized by a tendency to recur. The risk for subsequent epilepsy may\r\nbe increased in individuals experiencing such insults; in general, one does\r\nnot expect seizures to recur unless the underlying condition recurs. \r\nThe maximum incidence of seizures occurred in the age group of 60\r\nto 70 years in the study.\r\nCerebrovascular disease was the most common etiology observed in\r\nour study. Among cerebrovascular disease, ischemic cerebral\r\ninfarction was the most common cause. Central nervous system\r\ninfections, was the second most common cause followed by\r\nmetabolic causes in our study. So all efforts should be taken to\r\nevaluate the patients who presented with seizures in the elderly\r\npatients to identify the etiology, for accurate management.\r\nPartial seizures was the most common seizure type encountered in\r\nthe study.\r\nImmediate non contrast CT brain was useful, for emergency\r\npatients, presenting with seizures to guide appropriate acute\r\nmanagement. MRI Brain was useful in detecting lesions, which were\r\nmissed in CT Brain. Both CT Brain and MRI Brain were\r\nindispensable in patients with acute symptomatic seizures in the\r\nelderly.",

      "abstract": "A 36-year-old woman was treated for a wide variety of psychiatric illnesses over a span of two decades before a diagnosis of complex partial seizures was made. Her history included poor impulse control, rage attacks, multiple suicide attempts, rapid mood swings, depression, and psychotic episodes. Bulimia, panic attacks, severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and multiple somatic complaints were also present. In retrospect, these symptoms could be attributed to complex partial seizures with cognitive and affective symptomatology, automatisms, and psychosensory symptoms, and were controlled by anticonvulsant medications. Therefore, so-called \"purely\" psychiatric disorders should not be diagnosed before a diagnosis of limbic epilepsy (however, this might be labeled, e.g., complex partial seizure, psychomotor seizure, psychical seizure, or temporal lobe epilepsy) has been considered.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is significantly higher among patients with epilepsy than the general population. Moreover, the profile of depressive disorder is often atypical in patients with epilepsy. Data from human and animal studies have tended to point towards a bidirectional link in the pathophysiological basis of both epilepsy and depressive syndrome. Depressive symptoms in epilepsy can be divided into those occurring in the peri-ictal period (pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal), and those occurring in the inter-ictal period. Peri-ictal depressive disorders are particularly associated with temporal lobe epilepsies. These include: (i) peri-ictal dysphoria, (symptoms occur in the 24 hour period preceding a seizure); (ii) ictal depression, (symptoms develop during the seizure); (iii) post-ictal depression, (symptoms occur in the 72 hours following the seizure). The inter-ictal depressive disorders are not temporally related to seizures. The best characterized of these is ‘‘inter-ictal dysphoric disorder’’. This includes labile depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anergia, pain, insomnia), labile affective symptoms (panic-like symptoms and anxiety), and supposedly ‘‘specific’’ symptoms (paroxysmal irritability and instable-euphoric moods). Standard psychiatric classification may be inadequate to describe some of the atypical profiles seen in this patient population. Depression in patients with epilepsy is therefore under-diagnosed, and yet contributes to poorer quality of life, epilepsy outcome and risk of suicide. It is recommended that an appropriate screening tool be used to detect signs of major depression, the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E). Clinicians should recognize the characteristics of peri-ictal and inter-ictal depressive syndromes. 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

This condition still has no formal diagnostic classification. To provide more information about this potentially life-threatening condition, we studied five patients with delirious mania. Methods We describe the cases of five patients with delirious mania admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit between January 2005 and January 2007, and discuss the cases in the context of a selective review of the clinical literature describing the clinical features and treatment of delirious mania. Results Two patients had two episodes of delirious mania. Delirium usually resolved faster than mania though not always the case. Delirious mania remitted within seven sessions of the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Conclusions Delirious mania is a potentially life-threatening but under-recognized neuropsychiatric syndrome. Delirious mania that is ineffectively treated may induce a new-onset manic episode or worsen an ongoing manic episode, and the patient will need prolonged hospitalization. Delirious mania also has a close relationship with catatonia. Early recognition and aggressive treatment, especially with electroconvulsive therapy, can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

The same agents would not cause decline in an uninjured tree, and the injury alone would not cause decline. 3. Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline. Various factors including those that predisposed the tree and incited decline may then contribute to further decline. 4. Trees of similar age growing in groups tend to display group behaviour including premature senescence (synchronous cohort senescence) in response to stress.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a common psychiatric disorder that is frequently referred to as one single disorder, but can and should be divided into at least four different subtypes, namely the atypical, melancholic, combined and unspecified subtypes, which have shown differential associations with cardio-vascular risk factors. A common symptom as mentioned in the DSM-5 is sleep disturbance, which varies according to the subtype, atypical being characterized by hypersomnia and melancholic by insomnia. Those parameters and others are observable by the use of polysomnography in particular. Multiple studies have analyzed sleep in MDD subjects compared to controls, but didn’t separate MDD into subtypes and only observed current MDD episode repercussions on sleep. To our knowledge, no study has yet assessed lifetime MDD effects on sleep, where sleep is measured around the time of remission of an episode. Therefore, our goal was to assess the associations for sleep characteristics measured just before, during or after the remission of a depressive disorder, either for MDD taken as a whole and for the depression subtypes separately. Using CoLaus/PsyCoLaus data from the general population of Lausanne, 1971 subjects were selected: 1123 controls and 848 lifetime MDD subjects subtyped into 126 atypical MDD, 229 melancholic MDD and 493 unspecified MDD (combined and unspecified taken together). Different sleep parameters were measured using polysomnography, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, time in REM sleep and others. Results showed that, after adjustments for age, sex, socio-economic status, psychoactive substances, anxiety disorders and psychotropic medication, none of the sleep parameters were found to be statistically different between depressive subjects and controls. Possible reasons could be that the mix of current and past MDD subjects may have normalized the results. Indeed, our results suggest that when the MDD episode is over, sleep goes back to its normal structure, meaning that current MDD results were normalized by past MDD results. Further studies still need to be done where MDD should be subdivided according to time since remission to observe if there is an evolution in the sleep structure back to normal and if so how.",

Auditory hallucinations are especially likely to swiftly be considered due to psychiatric illness. An elderly patient with chronic auditory hallucinations without other significant psychopathology nor other symptoms prompted reflection and literature review. Objectives To review differential diagnosis of auditory hallucinosis. Methods Pubmed search for terms: auditory and hallucinosis. Results Hallucinations should be evaluated according to: type, onset and evolution, association with physical and /or neurological symptoms, association with other hallucinations and/or other psychopathology, characteristics. Auditory hallucinations may present along a continuum from tinnitus, simple, verbal, musical. The Pubmed search retrieved articles pertaining to auditory hallucinations associated with: 1. Sensory deprivation; 2. Hearing loss, auditory Charles Bonnet syndrome; 3. Dementia, neurodegenerative disorders; 4. Brainstem lesions; 5. Other central nervous lesions: thalamus, temporal, other; 6. Epilepsy; 7. Tic disorders; 8. Alcohol use disorders; 9. Borderline personality disorder; 10. Others. Conclusions Patients presenting with auditory hallucinosis should be carefully evaluated to exclude non-psychiatric disorders. In some patients, such as the one who prompted the review, an identifiable cause may not yet be found. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

Post-partum depression, which has a prevalence of 10-15%, is more serious in that it may last for several months and impair a woman's ability to function in her many roles. Clinically and with respect to causal factors post-partum depression appears to resemble depression occurring at other times. Post-partum psychosis is a disabling disorder occurring once in every 1000 deliveries. Intensive treatment, usually on an inpatient basis, is required. Women with previous psychosis or a family history of psychosis are at increased risk.

      "abstract": "Background: Depressive disorders are significantly more common in the medically ill compared to the general population. Depression is associated with worsening of physical symptoms, greater healthcare utilization and poorer treatment adherence. The present paper provides a critical review on the assessment and management of depression in the medically ill. Methods: Relevant articles pertaining to depression in the medically ill were identified, reviewed and synthesized qualitatively. A systematic review was not performed due to the large breadth of this topic, making a meaningful summary of all published and unpublished studies not feasible. Notable studies were reviewed and synthesized by a diverse set of experts to provide a balanced summary. Results: Depression is frequently under-recognized in medical settings. Differential diagnoses include delirium, personality disorders and depressive disorders secondary to substances, medications or another medical condition. Depressive symptoms in the context of an adjustment disorder should be initially managed by supportive psychological approaches. Once a mild to moderate major depressive episode is identified, a stepped care approach should be implemented, starting with general psychoeducation, psychosocial interventions and ongoing monitoring. For moderate to severe symptoms, or mild symptoms that are not responding to low-intensity interventions, the use of antidepressants or higher intensity psychotherapeutic interventions should be considered. Psychotherapeutic interventions have demonstrated benefits with small to moderate effect sizes. Antidepressant medications have also demonstrated benefits with moderate effect sizes; however, special caution is needed in evaluating side effects, drug–drug interactions as well as dose adjustments due to impairment in hepatic metabolism and/or renal clearance. Novel interventions for the treatment of depression and other illness-related psychological symptoms (e.g. death anxiety, loss of dignity) are under investigation. Limitations: Non-systematic review of the literature. Conclusion: Replicated evidence has demonstrated a bidirectional interaction between depression and medical illness. Screening and stepped care using pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is merited.",

They are mainly nocturnal and often progress to convulsions. Consciousness is usually impaired from onset or during the ictus. By definition, seizures lasting for more than half an hour are status epilepticus. In one third of these children, the phase of deviation of the eyes with vomiting and impairment of consciousness is prolonged for more than 30 minutes (partial status epilepticus) and usually ends with generalised convulsions. A typical case is of a child who wakes up from sleep agitated, vomiting, eyes deviated to one side, and who may or may not be able to communicate for minutes to hours before hemiconvulsions or generalised convulsions begin. Onset is between 1–12 years, peak is at 5 years, and remission occurs within 1–2 years from onset. In one third of the patients, seizures or even partial status epilepticus are single events in the child’s life.

      "title": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and highly comorbid illness characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry (Box 19- ). It is marked by a later onset than other anxiety disorders (Kessler et al. 2005) and is associated with fluctuations in symptom severity and impairment (e.g., Wittchen et al. 2000). It demonstrates both a low probability of recovery (32%–58%) and a high likelihood of recurrence (45%–52%) (Rodriguez et al. 2006) over a 2- to 12-year period. GAD is associated with significant disability and impairment comparable to pure major depressive disorder (Hoffman et al. 2008) and can be more debilitating than pure substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and personality disorders, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and comorbid conditions (Grant et al. 2005). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder 300.02 F41.1 Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). The individual finds it difficult to control the worry. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months): Note: Only one item is required in children. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge. Being easily fatigued. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. Irritability. Muscle tension. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep). The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder). Individuals with GAD attempt to enhance their sense of control or preparedness through anticipation of negative outcomes or worst-case scenarios. They scan their environment for potential danger and negatively interpret neutral or ambiguous stimuli as threatening (Mathews and MacLeod 1994). Because of their lack of present moment focus, these individuals tend to ignore information in their immediate surroundings that could potentially challenge their distorted views (Borkovec and Newman 1998), which triggers emotional distress. This emotional distress is associated with many somatic features, including restlessness, fatigue, irritability, concentration difficulties, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. Overall, GAD is a serious and costly mental illness with regard to degree of distress, disability and subsequent loss of work productivity, and quality of life (Newman 2000). Thus, targeted interventions are necessary to effectively address core symptoms and associated features. In this chapter we discuss several empirically established approaches to treatment for GAD, including conventional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and integrative psychotherapy.",

Subtle personality changes tend to occur early; these include apathy, irritability and inability to pay attention. Later agitation, aggression and disinhibited behaviors may appear. We have utilized the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease to monitor a number of behavioral symptoms in 235 patients with early probable AD. Markov analyses were used to predict the probability of developing or retaining a given symptom at 6-month follow-up. The results show that the symptoms of psychopathology in AD fluctuate with time. Agitation was both the most frequent and persistent symptom, while paranoid delusions and hallucinations were less persistent. Most behavioral disturbances, except paranoid delusions, were associated with greater cognitive impairment. There was no association between depressive features and either cognitive or functional impairment. These results have important implications for the optimal treatment of the psychopathological symptoms of AD.",

As the pathology becomes more and more complicated, the psychosocial stresses, mood disturbance, and physiological dysfunction become more significant. Thus, the pathology falls into a vicious circle. Patients with FSS have common problems or characteristics, and have several overlapped diagnoses. FSS should be treated from aspects of both the similarity and the difference.",

Patients typically have preserved cognitive function during the early stages, making diagnosis more difficult when compared to other neurocognitive disorders. In this case, the patient presented predominantly with mood symptoms, delusions, and visual hallucinations. The disease course began 5 years ago with anxiety and insomnia. It developed into depressive symptoms including two suicide attempts (SAs), paranoia, and hallucinations. The diagnosis was eventually reached utilizing a thorough clinical exam, neuropsychological testing, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), and dopamine transporter (DAT) scans. We conclude that mood or psychotic symptoms that emerge, escalate, or change dramatically at later ages merit further workup to evaluate for underlying neurodegenerative disorders.",

If conservative measures and non pharmacological interventions have not been successful, is the problem severe enough to merit a trial of pharmacotherapy? For most of the BPSD considered in this chapter, there is very little evidence pertaining to treatment intervention, other than some notable trials of non-pharmacological approaches for the treatment of abnormal vocalizations.

The chapter differs from others in the AMA Guides insofar as it does not provide percentages for estimates of mental impairment because such usage suggests a certainty that does not exist. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, is a widely accepted classification system for mental disorders, but it omits context. Few clinically standardized tests can identify functional or structural effects, and neuropsychological testing is not the standard for documenting subtle impairment. How individuals manage their illness and cope with life demands are better measures of impairment than diagnostic labels or numbers and kinds of symptoms. Further, assessment requires an evaluation of the context in which the illness unfolds, including premorbid function and previous response to treatment; details about the individual's life course; review of developmental and functional deficits; character style and comorbidities such as anxiety and substance abuse; severity of precipitants, current stage of the episode, and current effectiveness of treatment; and external supports that can moderate impairment. A table lists areas of functional impairment, symptoms to consider, and patient history relevant to symptoms.",

      "title": "The Effect of Insomnia Definitions, Terminology, and Classifications on Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "There is a need for newer, more clinically useful classifications for insomnia. Identification of specific subtypes of insomnia helps anchor research, allows for prediction of prognosis/course of the condition, and may allow for individualization of treatment. Existing classifications differ, and many terms remain inadequately defined, which leads to diagnostic confusion. Historically, insomnia has been classified according to symptom type, symptom duration, and underlying cause, but these classifications have not been based on evidence of their utility, and newer research suggests the need for change. Symptoms may include difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and not feeling restored by sleep, although it has not been clear that it is possible to identify distinct subtypes of patients by symptom or that distinguishing symptom type affects the course of clinical treatment. Classification of insomnia by duration most commonly involves three categories: transient (no more than a few days), short‐term (up to 3 weeks), and long‐term (more than 3 weeks). This categorization is of uncertain utility and has been primarily based on nonempiric concerns about treatment with sedative‐hypnotic medications for periods longer than several weeks. The subtyping of insomnia in terms of whether there is an identifiable underlying cause such as a psychiatric or medical illness was based on an unproven assumption that in most instances other disorders caused insomnia. Recent studies suggest the need to revisit these classification strategies. Evidence that symptom types typically overlap and change over time complicates the categorization of subjects by whether they have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or have nonrestorative sleep. New studies of the treatment of chronic insomnia change the perspective on duration of treatment and, as a result, classification of duration of disease. Two studies of nightly pharmacotherapy for insomnia including more than 800 insomnia patients have not identified any increase in the risks after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments demonstrate long‐lasting efficacy in patients with chronic insomnia, and the development of abbreviated cognitive‐behavioral therapies, which are particularly well suited to primary care practice, have improved their applicability. Newer studies of the relationships between insomnia and associated medical and psychiatric conditions undermine the notion that insomnia is always a symptom and caused by an underlying condition. They suggest that, although it is important to identify and treat these conditions, this may not be sufficient to alleviate the insomnia, which may adversely affect the course of the associated disorder. As a result, treatment targeted specifically to the insomnia should be considered. All of these developments point to an increasing ability to tailor therapy to the particular needs of patients and to optimize the clinical management of insomnia.",

No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

The affectation of the physiological, cognitive and behavioral level, the distortion that are presented in the patients is alarming and there is no sensitization on the part of the great markets of beauty on the consequences or the sequels of this disorder. The author Phillips states that 5.8% of patients with BCD have a first-degree relative with the same pathology. These types of patients often commit acts of aggression against professionals, whether physical or verbal or legal instances because of the nonconformity of the operations performed. These types of patients with CDD do not usually perceive a single defect, but may have between 5 and 7 disconformities in different parts of their body simultaneously.",

A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is one of several disruptive psychotic disorders characterized by a broad mix of symptoms such as perceptual anomalies like hallucinations, thought distortions like delusions, disorganized speech and behaviors, and various negative symptoms such as muted expressiveness. The illness affects approximately 1% of the population. It usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and causes significant difficulties in cognition and affect at work, in social relationships, and in self-care. Its course varies across individuals, with many patients’ symptoms responding to medicine. There are many theories of the disorder’s pathophysiology, with several mechanisms invoked to account for evidence ranging from impaired performance on neuropsychological tests to brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter alterations such as in the dopamine, glutamate, and GABA systems. The etiology of schizophrenia is complex, with both genetic and environmental risk factors. While there exist other psychotic syndromes with a number of similarities, schizophrenia can be understood as a severe, persistent, and debilitating mental illness that still requires a more thorough investigation of its causal mechanisms to improve patients’ lives.",

      "abstract": "Current concepts of schizophrenia and its treatment are discussed. Schizophrenia entails negative symptoms, such as behavioral and cognitive deficits, attributed to loss of normal functions, and positive, or florid, symptoms that originate from the disturbed function of the remainder of the brain. Schizophrenia type I has positive symptoms predominating, and schizophrenia type II has negative symptoms predominating. Many atypical antipsychotics are now in Phase II and Phase III development; the prototype, clozapine, is now available. These agents challenge traditional views about drug treatment in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia may be explained by a persistent impairment in one or more neurotransmitter or neuromodulatory regulatory mechanisms, resulting in unstable or erratic neurotransmission. A more complex conceptualization of the role of the dopaminergic system makes it possible to understand the lack of biochemical tolerance to the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics, the varied time to onset of effects and prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms, and the differences in efficacy within and among patients. Drug selection on the basis of patient-specific biological markers and neuropsychological function might expedite treatment responses. Drug therapy should augment homeostatic mechanisms and restore appropriate dopaminergic responses to physiological stimuli. Atypical antipsychotics may act by stabilizing presynaptic activity at a new set point, activating prefrontal dopaminergic systems and inhibiting mesolimbic systems, or exerting pharmacologic or functional effects on other neurotransmitter and neuropeptidergic systems. The traditional view that schizophrenia is simply a manifestation of dopaminergic overactivity is inadequate. New investigative techniques and the study of atypical antipsychotics suggest that a dysregulation hypothesis may be more consistent with the complexities of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Perimenopause, the interval of irregular menstrual activity which directly precedes menopause, is characterized by widely fluctuating hormone levels amidst a large-scale decline in circulating estrogen. This phase in a woman's life is typically accompanied by physical discomforts including vasomotor symptoms, such as headaches, insomnia, and hot flushes, as well as genital atrophy. Not surprisingly, studies suggest a significant increase in mood lability for women during this time. While some evidence points toward an exacerbation of bipolar mood symptoms and an increase in schizophrenic psychosis during perimenopause, the majority of research conducted on perimenopausal mental disorders has focused on unipolar depression. Studies vary widely in methodology, definitions of menopausal status, and degrees of depression among subjects; however, the majority of findings indicate an increased susceptibility to depression during the perimenopausal transition. This greater susceptibility may be due to neuroendocrine effects of declining estrogen levels, the subjective experience of somatic symptoms resulting from this hormonal decline, and/or the more frequent occurrence of “exit” or “loss” events for women during this stage of life. At this time, more research is needed to address questions of prevalence, risk, and etiology for depression and other major mental disorders as related to the physiological and psychosocial changes associated with perimenopause.",

Cortical spreading depression (a depolarization wave across the brain cortex) is believed to be the underlying mechanism for a migraine aura, and observed vascular changes are considered epiphenomena. It is likely that there is an individual threshold for spreading depression, influenced by genetic factors.1\n\nIn migraine aura status, patients experience a large number of consecutive (mostly) visual auras, very often without headache.2 Between the auras, the patient is without symptoms. Episodes can last for weeks, and within this period several migraine auras can occur on one day. An aura status generally resolves spontaneously, but during the episodes most patients are greatly bothered by it and cannot perform their daily activities.

One patient failed to improve on daily doses of aspirin, and subsequently appeared to improve on cyproheptadine.2 Other reports of treatments for aura status are lacking.\n\nIn the last few years, seven patients with aura status visited our outpatient clinic.

      "abstract": "Defining terms is an appropriate introduction to this chapter. Hallucinations imply seeing things that are not truly present, or hearing illusory voices or music. In DLB and PDD, hallucinations are nearly always visual and manifest as seeing nonexistent people or objects, such as strangers in the house or yard. The affected individual may realize that he or she is experiencing a hallucination, but some people may not recognize that these are not real. In other disorders auditory hallucinations may be present, such as hearing voices. However, such auditory hallucinations are rare in Lewy disorders. Delusions are defined as false, often irrational beliefs. Frequently, these will have a theme, such as the conviction that someone is spying, or paranoia about friends or neighbors. A common theme is spousal infidelity, sometimes nonsensical, such as an older adult’s accusations of their mate starting an extramarital affair after 50 years of marriage. Capgras syndrome is an uncommon but striking example of delusional thinking in which the spouse or other immediate family member is accused of being an impostor. Hallucinations or delusions may occur in Parkinson’s disease in the absence of frank dementia. However, dementia is the usual setting for these problems. Hallucinations are much more common than delusions. Sometimes they are very limited, perhaps only present at night. Hallucinations are a contraindication to driving a motor vehicle, for obvious reasons. The fundamental cause of hallucinations and delusions in DLB and PDD is the Lewy neurodegenerative process. The precise region of the brain that is responsible is not known, however. These often occur in the absence of any external provocative factors. However, medications are notorious for inciting such problems in susceptible people. Chapter 7 focused on simplifying medications especially for this reason. Drugs for parkinsonism are well-known culprits, in particular two classes: (1) the dopamine agonists: pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip) and rotigotine (Neupro patch); and (2) anticholinergic drugs: trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and benztropine (Cogentin). Carbidopa/levodopa by itself may provoke hallucinations, but that is not very common unless combined with other drugs for parkinsonism.",

Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

The challenges are:\n\n\n\nAlthough “confused” or confusional state are convenient descriptions to apply to a patient, they do not have a precise medical meaning and are best avoided as diagnostic terms. The term delirium is much better defined and accepted in the classification of mental disorders.

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms: Characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both. Negative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience. However, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms. This chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. This chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

For one, the term depression is widely used to denote feelings of sadness. As with a common cold, this state of feeling depressed is experienced by everyone at one time or another. A second reason may be that forms of depression that are not clinically signifi cant, but that are more severe than simple feelings of sadness (i.e., subclinical depression), are not uncommon. A third reason probably refl ects the diversity of depression. For example, DSM–IV–TR lists 10 different types of mood disorder. Depression is common both in experience and in defi nition.",

It is not known to what extent these medical conditions precede or lead to depression. The present study proposes to identify somatic comorbities in a group of patients with major depressive disorder. The results show that many of the comorbidities identified may be metabolic risk factors for the development of other diseases or may even predispose to depression, as suggested by other studies in the literature. Patients with multiple comorbidities have a much higher risk of depression, which requires the implementation of a depression screening program and monitoring of patients at risk. Early and effective treatment leads to a lower mortality rate.",

Dichos sintomas varian desde la ansiedad e irritabilidad moderadas, hasta la depresion severa. Es frecuente que los sintomas premenstruales sean una exacerbacion de los sintomas de tipo ansioso y depresivo que estan presentes a lo largo de todo el ciclo, pero esta no es una regla. En el presente trabajo se discuten algunas hipotesis que se han emitido acerca de la relacion que existe entre los neurotransmisores, las hormonas gonadales y la depresion. Se han ensayado diversos tratamientos para el SPM, especialmente el hormonal y el psicofarmacologico. Con respecto al tratamiento hormonal, los reportes son contradictorios. Esto se puede deber a que no se ha podido demostrar que haya una anomalia hormonal simple en la etiologia del SPM. Parece mas acertada la idea de que los sintomas del SPM sean consecuencia de algunos cambios aun desconocidos en la interaccion funcional que hay entre las hormonas gonadales y los neurotransmisores cerebrales. Es por ello que los resultados del tratamiento del SPM con psicofarmacos son mas alentadores, particularmente con algunos derivados de las dibenzodiacepinas. Esto hace suponer que el control del estado ansioso/depresivo que aparece en el SPM, junto con el control del dolor periferico asociado, constituye el modelo terapeutico mas racional.",

Detailed neuropsychological characterisation in SMART syndrome is lacking and there are no published data on the course and pattern of neurocognitive recovery. Results: The acute clinical presentation was one of unstable, fluctuating neurocognitive disturbances, complicated by seizure activity, followed by a longer term lag in the recovery of focal neuropsychological deficits which, we believe, was due to the more slowly resolving cerebral effects of SMART. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first case of SMART syndrome in which neuropsychological functioning has been comprehensively and serially examined. This case is also unique due to the development of complex partial seizures. We suggest that epileptiform activity during clinical seizures should not be regarded as inconsistent with a diagnosis of SMART, provided that the seizures do not explain the onset of the other clinical and radiological features.",

      "abstract": "RésuméUne nette augmentation des cas de dépression au cours de l'année dernière a nécessité une revision du diagnostic et du traitement de ces affections. Du fait que ce sont principalement des états d'épuisements qui ont été observés, l'auteur esquisse pour commencer le diagnostic de ces manifestations dépressives, et la thérapeutique à leur appliquer. Il indique d'abord la prédominance de certains traits de caractère chez ces patients, pour montrer comment, sur ce terrain prédisposé par sa constitution ou par la névrose, l'état dépressif se développe après des années d'influences extérieures délétères, sur le plan affectif. Au point de vue psychopathologique, trois phases peuvent être distinguées plus ou moins nettement: la première hyperesthésique et asthénique, une autre psychosomatique, qui se distingue surtout par des troubles somatiques psychogènes, enfin une phase dépressive proprement dite, qui survient dans la règle par le surajoutement de chocs psychiques ou corporels de minime importance.L'auteur indique ensuite le résultat de l'étude comparée des différentes phases, ou cours des mélancolies périodiques. En confrontant, chez les patients, les phases traitées et les phases non traitées, il tente de définir l'efficacité des divers médicaments antidépressifs. Les substances étudiées présentent de nettes différences dans leur activité, en rapport avec l'étiologie et la profondeur de la dépression, ainsi qu'avec l'influence de l'inhibition ou de l'angoisse.Avec les moyens médicamenteux à disposition jusqu'à maintenant, il n'était pas possible de guérir la phase dépressive, ni de l'abréger. Tout au plus arrivait-on, par une médication continue, à estomper les symptômes. Les neuroleptiques parviennent souvent à diminuer la névrose d'angoisse chez les agités mélancoliques, mais la dépression fondamentale demeure non influencée.Récemment, Tofrānil, une substance du groupe de l'iminodibenzyle, nous a mis en mesure d'exercer une influence sur cette base pathologique, et par là de faire disparaître complètement la symptomatologie dépressive chez une partie des sujets atteints de mélancolie. La question demeure encore ouverte, de savoir si elle parvient à prolonger les intervalles libres ou à mettre le malade complètement à l'abri des rechutes. Sur la base de ses recherches, l'auteur pencherait plutôt pour la négative.L'étude comparative des différentes phases indique que les remèdes actuels ne nous permettent pas encore d'effectuer un traitement causal ou spécifique de la mélancolie. Cependant, les succès thérapeutiques récents permettent d'espérer que des substances encore plus actives seront découvertes dans un proche avenir.",

People with schizophrenia are more impaired across the lifespan compared to bipolar patients or patients with major depression. Although schizophrenia patients appear to generally function on a lower level than bipolar patients, the functional correlates of cognitive impairment are similar. There is much less research on cognition and its functional impact in depression, with the depression literature largely focusing on the impact of symptoms and only some recent studies examining cognition and functional capacity. Complicating both bipolar and major depressive disorders is the influence of mood states on cognition. Moreover, patients with SMI are often medically compromised, with higher rates of obesity and related comorbidities as well as poor lifestyles, which add further cognitive and functional implications. Cognitive impairments are known determinants of disability in SMI and a rate-limiting step in recovering from mental illness. Treatment options are reviewed in this chapter, and potential ways forward are discussed.",

In contrast to what have been previously described as “subaffective disorders,” the condition presented here develops later in life, after a premorbid history of high social function and after long-lasting stresses or multiple losses before onset. Long-term course is that of an affective disorder, sometimes ending in suicide if not treated. It is also suggested that these patients undergo a process of regression under the influence of a chronic exposure to stress. The condition was initially observed among Eastern European immigrant patients but may also occur among individuals in high-stress jobs. The name “pseudoborderline syndrome” is proposed and it is speculated that masked affective disorders may appear in the form of “pseudo-syndromes”—pseudodementia, pseudomania, pseudohypochondriasis, pseudoborderline.",

It is characterised by persistent low mood, and/or loss of pleasure in most activities over a 2-week period. Depression can be further categorised into mild, moderate and severe depression. In adults over the age of 65 years, depression tends to be as a result of comorbidities. There are various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments available for the condition. In the primary care setting, it is important to ensure that the patient is followed up regularly.

This syndrome is described as jerky ataxia and an unusual happy facial expression with pathological laughter. Severe mental retardation is a unique feature of the syndrome, together with microbrachycephaly and abnormal electroencephalographic findings with or without clinical seizures. The patients cannot speak or at most, they have a vocabulary consisting only of a few words. The genetic abnormality of AS has been located on chromosome 15q11-q13. Patients with AS mostly have deletions on the maternally derived allele (75–80%) while some of them show paternal uniparental disomy (~2%) or a rare imprinting mutation developmental disorder caused by deletion of the maternally-inherited chromosome 15q11–13. A 2.5-year-old girl is presented. Clinical suspicion of AS was raised at the age of 27 months when she presented with mental retardation and epilepsy, absence of speech, inability to gait and paroxysmal episodes of laughter. Moreover, she had facial dysmorphic features such as microbrachycephaly, mid-facial hypoplasia, macrostomia and a prominent mandible. Chromosomal analysis revealed 46 xx with the deletion of 15q chromosome (15q11q13-snrpn/ic) Our patient met the classical phenotype and genotype of AS.",

We report the perceived time of a voluntary action and its consequence in eight schizophrenic patients and matched controls.The patients showed an unusually strong binding effect between actions and consequences. Specifically, the temporal interval between action and consequence appeared shorter for patients than for controls.

      "title": "Migraine: A Chronic Sympathetic Nervous System Disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective.—To determine the degree of diagnostic and clinical similarity between chronic sympathetic nervous system disorders and migraine. Background.—Migraine is an episodic syndrome consisting of a variety of clinical features that result from dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system. During headache‐free periods, migraineurs have a reduction in sympathetic function compared to nonmigraineurs. Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is also the major feature of rare neurological disorders such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. There are no known reports in the medical literature, however, comparing sympathetic nervous system function in individuals with migraine, pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy. Methods.—A detailed review of the literature was performed to compare the results of a wide variety of diagnostic tests and clinical signs that have been described in these 3 heretofore unrelated disorders. Results.—The data indicate that migraine shares significant diagnostic and clinical features with both pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy, yet represents a distinct subtype of chronic sympathetic dysfunction. Migraine is most similar to pure autonomic failure in terms of reduced supine plasma norepinephrine levels, peripheral adrenergic receptor supersensitivity, and clinical symptomatology directly related to sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. The peripheral sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is much more severe in pure autonomic failure than in migraine. Migraine differs from both pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy in that migraineurs retain the ability, although suboptimal, to increase plasma norepinephrine levels following physiological stressors. Conclusions.—The major finding of the present study is that migraine is a disorder of chronic sympathetic dysfunction, sharing many diagnostic and clinical characteristics with pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. However, the sympathetic nervous system dysfunction in migraine differs from pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy in that occurs in an anatomically intact system. It is proposed that the sympathetic dysfunction in migraine relates to an imbalance of sympathetic co‐transmitters. Specifically, it is suggested that a migraine attack is characterized by a relative depletion of sympathetic norepinephrine stores in conjunction with an increase in the release of other sympathetic cotransmitters such as dopamine, prostaglandins, adenosine triphosphate, and adenosine. An enhanced understanding of the sympathetic dysfunction in migraine may help to more effectively diagnose, prevent, and/or treat migraine and other types of headache.",

Loss of motivation is sometime a depression in aged people, associated with a dysexecutive syndrome or, elsewhere, aggressiveness can reveals a hostile depression. At a worst stage of the disease, in particular, when a dementia is latent, confusion is present.

      "title": "Pruritus Ani",
      "abstract": "Summary Pruritus ani, although it presents as the only symptom, never occurs alone, but is associated with bizarre gastrointestinal symptoms and sexual disorders. Depressive and paranoid trends are common. It is the leading symptom in a syndrome. This syndrome exists in its own right. No distinct personality type could be established; it was found to occur without personality disorder, in psychoneurotic and prepsychotic personalities, and in frank psychoses. Its origin can be traced to a reactivation in adult life of infantile (unconscious) fantasies about procreation centering round the anal function, which precede genital interest and knowledge of sex. These \"cloacal\" fantasies are revived in their original primitive mode, as bodily sensations rather than ideas; the symptoms thus represent the fantasy. They appear as distressing somatic symptoms because such archaic fantasies are incompatible with reality. A breakthrough into consciousness is thus prevented and psychotic delusions avoided. Revival of procreation fantasies must be more deeply disturbing in the man than in the woman; this is borne-out by the greater severity, longer duration, and preponderance of male cases. The syndrome is capable of reduction by psychotherapy. The structure of this syndrome is simpler than that of the psychoneuroses. By the absence of overt anxiety it can be separated from anxiety hysteria, and by the absence of true obsessions, with their tendency to displacement and spread, from obsessive-compulsive neurosis. Secondary gain is absent. Its psychopathology suggests a hypochondriacal syndrome with specific content. Freud classed hypochondria among the \"actualneuroses\" to which psychoanalysis had little to contribute. In psychiatry proper hypochondria is also a stepchild. Brachet speaks of it as a \"disorder of the imagination.\" Gillespie8 defines \"the syndrome of hypochondria\" as, \"A mental preoccupation with a real or supposititious physical or mental disorder, a discrepancy between the degree of preoccupation and the grounds for it, so that the former is far in excess of what is justified, and an affective condition best described as interest with conviction and consequent concern, and with an indifference to the opinion of the environment, including irresponsiveness to persuasion… usually inaccessible to psychotherapy… it affects men predominantly… it can shade into schizophrenia… in its mild form it is often erroneously diagnosed as anxiety neurosis or hysteria.\" This description neatly condenses our findings on patients with pruritus ani. It should perhaps be added that in the clinical example given by Gillespie of hypochondria there was, besides intestinal symptoms of \"a bizarre nature\" and \"persecutory ideas of a peculiar kind referring to his gullet and genital organs, \" also \"a tearing away at the anus.\"",

      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

This study was designed to meet several of the criticisms of those previous studies. Using Research Diagnostic Criteria, we compared the sleep patterns of schizophrenic patients with those of normal controls and patients with major depressive disorder and schizoaffective disorder. All patients were medication free, and REM latency was explicitly defined using both strict and lenient criteria. Chronically ill paranoid or undifferentiated schizophrenics could not be distinguished from patients with major depressive disorder or schizoaffective disorder using any definition of REM latency. These results were not due to longer REM latency in the particular sample of patients with major depressive disorder. They had abnormally low REM latencies; however, the schizophrenic patients showed similar decrements. These data cast serious doubt on the specificity of short REM latency as a biological marker for major depressive disorder.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychological symptoms, then a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] should be considered, according to the Centers for Disease Control case definition [1994]. Actually, the diagnosis of CFS is only a clinical diagnosis, since laboratory tests are only useful to identify and/or exclude alternative diseases with a well defined etiology, which may explain the same symptoms. The CFS onset is explained by different etiopathogenetic hypotheses: toxic exposure well documented in some cases [e.g., ciguatera poisoning, workers exposure to solvents and other chemicals], infectious agents [e.g., Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses, coxsackievirus, etc.], immunologic factors [CFS = Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome-CFIDS], neuroendocrine alterations [significant dysfunction of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis has been observed in CFS patients]. Also the psychiatric hypothesis is still credited by CFS researchers. However, a concurrent diagnosis of major depression should exclude a diagnosis of CFS according to the last case definition. Furthermore the depressive syndrome often observed in CFS patients is often secondary to the malaise and disability. Although the various pathogenetic hypotheses are not necessarily in contrast, it seems more likely that CFS is a heterogeneous disease, probably multifactorial, or that CFS includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. Among the several questions which are still unexplained there is one of remarkable importance about the pathogenetic substrate of CFS symptoms and particularly of “fatigue.” Furthermore, it is still unclear whether the fatigue or the other neuromuscular symptoms [e.g., myalgia] have a central or a peripheral origin. Most of the alterations described so far in CFS point out a clinical and a functional impairment of the central nervous system. However, our own observations at the Reference Center for CFS Study of Chieti University indicate the existence of peripheral alterations [neuromuscular] and this supports the theory about a heterogeneity of the CFSs.",

D'ou la necessite avant tout interventionnisme, d'un diagnostic prealable prenant en compte la structure du sujet, le concept de nevrose gardant toute sa legitimite dans son opposition a la psychose notamment. En dehors de l'evacuation du concept de nevrose, une autre raison concourt a l'eclatement actuel du concept de nevrose obsessionnelle. Les TOC nous dit-on, se rencontrent chez des patients fort differents et non pas seulement chez ceux qui presentent une Personnalite Obsessionnelle Compulsive (POC). Nous avons voulu rappeler que le caractere dans sa dimension inconsciente ne recoupe pas necessairement la notion de P. O. C apprehendee essentiellement sur des criteres comportementaux. Nonobstant, le diagnostic en psychanalyse s'etablit a partir d'un sujet pris dans sa singularite et non en se centrant exclusivement sur les symptomes. Qu'un nevrose soit la proie d'obsessions ne signe pas a coup sur sa structure obsessionnelle ! Le caractere comme mode constant de rapport a l'Autre parait meme au plus pres de temoigner de la structure du fantasme obsessionnel, ce qui etait deja entrevu par Freud",

Again, there is a group of patients who complain of these symptoms but who show little affective disorder. In these patients the autonomic symptoms are provoked by specific situations which are not particularly stressful to normal people, e.g. nausea occurs when eating in company or diarrhoea when travelling; outside these specific situations symptoms do not occur.

Are hysterical manifestations disappearing or do they take other forms? This question raises semantic and phenomenological problems concerning hysteria. A review of the literature shows the complexity and precariousness of some definitions, the question raised by associated organic disorders and the compounding influences of other nosological entities, such as depression and psychosomatic disorders. Clinical histories from the records of a psychiatric hospital for the period 1910-1929 were compared with those for the period 1970-1980. The results of the study were surprising with respect to the similarity of epidemiological profiles. If it can be concluded that hysterical manifestations are not disappearing, then the study confirms the evolution of symptomatology which, especially in women, takes atypical forms of depressive, neurovegetative or psychosomatic disorders. In males, hysterical symptoms are of a more acute nature and frequently occur in dependent, immature or infantile personalities, whilst in the past they were more chronic and frequently associated with more serious personality disorders.",

The main symptoms are emotional liability, dysphoria and anxiety. Objectives To review PMDD for helping in the differential diagnosis between this disease and classical anxiety disorders. Methods It was made a clinical review about differential diagnosis and comorbilities on PMDD in specialized literature and Pub-Med. Results PMDD causes significant distress and impairment in social or occupational functioning the first week following menstruation. In relation with differential diagnosis on PMDD, on the one hand, several organic diseases could produce the same symptoms than PMDD: for example gynecological pathology as dysmenorrhea or menopausal transition, endocrinological diseases as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism and some hormonal treatment including hormonal contraceptives. In addition, a variety of medical disorders are concomitant pathologies that could be associated with PMDD (eg, migraine; epilepsy, asthma, allergies, systemic exertion intolerance disease, chronic fatigue syndrome; irritable bowel syndrome). These pathologies are exacerbated just before or during menstruation. On the other hand, several psychiatric disorders as bipolar disorder, major depression, dystimia, and anxiety disorders could get worse on the premenstrual phase. Conclusions In relation with the diagnosis of PMDD, it seems necessary to consider various differential diagnosis such as psychiatric, gynecological and endocrine disorders because of all of them share like symptoms. For this purpose it is very important to make both a good clinical history and a comprehensive physical examination to offer the most accurate diagnosis and treatment.

      "title": "Physical performance and disability in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Despite 50 years of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, schizophrenia remains one of the leading causes of disability. Schizophrenia is also a life-shortening illness, caused mainly by poor physical health and its complications. The end result is a considerably reduced lifespan that is marred by reduced levels of independence, with few novel treatment options available. Disability is a multidimensional construct that results from different, and often interacting, factors associated with specific types and levels of impairment. In schizophrenia, the most poignant and well characterized determinants of disability are symptoms, cognitive and related skills deficits, but there is limited understanding of other relevant factors that contribute to disability. Here we conceptualize how reduced physical performance interacts with aging, neurobiological, treatment-emergent, and cognitive and skills deficits to exacerbate ADL disability and worsen physical health. We argue that clearly defined physical performance components represent underappreciated variables that, as in mentally healthy people, offer accessible targets for exercise interventions to improve ADLs in schizophrenia, alone or in combination with improvements in cognition and health. And, finally, due to the accelerated aging pattern inherent in this disease - lifespans are reduced by 25 years on average - we present a training model based on proven training interventions successfully used in older persons. This model is designed to target the physical and psychological declines associated with decreased independence, coupled with the cardiovascular risk factors and components of the metabolic syndrome seen in schizophrenia due to their excess prevalence of obesity and low fitness levels.",

      "title": "Molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in status epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency, characterized by continuous or intermittent seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures, which can result in death or neurologic sequelae. In about one-third of patients, SE is unresponsive to sequential treatment with first- and second-line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The two most important variables that influence the response of SE to AEDs are the underlying etiology and the duration of SE (Neligan & Shorvon, 2008). With respect to etiology, acute structural brain disorders (e.g., encephalitis, stroke, and trauma) resulting in SE in previously nonepileptic patients are particularly likely to be refractory. Conversely, in cases of acute SE in previously nonepileptic patients, for which no etiology is found, the outcome is usually much better. With respect to duration of SE, the longer the seizure persists (typically >1 h), the more likely is the seizure to be unresponsive to AED therapy, the higher is the mortality, and the worse is the prognosis in survivors. Similar observations have been reported in rat models of SE. In rats, SE can be induced with chemical agents or by electrical stimulation. Chemical models of SE include systemic administration of the convulsants kainic acid or pilocarpine, whereas electrical models include hippocampal or amygdala stimulation via depth electrodes. In such models, seizures rapidly become self-sustaining and continue long after the withdrawal of the convulsive stimulus. Various molecular and functional changes are thought to play a role in the transition from single seizures to self-sustained SE and in the development of time-dependent pharmacoresistance in rat SE models (Chen & Wasterlain, 2006; Wasterlain & Chen, 2008). These changes include alterations in the functional properties of hippocampal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors and enhanced trafficking of GABAA receptors (or receptor subunits) from the synaptic membrane to the cytosol, resulting in a loss of GABA-mediated inhibition. At the same time, glutamate receptor subunits, including alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtypes, move to the synaptic membrane where they form additional excitatory receptors. These changes are likely to explain progressive resistance to AEDs acting on GABAA receptors, whereas anticonvulsant NMDA or AMPA antagonists remain highly effective in terminating SE (Wasterlain & Chen, 2008). These findings, however, do not easily explain resistance to AEDs, such as phenytoin, that do not primarily act via GABA receptors. It is conceivable that AED targets other than GABA or glutamate receptors are also affected by sustained seizure activity. For instance, molecular and functional changes in voltage-dependent sodium channels, which are targets of phenytoin and various other major AEDs, have been found after a pilocarpine-induced SE in rats (Ellerkmann et al., 2003; Remy & Beck, 2006). Furthermore, a decrease in surface expression of potassium channels has been described after prolonged SE (Lugo et al., 2008). Another explanation for the progressive loss of AED efficacy with ongoing SE activity would be increased expression of drug efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) at the blood–brain barrier, which would decrease brain concentrations of AEDs that are substrates for Pgp (Löscher, 2007). However, recent experiments in two rat models of SE did not result in any evidence supporting this possibility (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008; Kuteykin-Teplyakov et al., 2009). Pgp expression at brain capillary endothelial cells was not increased during or shortly after SE, but only 2 days following SE. This was substantiated by studying the mRNA expression of the genes (Mdr1a, Mdr1b) encoding for Pgp in rats. Furthermore, the selective Pgp inhibitor, tariquidar, did not counteract resistance of a pilocarpine-induced SE to phenobarbital or phenytoin (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008). In our hands, the only effective treatment for terminating a pilocarpine-induced SE was a combination of phenobarbital and diazepam (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008), which may be explained by the fact that phenobarbital, in addition to modulating GABAA receptors, blocks glutamatergic excitation at AMPA/kainate receptors (Rogawski & Löscher, 2004), so that combining these two AEDs results in a synergistic effect on GABAA receptors plus an antiglutamatergic effect. Other potential mechanisms of drug resistance of SE include induction of proinflammatory mediators and neuronal damage. SE has been shown to induce cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα); complement; and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, that is, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins in the brain (Vezzani & Granata, 2005). The induction of these mediators may be involved in alterations in the blood–brain barrier, increased neuronal hyperexcitability, and neuronal degeneration, all of which may affect AED efficacy. However, at least in our hands, induction of proinflammatory mediators by SE did not develop rapidly enough to explain resistance of SE to AEDs (Kuteykin-Teplyakov et al., 2009). These alterations, however, may be critically involved in the development of epilepsy and neuronal damage after SE, as indicated by the disease-modifying effects of treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, administered after a pilocarpine-induced SE (Jung et al., 2006). Interestingly, neurodegeneration developing after SE could be significantly reduced or prevented by treatment with the NMDA-antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine), administered together with diazepam after kainate- or pilocarpine-induced SE (Brandt et al., 2003; Bankstahl et al., 2008), substantiating that SE-induced release of glutamate is involved in brain damage. Therefore, combining diazepam with an NMDA antagonist such as ketamine may not only be an advantageous treatment for terminating SE (Martin & Kapur, 2008; Wasterlain & Chen, 2008), but may also prevent part of the long-term consequences of SE. Apart from molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, the severity of SE may play a role in the response to AED treatment. We recently demonstrated in rats that SE induced by pilocarpine was more resistant to AEDs than an electrically induced SE, and also induced more severe brain damage than determined in the electrical model (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008). So one may speculate that drug resistance, at least in part, is a mere expression of higher SE severity (and/or the severity of the underlying condition), rather than of molecular or functional alterations developing as a result of sustained seizure activity. In conclusion, mechanisms of drug resistance in SE are only incompletely understood. Important variables that influence the response of SE to AEDs are the underlying etiology and the duration of SE, but several other variables may be involved, including disease-related, patient-related, and drug-related factors (Table 1). Initiating treatment of SE with two drugs that have different mechanisms of action (e.g., a benzodiazepine plus a barbiturate or an NMDA antagonist) might increase chances of success. It is hoped that a better understanding of the factors and mechanisms involved in refractory SE might help us to improve its treatment.

      "abstract": "Persistent depressive disorder is a newly coined term in the DSM-5 to capture what was originally known as dysthymia and chronic major depression. This disorder has been poorly understood, and its classification has evolved due to the complicated and ever-evolving nature of the nosology of depressive disorders. In the past, this disease was considered a depressed personality state, but it is likely better conceptualized as a disease state rather than a personality disorder (permanent, pervasive way of approaching the world). This change is reflected in the history of the diagnosis as the DSM-II originally identified it as a personality disorder. It was not until the DSM-III that dysthymic disorder was defined as a mild chronic depression lasting longer than 2 years. The origin of the word dysthymia dates back to its Greek roots, with the first use of the word referring to psychiatry occurring by CF Fleming around 1844.",

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated.

Are anxiety and depression entirely separate disorders which may co-exist in the same patient? Does anxiety give rise to the depression? Does depression give rise to the anxiety? Are anxiety and depression manifestations of a single underlying disorders, dysphoria? Therapeutic responsivity to specific drugs suggest: relief of anxiety may reveal an underlying depression; anxiety syndromes which fail to respond to anxiolytics may respond to antidepressants; short-term relief of depression may occur at times with anxiolytics. Proposed mechanisms of action of depression and anxiety also involve overlap of the elements and systems involved. The basic sensations of pain, anticipation, depression and euphoria alone or in combination are sufficient to account for the dysphoric feelings and emotions when these sensations are associated with specific mental content. These may be related in turn to biogenic amines, beta-endorphins, diazepam receptors and possibly cocaine receptors.",

Dissociative amnesia will include dissociative fugue as a subtype, since fugue is a rare disorder that always involves amnesia but does not always include confused wandering or loss of personality identity. Depersonalization disorder will include derealization as well, since the two often co-occur. A dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), defined by the presence of depersonalization or derealization in addition to other PTSD symptoms, is being recommended, based upon new epidemiological and neuroimaging evidence linking it to an early life history of adversity and a combination of frontal activation and limbic inhibition.

      "abstract": "Introduction Multiple sclerosis(MS)is a chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. Depression is one of the most common psychiatric conditions associated with MS. Lifetime prevalence of major depression has been estimated to be around 50%. Objectives Although the prevalence of depression in MS patients has been shown by many studies, there has not been a case in the literature demonstrating the onset of MS disease with depressive symptoms. In this article, a case of multiple sclerosis (undiagnosed before) presenting as depression in a young woman is presented and discussed. Methods An eighteen years-old female patient visited the emergency room of Erenkoy Mental and Neurological Diseases Hospital with complaints of unhappiness,malaise,anhedonia,introversion,sleepiness,lack of appetite and nausea. She was admitted to another hospital one and a half years ago with similar complaints and duloxetine 30 mg/day treatment was started. The patient, who did not benefit from this treatment, stopped using the drug by herself and did not consult a doctor again. Her complaints regressed over time without treatment.Her current symptoms started four days prior to her visit. She had no other medically diagnosed condition. No pathology was detected in the emergency blood test parameters of the patient.Her brain tomography was normal. The patient, who had periventricular ovoid hyperintense lesions on cranial MRI, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and was admitted to the neurology unit of our hospital. The lumbar puncture was performed during the hospitalization, oligoclonal band positivity was detected. The IgG index was found to be increased at CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). She underwent pulse steroid therapy for seven days. The patient was discharged since her symptoms regressed after treatment. Results Here we present a case of MS presenting as depression in a young woman. Depression is a very common, and very important comorbidity in multiple sclerosis. The etiology of depression in MS is likely to be multifactorial, and to include biological, psychological, and social determinants. Although the relationship between depression and MS has been clearly demonstrated in all of these studies, there is no case of MS presenting as depression in the literature. Conclusions We know that depression may occur as a prodromal symptom in some organic diseases that affect brain such as dementia and Parkinson. In this case, we wanted to emphasize that organic etiological research is necessary for patients who present with psychiatric complaints for the first time, and that psychiatric complaints may be a symptom of organic diseases that may affect the brain.

Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, facial apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational [IA] and ideomotor apraxias [IMA]), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia [LKA]), or alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 hours apart, one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years, diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "title": "Musical Hallucination in a Patient With Frontal Lobe Meningioma",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Many conditions can mimic psychiatric symptoms. Amongst them, intracranial mass and space occupying lesions have a significant importance. Aggression and hallucination are seen in association with a basal frontal lesion, and may mimic psychotic syndromes. Case Presentation: A 37-year-old man with no previous mental illness presented with a month history of headache, blurred vision, diplopia, aggression, loss of interest, fatigue, insomnia, and depressed mood. He was suffering from daily auditory hallucination which described as musical hallucination lasting about an hour per day. The headache was tension-type which appeared swinging, two times per week lasting 30 minutes. After auditory hallucination, the patient disclosed nausea, vomiting, and transient loss of consciousness. He referred from a neurologist, because, conventional therapy for the patient had not response. There were no other neurological symptoms or deficits. The results of neurologic examination including evaluation of the cranial nerves as well as head and neck examination were normal; But, psychiatric symptoms developed. Therefore, he was admitted to the psychiatric ward. The patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic feature by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV criteria and received psychiatric treatment. He started on antipsychotic agent (olanzapine 5 mg tablet/bid), antidepressant (sertraline 50 mg tablet/qhs) and valproate sodium 200 mg tablet/bid for treatment of aggression and headaches. After five days of admission, primary symptoms of headache and auditory hallucination were better but diplopia and blurred vision were still present. Ophthalmology examination revealed. The pupils were round, isochoric, and normoreactive to light and accommodation, and there was no sign of a relative afferent pupillary defect. Ophthalmoscopy showed a papilledema in both eyes. In order to rule out the intracranial pressure and their causes, neuroimaging was requested. An emergent noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) image of the head revealed a hyperdense mass in midfrontal convexity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with and without intravenous gadolinium enhancement further delineated the CT findings and highlighted a large avidly enhancing midline mass within the frontal region measuring approximately 48×50×42 mm in axial dimension, consistent with a meningioma. The patient discharged from psychiatric ward with necessary advices and was admitted to the neurosurgery ward for further evaluation. A first psychosis episode is a clinical condition with principal indication for cerebral CT-scan. Discussion: Meningioma is a common intracranial tumor with a variety of histomorphologic growth patterns, which are usually easily recognized. The three most common symptoms are headaches, mental status changes, and paresis. Aggression and hallucination are seen in association with a basal frontal lesion and may mimic psychotic syndromes like hypomania and schizophrenia. A first psychosis episode is a clinical condition with principal indication for cerebral CT-scan.",

      "title": "The psychosocial effects of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)",
      "abstract": "What are Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures? A recent research study conducted by Flinders University explores the experience of a disability which is both hidden and lacks physiological ‘evidence’; a condition which is not understood by health professionals, and results in individuals feeling confused and isolated. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) (also called pseudoseizures) are events resembling epileptic seizures, which are not associated with ictal electrical discharges in the brain but by psychological processes. PNES may be triggered by anxiety, psychological tension and heightened defence against intense emotions. In some cases PNES may be a result of psychological trauma, previous psychiatric history, physical and sexual abuse or posttraumatic stress disorder (Fiszman, Alves-Leon, Nunes, Dandrea, & Figueira, 2004). Health professionals often overlook PNES due to the common misconception that they are “fake” (Benbadis, 2005) or are categorized as a “non-disease” (i.e. not epilepsy) (Bodde, et al., 2009). However, this is a very real condition, with considerable psychosocial implications. People diagnosed with PNES feel anger, shame, helplessness, and experience suicidal ideation (thinking about suicide with some intent but without actually making plans to commit suicide) (Thompson, Isaac, Rowse, Tooth, & Reuber, 2009). Stigma is often attached with this label, fuelled by poor understanding and little education and support following diagnosis (Benbadis, 2010). One complicating factor is that an individual may experience both PNES and epileptic seizures. 15% of people with diagnosed PNES also have epilepsy (Benbadis, 2010), and it is estimated that 10 to 50% of individuals with “intractable seizures” (seizures not adequately controlled by AEDs) have either lone PNES or a combination of epileptic seizures and PNES (LaFrance, et al., 2006). Co-morbidity can cause significant diagnostic and management issues, with health professionals often unable to accurately identify the cause of seizures, and thereby communicate and manage them appropriately. The current study aimed to further explore the psychosocial effects of PNES and their implications for the development of appropriate multidisciplinary support and management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Juvenile general paralysis is of interest as illustrating one of the many ways in which syphilis may produce its detrimental effect on the human race. The disease may commence at a very early age; according to Thomson, progressive symptoms may be evident in children as young as three years. Males and females are victims in practically equal proportions. The symptoms are very similar to those of the adult form, progressive dementia being very marked; such variations as are present are due to the more undeveloped mental state of youth, and on the whole it corresponds to the demented or confused type of the adult. Periods of acute excitement, or of mental depression, are met with, and epileptiform seizures, which may be present at any stage, are often observed. Delusions of persecution are not uncommon, and grandiose delusions occur; hallucinations are also evident occasionally at some time during the course. In the younger patients a type of advancing spastic diplegia is most common, and even in older cases spastic symptoms are more prominent than in the adult form. The pathological appearances in the nervous system have the same characteristics as those seen in cases of mature age. The duration is usually from two to four years, although sometimes it may be more protracted.",

      "title": "Management of acute extrapyramidal effects induced by antipsychotic drugs",
      "abstract": "The management of acute extrapyramidal effects (EPEs) induced by antipsychotic drugs is reviewed. EPEs associated with antipsychotics include acute dystonias, pseudoparkinsonism, and akathisia. Acute dystonias consist of abnormal muscle spasms and postures and usually occur three to five days after antipsychotic therapy begins or the dosage is increased. Acute dystonias should be treated with anticholinergic medications or benzodiazepines. Antipsychotic-induced pseudoparkinsonism has the same clinical appearance as idiopathic parkinsonism. Symptoms generally appear within the first three months. Pseudoparkinsonism is managed by lowering the anti-psychotic dosage or by adding an anticholinergic agent or a mantadine; switching to a low-potency agent or an atypical antipsychotic may also help. Akathisia is characterized by subjective feelings of restlessness and anxiety and objective signs of motor activity, such as inability to sit still. This EPE appears days to weeks after antipsychotic exposure begins and can be difficult to manage. If reduction of the antipsychotic dosage or a switch to a less potent antipsychotic is not practical or effective, an anticholinergic, beta-blocker, or benzodiazepine may be added. Lipophilic beta-blockers, especially propranolol and metoprolol, appear to be the most effective treatments. Anticholinergic agents are commonly given to prevent acute dystonias, especially in high-risk patients, but long-term prophylaxis is controversial. Atypical antipsychotics may have less potential to induce EPEs. Options in the management of antipsychotic-associated EPEs include using the lowest effective dosage of antipsychotic, treating the reactions with medications, and changing the antipsychotic to one with less potential for inducing EPEs.",

They are, for one part, the direct consequence of the brain lesions, but, for another part, they result from the psychological reactions of the patients to their cognitive deficits or their relational difficulties with their family or carers. Despite speech disorder and mind disruption, patients with severe dementia still have a psychic and relational life, which is expressed through BPSD. Many BPSD are of short duration and can be improved by a better understanding, psychological and behavioral approach. However, psychotropic drugs are often useful or necessary, but, due to the frailty of the patients with severe dementia, their use should be very cautious.",

      "abstract": "The premenstrual and menstrual periods are associated with increased psychiatric disturbances, both of a psychotic and neurotic nature. Pre-existing psychosis can worsen in the premenstrual period, or, as we describe in the following case report, a psychosis can occur in the premenstrual period with complete remission once the bleeding has ceased. The role of menstruation in the timing and pathogenesis of the major psychoses is largely ignored in present-day psychiatry. In the nineteenth century, however, psychosis coincident with menstruation was thought to merit its own special term ( Menstruationpsychose ), and Kraepelin himself described the importance of the association (Kraepelin, 1909). In contrast, premenstrual tension has been the subject of continuous interest since the term was first used by Frank (1931), and there have been cases described of premenstrual tension in association with psychosis. Williams &amp; Weeks (1952), for example, reported on 16 cases where the psychosis was characteristic of mania or catatonic schizophrenia, and more recently, Price &amp; DiMarzio (1986) found that 60% of a group of rapidly cycling manic-depressive psychotics suffered from severe premenstrual tension. Psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle without concomitant symptoms of premenstrual tension has also been described. Lingjaerde &amp; Bredland (1954) presented a case of a 24-year-old woman who developed a manic–depressive (manic-type) psychosis synchronous with her menstrual cycle, after childbirth. A Japanese cohort of patients diagnosed as suffering from “periodic psychosis” (Wakoh et al, 1960) showed significant correlation between acute psychosis and the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The premenstrual period is also known to exacerbate pre-existing psychosis; Ota et al (1954) and Gregory (1957) have shown a significant increase in psychotic behaviour in the last 10 days of the menstrual cycle. We present a patient with a schizophreniform psychosis occurring irregularly but concomitant with her menstrual cycle, with total remission during the interval stage.",

      "title": "The Epidemiology of Acute Stress Disorder and Other Early Responses to Trauma in Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute stress disorder (ASD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by exposure to a traumatic event followed by symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-arousal, peritraumatic dissociation, and impairment in functioning. ASD's time-limited duration (two days to one month) makes it distinct from but related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed after one month. ASD's brief duration has contributed to a dearth of large-scale, population-based studies. Smaller studies have sought to determine rates of ASD after specific events in select populations; others have focused on ASD's role in predicting PTSD. Much can be learned from existing epidemiological studies. ASD's prevalence varies from 3% in a population of accident victims to 59% in female sexual assault victims. Female gender is a key risk factor; marital status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status have also been associated with ASD in some studies. Comorbidities include depressive and anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.",

      "title": "Pharmacological treatment of poststroke pathological laughing and crying",
      "abstract": "A 60-year-old man with left-sided limb weakness after a stroke was referred for assessment and treatment of depression. The patient reported that, after his stroke 2 weeks ago, he has been crying “for no reason” several times a day. He described that the crying spells last several seconds and cannot be resisted. The patient denies depressed mood or symptoms consistent with a mood disorder. On examination, stereotyped paroxysms of crying lasting 5–10 seconds were noted during the interview, incongruent to any emotional themes discussed. The patient was diagnosed with pathological crying and was started on citalopram 10 mg orally at night. On follow-up, he reported that his crying spells stopped within days of initiating the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication.\r\n\r\nPathological laughing and crying (PLC) is one of the most common poststroke affective disorders. The cardinal feature of this disorder is a markedly lowered threshold for exhibiting affective behaviour (crying, laughing or both) that is out of proportion to underlying feelings of happiness or sadness. At an extreme, the expression of affect is completely incongruous to the reported underlying emotional experience. Pure pathological crying is by far the most common presentation, representing approximately 80% of cases of post-stroke PLC. Estimates of the prevalence of PLC vary from 7% to up to 48.5% of stroke survivors, with a greater prevalence found in inpatient populations and during the acute post-stroke period.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is important to consider the presence of a depressive episode in people who present with excessive emotionality, most people with PLC do not have a diagnosable mood disorder, and many do not manifest depressive symptoms at all.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of PLC is unknown. Converging lines of evidence suggest that monoaminergic neurotransmission is altered in those who develop PLC after a stroke.\r\n\r\nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of PLC have been reported in the English literature. In pooled data of 93 people from these placebo-controlled trials of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, 96% of patients who received antidepressant medication demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the number of crying episodes at the end of the treatment trials, compared with 27.5% of patients who received placebo, yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes after a stroke, often within days, rather than the weeks typically expected before antidepressant effects are seen. SSRIs should be regarded as the first-line choice when treating poststroke PLC, given the greater tolerability of SSRIs and their lower propensity to have effects on the cardiovascular system, compared with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. The doses of the SSRI medications that were effective in treating PLC in the studies described above (fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg and citalopram 10–20 mg) are at the low end of the therapeutic range used for treating depression. Case reports suggest that bupropion, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and lamotrigine may be effective for PLC in people who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, SSRIs.\r\n\r\nThere are limited data to guide clinicians on how long patients should remain on treatment. For most stroke patients, the natural history of PLC is for the symptoms to gradually improve over time. However, it is estimated that 10%–15% of people continue to manifest symptoms a year after a stroke. Reports have suggested that PLC can reemerge after discontinuing the antidepressant drug, whereas reinstatement of the medication leads to swift amelioration of these symptoms. The need for long-term treatment needs to be evaluated on an individual basis.\r\n\r\nPeter Giacobbe, MD Alastair Flint, MB Department of Psychiatry University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Toronto, Ont.",

Patienten mit vorbestehender kognitiver Leistungsminderung sind häufiger betroffen. Ein Zusammenhang mit der Entstehung einer Demenz ist aber bisher nicht nachgewiesen. Die pathophysiologischen Mechanismen sind ungeklärt. Anästhetika oder die Art der Narkose haben keinen entscheidenden Einfluss, ebenso ist die Art des operativen Eingriffs eher sekundär. Die kognitive Reserve des einzelnen Patienten scheint aber einen entscheidenden Stellenwert für das Entstehen einer POCD darzustellen. Therapiemöglichkeiten sind bisher nicht bekannt.

Intermediate forms and subgroups have begun to emerge, each with its own course and prognosis. But so far classification systems have not adopted further distinctions.

      "title": "Comparación entre el tratamiento continuo y el intermitente con citalopram para el trastorno disfórico premenstrual",
      "abstract": "El trastorno disforico premenstrual (TDPM) es una entidad psiquiatrica que se caracteriza por la presencia de sintomas fisicos, emocionales y conductuales unos dias antes de la menstruacion y que desaparecen en el transcurso de la misma. Los sintomas animicos, tales como irritabilidad, tristeza y labilidad emocional, son primordiales para hacer el diagnostico y para diferenciarlo del sindrome premenstrual (SPM) que es una entidad ginecologica en la cual los sintomas son principalmente fisicos. En el TDPM tambien se presentan sintomas somaticos tales como dolor en los senos, edema y sensacion de distension abdominal, pero estos no son primordiales para el diagnostico. Ademas, es importante considerar el deterioro que el trastorno ocasiona, ya que aproximadamente 80% de las mujeres pueden quejarse de molestias premenstruales de menor intensidad. Se han descrito varios patrones sintomaticos del TDPM y todos coinciden en que los sintomas estan ausentes durante la fase folicular. El TDPM es el unico trastorno que de acuerdo con el DSM-IV debe diagnosticarse prospectivamente, mediante diarios de sintomas. La etiologia del diagnostico es aun desconocida, pero debido a que los sintomas se encuentran ligados al ciclo menstrual se piensa que las hormonas sexuales podrian estar implicadas en la etiologia de dicho trastorno. Ademas, en estudios realizados en animales, se ha observado que al inhibir la funcion ovarica los sintomas desaparecen y que reaparecen cuando se restituye el ambiente hormonal mediante la administracion de hormonas sexuales exogenas. Asimismo, se ha observado en diversos estudios, que existe una interrelacion entre los sistemas hormonales y los sistemas de neurotransmision, y que es la serotonina el neurotransmisor que mas se ve implicado en la etiopatogenia del trastorno. Con respecto al tratamiento de esta entidad, se ha sugerido una gran cantidad de intervenciones terapeuticas que incluyen medidas higienico dieteticas, medicamentos sindromaticos como diureticos o analgesicos, agentes hormonales y antidepresivos. De estos ultimos los que con mayor constancia han demostrado su eficacia, son los inhibidores selectivos de la recaptura de serotonina (ISRS). Sin embargo, aun existe controversia respecto a si los farmacos deben emplearse unicamente durante el periodo sintomatico lo que se ha llamado tratamiento intermitente o bien prolongar su uso a lo largo de todo el ciclo menstrual (tratamiento continuo). Ambos tipos de tratamiento se justifican teoricamente y existen estudios tanto en apoyo del tratamiento continuo como del tratamiento intermitente. Hay, asimismo, estudios que han documentado resultados similares con ambos tipos de tratamiento. En algunos trabajos respecto a la personalidad de las pacientes con TDPM, se han observado puntuaciones elevadas de neuroticismo e incluso se ha sugerido que estos rasgos podrian llevar a la paciente a magnificar los sintomas normales. Sin embargo, la aplicacion de los cuestionarios de personalidad con frecuencia se realiza en la fase premenstrual cuando los sintomas son mas evidentes, lo que puede ser un factor que sesgue los resultados. En otros estudios no se indica en que fase se aplicaron los cuestionarios de personalidad. Mas aun, no se ha documentado en los inventarios de personalidad los cambios que pueden ocurrir despues del tratamiento. Objetivo En este estudio evaluamos la respuesta al tratamiento continuo y al tratamiento intermitente en pacientes con TDPM y los rasgos de personalidad de las pacientes que lo presentan. Metodo Se recluto a las pacientes en el area de consulta externa del Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria. Todas ellas aceptaron participar en el estudio y firmaron una hoja de consentimiento informado. El medico de primer contacto realizo una entrevista individual e hizo el diagnostico presuntivo de TDPM; posteriormente refirio a la paciente entrevistada con el medico responsable de este estudio, para una segunda entrevista que confirmara el diagnostico presuntivo y permitiera realizar una Historia Clinica completa, con enfasis en los antecedentes psiquiatricos y ginecobstetricos. El diagnostico de certeza se realizo de acuerdo con los criterios del DSM-IV con la aplicacion del diario de sintomas durante dos ciclos consecutivos, durante los cuales se debia confirmar la ausencia de sintomas en la fase folicular y el incremento de la puntuacion en la fase lutea. Todas las pacientes debian tener ciclos menstruales regulares. Los criterios de exclusion fueron: cualquier tipo de tratamiento hormonal que incluyera anticonceptivos hormonales, presencia de enfermedad ginecologica o endocrina, embarazo o lactancia, otro diagnostico en eje I, que incluyera abuso de sustancias, uso de psicofarmacos durante los seis meses previos al inicio del estudio, o alguna contraindicacion para el uso de citalopram. Se incluyo a un total de 23 pacientes seleccionadas al azar para ubicarlas en uno de los dos grupos: 12 pacientes recibieron 20 mg/dia de citalopram durante la semana previa a la menstruacion y otras 11, 20 mg/dia de citalopram durante todo el ciclo menstrual. Las pacientes del primer grupo recibieron placebo durante las tres semanas restantes del ciclo, en capsulas identicas a las del medicamento. La asignacion al tratamiento fue de doble ciego. Los instrumentos de evaluacion fueron el cuestionario de malestar menstrual de Moos (DMM), el Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck (CPE) y el Listado de Sintomas de Hopkins (SCL-90), que se aplicaron tanto en la fase folicular como en la fase lutea, al inicio y al final del estudio. Se cito a las pacientes a lo largo de dos ciclos menstruales consecutivos, durante la fase folicular y la fase lutea. La mejoria fue evaluada despues de dos ciclos de tratamiento y se definio como la disminucion de al menos diez puntos en el Diario de malestar menstrual de Moos. Analisis estadistico Se aplico el MANOVA para evaluar las puntuaciones del DMM con respecto a tiempo y grupo. Se realizo el analisis multivariado para la evaluacion del grupo (intermitente vs continuo), tiempo (inicial y final), y fase (folicular y lutea). Se realizo una prueba Chi cuadrada para observar la relacion entre la calidad de respondedora y no respondedora con el grupo en tratamiento. La subescala de neuroticismo se analizo con una prueba t para variables independientes, con respecto al grupo de tratamiento y al tiempo. Resultados Diecinueve pacientes completaron el estudio y fueron incluidas en el analisis estadistico: diez en el grupo intermitente y 9 en el grupo continuo. Las caracteristicas clinicas y sociodemograficas no difirieron significativamente entre los dos grupos. En la linea basal las puntuaciones del DMM fueron mayores en el grupo de tratamiento intermitente, sin embargo, esto fue producto del azar. La sintomatologia premenstrual de acuerdo con el DMM, disminuyo en ambos grupos de tratamiento; sin embargo, la respuesta fue mayor en las pacientes que recibian tratamiento continuo. Para clasificar a las pacientes como respondedoras o no respondedoras se uso como criterio la disminucion de 10 puntos o mas en el DMM durante la fase lutea, con respecto a la misma fase en la linea basal. El total de respondedoras fue de 12 pacientes (63.1%). De las pacientes que respondieron, 8 pertenecian al grupo de tratamiento continuo (66.6%) y 4 al grupo de tratamiento intermitente (33.3%). Se encontro una relacion estadisticamente significativa entre la calidad de respondedora y el grupo de tratamiento. Con respecto al SCL-90 se observo una disminucion en las puntuaciones de ansiedad y depresion en las fases luteas. En ambos grupos, las puntuaciones iniciales de neuroticismo fueron elevadas y disminuyeron significativamente al final del tratamiento. En general el citalopram fue bien tolerado por todas las pacientes, los efectos secundarios mas documentados fueron nausea, boca seca y diarrea. Conclusiones Los resultados sugieren que las pacientes con TDPM responden a la administracion de citalopram en forma continua, aunque en estudios previos tambien se apoya la administracion del tratamiento intermitente. En este estudio, encontramos que las puntuaciones de neuroticismo en la linea basal fueron mayores durante la fase lutea que durante la fase folicular y que al concluir el tratamiento estas puntuaciones disminuyeron significativamente, en ambos grupos de pacientes.",

Idiopathic RBD occurs in the absence of any neurological disease or other possible cause, is male-predominant and its clinical course is generally chronic progressive. Secondary RBD may be related to neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Recent long-term prospective studies have shown that 30% to 65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disorder with the rate of emergence depending on the length of the follow-up period. RBD may therefore be one of the earliest signs of and/or a long-term predictor for neurodegenerative disorders. Because RBD antecedes the development of these disorders by several years or decades, its recognition may enable the delay or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders through the early application of neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapies in the future.",

In order to assess the magnitude of this phenomenon, the authors have reviewed 135 cases of posttraumatic unconsciousness lasting more than 2 weeks, from among the entire propulation of patients with severe head injury managed in 10 years in their neurosurgical intensive care unit. The incidence of prolonged coma was 4% of all patients with acute traumatic coma, and 0.6% of all hospitalized patients with head injury. By 1 year after trauma, 30% of the patients had died, 8% survived in a vegetative state, 31% survived with severe disabilities, and 31% had made a satisfactory recovery. The early clinical picture of prolonged unconsciousness has no predictive value as to further evolution. Patients emerge from unconsciousness in consecutive steps representing the restoration of increasingly complex neurological functions; the timing of these steps is very variable and sometimes covers several months. The time distribution of recovery steps in individual cases is of limited predictive value as to outcome. The most frequent state during the recovery process is the condition of wakefulness without awareness, which should not be pronounced “permanent” earlier than 1 year after injury.",

      "abstract": "Organic mental disorders with cognitive impairment constitute an important medical and public health problem in elderly people. The emergence of severe acute psychiatric manifestations of delirium as a consequence of structural brain disease or cerebral dysfunction related to some other physical illness is well known in clinical practice. After a long period of nosological inconsistency, the DSM-111, and now the DSM-111-R, present operational diagnostic criteria for delirium emphasizing the cognitive symptoms of the disorder. At the same time different psychomotor symptoms in, for example, hyperkinetic, mixed, or silent delirium are also being recognized. In addition, many clinical studies have illustrated the wide variation in predisposing, precipitating, and sustaining factors for delirium, thus providing a basis for etiological hypotheses.",

Patient's main complaints are related to difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep (initial or middle insomnia, respectively) and poor quality of sleep. Early awakening or terminal insomnia is most described in the depressive conditions. Hypersomnia may be the main symptom in some depressive disorders, as seasonal depression, depression with atypical features or depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Polysomnographic evaluation shows, in general, a significative reduction in the efficiency and total time of sleep, in detriment to the amount of slow wave sleep. The reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency is mainly described for the depression, but has also been reported in other psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

Induction of mania in our patient is keeping with the literature regarding induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at a lower dose of quetiapine. Hypomanic or manic symptoms at a low dose of quetiapine are brief and seem to reverse the effect by either discontinuing the causing agent or increasing it dose. Quetiapine being an atypical antipsychotic possess antidepressant property at low doses as well as mood stabilizer at higher doses. At lower dose, due to its serotonergic antagonism property, quetiapine appears to induce or worsen hypomanic or manic symptoms. As the dosage increases its dopamine antagonistic activity become more prominent and the medication acts as a mood stabilizer. This is one of the possible explanations of disappearing of manic or hypomanic symptoms at a higher dose.",

The connection between depression and alterations in gonadal function may have further psychophysiological implications.

Future studies using these constructs will be of use in further clarifying psychological and neuroendocrinological relationships.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although diseases similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been recognized for centuries under various rubrics, strict diagnostic criteria for conditions dominated by medically unexplained chronic fatigue were first proposed in 1988. Current diagnostic criteria were originally crafted in 1994 by an International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group as an attempt to standardize patient populations included in research studies. The International CFS Research Case Definition requires chronic fatigue of at least six‐months duration; this fatigue cannot be substantially alleviated by rest, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is associated with substantial reductions in occupational, social, and personal activities. In addition, at least four out of the following eight symptoms must occur with fatigue in a six‐month period: prolonged extraordinary postexertional fatigue, impaired memory or concentration, unrefreshing sleep, aching or stiff muscles, multijoint pain, sore throat, tender glands, and new headaches (Fukuda et al., 1994). Importantly, the research case definition precludes classification as CFS if a patient has an identifiable medical cause of being fatigued. Similarly, individuals with certain psychiatric conditions cannot be classified as CFS in research studies. Exclusionary psychiatric conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and melancholic major depression. Notably, comorbidity with psychiatric disorders is relatively high. Recent data indicate that almost 60% of CFS cases in the population suffer from at least one comorbid psychiatric condition, with affective disorders being the most prevalent ones.",

      "title": "Non‐motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Although still considered a paradigmatic movement disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a broad spectrum of non‐motor symptoms. These include disorders of mood and affect with apathy, anhedonia and depression, cognitive dysfunction and hallucinosis, as well as complex behavioural disorders. Sensory dysfunction with hyposmia or pain is almost universal, as are disturbances of sleep–wake cycle regulation. Autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension, urogenital dysfunction and constipation is also present to some degree in a majority of patients. Whilst overall non‐motor symptoms become increasingly prevalent with advancing disease, many of them can also antedate the first occurrence of motor signs – most notably depression, hyposmia or rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). Although exact clinicopathological correlations for most of these non‐motor features are still poorly understood, the occurrence of constipation, RBD or hyposmia prior to the onset of clinically overt motor dysfunction would appear consistent with the ascending hypothesis of PD pathology proposed by Braak and colleagues. Screening these early non‐motor features might, therefore, be one approach towards early ‘preclinical’ diagnosis of PD. This review article provides an overview of the clinical spectrum of non‐motor symptoms in PD together with a brief review of treatment options.",

      "title": "Kronična migrena kao socioekonomski problem današnjice",
      "abstract": "Chronic migraine (CM) is a disabling primary headache with the prevalence in the world between 0.9 to 5.1%. It is defined by ICHD-3 criteria as headache that lasts 15 or more days per month for at least 3 months while an 8 days headache per month fulfills the criteria for migraine. CM is typically a progressive episodic migraine (EM), ranging 2.5 – 3 % per year, with a slowly increase in headache frequency and migraine associated symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia). There are several risk factors that increase the risk of transformation in CM. One of them is the excessive use of medication, which initiated the discussion regarding the causal or consequential association with CM or with chronic daily headache (CDH). It is believed that CM is, among the four types of CDH, the most debilitating type of long duration CDH (the duration of seizures ≥4 hours), and also a most common form of CDH. Compared with episodic migraine, patients with CM have a significantly lower productivity and more frequent absences from work, school, social activities, and generally reduced quality of life. Also, compared to EM, CM patients visit physicians more often, either due to primary disease, or because of numerous comorbidities. It is estimated that the total cost is four times higher than in patients with EM. Pathophysiologically, frequent headache attacks induce pain modulation system and anatomical damage. As the frequency of headaches rises, the recovery of neurological functions between headache episodes becomes less sufficient. Unfortunately, CM is often an undiagnosed and untreated disorder. In therapy, multidisciplinary approach is essential. In addition to the mandatory prophylactic treatment for reducing migraine attacks, it is necessary to decrease risk factors and comorbidities and also to limit the intake of acute symptomatic drugs. ----- The aim of this paper is to emphasize the importance of socioeconomic aspect of CM through the comparison with EM, underlining the importance of risk factors in transformation into the CM. Also, this paper will present an overview of the changes in classification and nomenclature and give a review of the pathophysiological changes, diagnosis and treatment of CM, based on the most recent evidences.",

The positive and negative symptom dimensions are also associated with distinct cognitive deficits. In general, positive symptoms are related to auditory-processing deficits and negative symptoms to visual/motor dysfunctions. The interaction of frontal and septohippocampal brain systems, and failures of information-processing automaticity and self-monitoring, have been proposed as the bases of positive symptoms. Negative symptoms are thought to arise from abnormalities in the complex interactions of frontal and striatal systems. Recent theoretical analyses have recommended a focus on the cognitive and neuropsychological analysis of specific symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) instead of on the more heterogeneous symptom clusters or dimensions. Studies of specific symptoms indicate that patients with hallucinations have deficits in discriminating the source of information. Delusions have been related to abnormal inference processes as well as abnormal perceptual experiences. Studies should now examine the links between information-processing abnormalities and symptoms over time, as the latter change, within the framework of explicit, disconfirmable theoretical models.",

      "title": "Treatment‐resistant depression invites persistent reflection",
      "abstract": "As admirably detailed by McIntyre et al1, most definitions of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) weight failure to respond to a set of antidepressant medications and other physical treatment options. Is this the optimal paradigm when major depressive episodes may be caused not only by biological factors, but also by social and psychological ones? Wouldn't we expect, for example, that a woman depressed due to abuse by a coercive husband, or a man whose procrastinating perfectionism leads his manager to heap opprobrium and deep depression on him, fails to respond to two or three antidepressants of different classes and at appropriate doses? If the incorrect treatment paradigm is employed in the latter instances (i.e., antidepressant medication rather than respective social and psychological interventions being prioritized) is non-response better viewed as \"treatment failure\" (and accorded TRD status) or more as \"paradigm failure\"? Similarly, delivery of multiple psychotherapy approaches alone to an individual with severe melancholic depression might generate TRD status but more correctly reflect paradigm failure. In concept and operation, most TRD models and definitions constrain the heterogeneity of depressive disorders and then effect a Procrustean management model weighted to physical treatments. McIntyre et al1 consider an alternate \"difficult-to-treat\" framework, which they regard as relying more on a biopsychosocial approach. Such an approach theoretically allows alternative definitional and management strategies. The authors note that psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as first-line strategies for those with mild or moderately severe depressions. This might allow TRD definition to be weighted by baseline depression severity. For example, for those with \"severe\" depression, TRD status would be assigned by failure to respond to a sequential and operationalized set of drug and physical treatment strategies, thus weighting their management to biological treatments, while those with less severe depression would achieve TRD status by failure to respond to cogent psychotherapies. However, immediate concerns about such a model include severity of depression not being linked with depressive subtype, while \"failure to respond\" to a cogent psychotherapy would be limited by judging of \"cogency\". A second option would emphasize a biopsychosocial definition (e.g., failure to respond to a therapeutic intervention salient to cause – including psychological and social determinants and not biological ones alone) and weight a subtyping model as against a severity-based one. Such a model would aim for TRD status to be operationalized in relation to specified biologically-weighted depressive conditions (i.e., melancholia, psychotic depression, bipolar I and II depression, depression caused by medical conditions) and a set of residual non-melancholic depressive conditions with presumed social and/or psychological causes. Differing type-specific criteria for according TRD status, and logical type-specific sequential management strategies, would be developed. Rather than seeking a TRD definition that has universal application, do we not need one that has disorder-specific nuances as is observable in general medicine? Turning to narrower issues, McIntyre et al importantly note that some people meeting TRD status do so as a consequence of being \"rapid metabolizers\". Such a state affects up to 30% of some races, but is a TRD determinant that may be overlooked by practitioners. The clinical clues are that the individual rarely has side effects from any antidepressant medication, is seemingly unaffected by moderate amounts of alcohol, and fails to obtain analgesic benefit from paracetamol. In my pursuit of this possibility, I do not find genomic testing informative but, less anecdotally, note a report by De Leon et al2 quantifying that up to 80% of ultra-metabolizers are missed by genetic testing. I generally initiate a tricyclic (TCA), increase its dose to 150 mg/day and then obtain a \"tricyclic level\", finding serum TCA level results to have high sensitivity and specificity3. The impact on management is that some people whose TRD status is so established then become \"responders\" when taking a higher dose of the TCA (although TCA metabolites may produce serious side effects). Further, some people with rapid metabolizing status can be \"converted\" to normal metabolizing status by adding paroxetine or fluoxetine, with De Leon et al2 noting that such a strategy increases the concentration of the active drug and reduces the concentration of the hydroxylated metabolites. Some TRD criteria include failure to respond to two or more antidepressants of differing classes – a non-specific model which allows random progression from narrow-action to broader-action antidepressant classes, but also allows the converse and other sequences. Unspecified progression might be appropriate if all antidepressant classes have comparable efficacy, which is the general finding in relation to treating \"major depression\". However, broad-action tricyclics have been quantified as superior to narrow-action selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in those with melancholic depression, with differential effectiveness increasing with older age of the patient4, while the dual-action antidepressants appear to have intermediate efficacy. Any such gradient might then logically argue for a TRD management model whereby those with melancholia not responding to an SSRI then receive a broader-action antidepressant – perhaps a dual-action antidepressant, followed by a TCA, and then possibly a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) – with MAOIs long positioned as strong candidates for managing treatment-resistant melancholia5. While I have previously employed MAOIs when narrow- or dual-action antidepressants failed in those with a melancholic depression, I now trial augmentation of a baseline antidepressant drug with a psychostimulant (e.g., methylphenidate or dexamphetamine) prior to any trialling of an MAOI – in light of dietary and other concerns related to the MAOIs. While earlier meta-analyses of psychostimulants failed to indicate distinct efficacy, a more recent meta-analysis by McIntyre et al6 supported their efficacy, but with these authors suggesting that their benefits might operate across \"select domains\". I view melancholia as being one such key domain, finding such psychostimulant augmentation commonly beneficial in those with melancholia who have failed to respond to several antidepressants, and with tolerance rarely emerging. A recent review7 summarized two previous reports of people with unipolar and bipolar melancholic depression meeting common TRD criteria (subjects having received a mean of five previous antidepressants in both samples, and seven and eight psychotropic drugs in total across the two samples). Overall, some 20% reported the psychostimulant augmentation as \"very effective\", while an additional one-half reported the strategy as \"somewhat effective\". Some 45% described the psychostimulant as the best or equal best to previously prescribed antidepressants, and 48% reported a sustained benefit. Such effectiveness rates in those with TRD are impressive, and argue for such a strategy being trialled – in those with melancholia – before more demanding treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy are enlisted. While major depression is a diagnostic entity, it is not a clinical entity8. To the extent that TRD status is defined by failure of people with major depression to respond to multiple antidepressants, then TRD is also not an entity. Then, it must be expected that its specific and fuzzy-set constituent conditions will show differential response gradients to differing interventions. McIntyre et al provide an extraordinarily rich review of current definitions and management options, and thus set up a base camp for future exploratory studies. These will benefit from the recognition that heterogeneity reigns and needs to be constrained.",

They are associated with a decline in overall health status and perception of poor health and can have negative personal and social consequences. The term insomnia is defined in different ways and can describe a symptom and/or a disorder. It involves dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality and is associated with one or more of the following subjective complaints like difficulty with sleep initiation, difficulty maintaining sleep, or early morning waking with inability to return to sleep. In DSM- V ‘Insomnia Disorder’ is described under the heading of ‘Sleep-Wake Disorders’. It classifies insomnia under an umbrella term “insomnia disorders” where both primary and secondary insomnia are combined. In this paper the new and updated diagnostic criteria of Insomnia Disorder along with its etiology, pathophysiology and consequences will be discussed in detail.",

      "abstract": "Of all the forms of chronic insomnia, perhaps the most insidious is Psychophysiologic insomnia, also called Primary Insomnia in the DSM-IV. This sleep disorder is a final common pathway for many people who initially develop sleeplessness in the context of acute stressors (e.g., pain, job loss), but then acquire a form of \"learned\" sleeplessness as they become increasingly overconcerned about their unsatisfying sleep patterns. Patients report reduced total sleep time, with increased sleep latency (greater than 30 min), or increased wakeafter sleep onset time, though these findings are not always corroborated on PSG studies. Patients with this form of chronic insomnia are often vexed by its seemingly unpredictable nature from night to night, but to be diagnosed symptoms must be present on three or more nights per week, for more than 1 month (DSM-IV) or 6 months (ICSD-2). The essential feature of this form of insomnia is a pattern of sleep disturbance that evolves over time as a result of psychological distress that triggers unhelpful behaviors and physiological arousal. This chapter will summarize the current understanding of the development of this disorder, and the clinical approaches that may be useful to resolve it.",

Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

Herein this term is redefined, and an additional term, parahallucinations, is introduced. Hallucinations are defined as sensory perceptions that have the compelling sense of reality of true perceptions but that occur without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ and are experienced as following the sensory path, that is, can be localized in three-dimensional space outside the body. Pseudohallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that do not follow the sensory path and are experienced predominantly by psychiatrically ill subjects. Parahallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that occur due to an injury or abnormality to the peripheral nervous system. Insight into the reality of these experiences-the realization that they are not real-is not felt to be important in their phenomenology.Utilization of this classification system during clinical investigations will yield greater insight into the pathophysiology, course, treatment, and prognosis of psychiatric and neurologic disorders.",

The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is the most common neurological medical emergency and continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Our approach to the epilepsies in childhood has been clarified by the broad separation into benign and malignant syndromes. The factors that suggest a poorer outcome in terms of seizures, cognition, and behaviour include the presence of multiple seizure types, an additional, particularly cognitive disability, the presence of identifiable cerebral pathology, a high rate of seizures, an early age of onset, poor response to antiepileptic drugs, and the occurrence of CSE.1 \n\nConvulsive status epilepticus is not a syndrome in the same sense as febrile convulsions, benign rolandic epilepsy, and infantile polymorphic epilepsy. These latter disorders have a tight age frame, seizure semiology, and a reasonably predictable outcome. Episodes of CSE can occur in each: occasionally in febrile convulsions, rarely in benign rolandic epilepsy, and often in infantile polymorphic epilepsy. The issue of whether episodes of status epilepticus are intrinsically more dangerous in the malignant syndromes needs consideration before we accept global figures for CSE outcome, and we need to separate the immediate outcome of CSE from the eventual outcome, which may be heavily influenced by the context or syndrome in which it occurs.\n\nIn practical management we are likely to want to stop prolonged seizures as soon as possible, but in theoretical terms it may be important to know if some causes of CSE are intrinsically more dangerous. The paediatric dimension to CSE is therefore of many different causes and occurring in a patient who is less likely to have concomitant cardiovascular or respiratory disease. The hazards and outcome might be different. This paper reviews advances in the pathophysiology and consequences of CSE with special reference to age related phenomena.\n\nStatus epilepticus is a disorder in which the …",

      "abstract": "Psychological trauma refers to a sudden intense surge of anxiety secondary to some external event that exceeds the subject’s ability to cope with and to defend against. However, the term “trauma” is actually difficult to define due to its subjective nature. The American Psychiatric Association defines it as an event or events that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others. Examples of such events include military combat, violent personal attack, natural or humanmade disasters, and torture. For children, sexually traumatic events may include ageinappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury (American Psychiatric Association. and American Psychiatric Association. Task Force on DSM-IV, 1994).",

It examines the general characteristics and treatment recommendations regarding: neurodevelopmental disorders; schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; bipolar and related disorders; obsessive–compulsive and related disorders; substance-related and addictive disorders; feeding and eating disorders; elimination disorders; sleep–wake disorders; and gender dysphoria. The chapter also provides an overview of intellectual disabilities, communication disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, specific learning disorder, and motor disorders. The DSM-5 includes a number of disorders on the schizophrenia spectrum. Bipolar disorders are considered serious mental illness, have genetic and physiological basis, and may require lifelong management. Body dysmorphic disorder includes obsession, or preoccupation, with \"one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others\".",

      "title": "Liječenje seksualne disfunkcije",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

The results of the nursing diagnosis on Mr. Z found that Mr. Z experienced: Sensory Perception Disturbance: Auditory Hallucinations, low self-esteem and self-care deficit. The nursing care provided is by continuing to establish therapeutic communication with a 1-2 meeting strategy for patients with hallucinations to speed up the patient's recovery process and success in the nursing process. Hallucinations are states in which a person experiences changes in the pattern and amount of stimulation initiated internally or externally around them with excessive reduction in distortion, or abnormal response to each stimulation. Hallucinations are also wrong or false perceptions but they are also false or false perceptions but there is no stimulus that causes them. Auditory hallucinations are hearing human voices, or sounds that range from simple voices to voices that talk about the client so that the client responds to that voice or sound. Auditory hallucinations are hearing human voices, animals or machines, objects, natural events and music in a conscious state without any stimulation",

These disorders should be considered early in the evaluation of patients with unexplained symptoms to prevent unnecessary interventions and testing. Treatment success can be enhanced by discussing the possibility of a somatoform disorder with the patient early in the evaluation process, limiting unnecessary diagnostic and medical treatments, focusing on the management of the disorder rather than its cure, using appropriate medications and psychotherapy for comorbidities, maintaining a psychoeducational and collaborative relationship with patients, and referring patients to mental health professionals when appropriate.",

Olfactory hallucinations/auras are rare in patients with epilepsy but may be more common when the epilepsy type is restricted to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The prevalence of olfactory hallucinations in psychiatric populations has varied widely. Olfactory hallucinations have been described in patients with differing diagnoses including schizophrenia, affective disorders, eating disorders and hysteria. Olfactory hallucinations are observed in patients with schizophrenia but usually in combination with the other symptoms of schizophrenia and with hallucinations in other modalities. There are no clear-cut qualitative differences between the olfactory hallucinations described by patients with schizophrenia compared to patients with 'organic states', though the presence of continuous olfactory hallucinations is more suggestive of a psychiatric diagnosis.",

Schizophrenia-likepsychotic experiences and behavior, however, are present in avariety of other psychiatric illnesses that are not classified asprimary psychotic disorders and in general medication conditionsthat adversely affect the central nervous system.In this volume, Drs.

Since no specific laboratory tests are available, clinical diagnosis demands that known causes of chronic fatigue should be excluded.

A condition with identical symptoms, known as secondary mania, generally occurs in isolation in older adults and has an identifiable organic etiology. Here, we report a 57-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a 3 weeks history of sudden onset mania with psychotic symptoms. He had no previous psychiatric history, and his presentation coincided with the initiation of a course of steroids. Despite the absence of physical symptoms, investigations revealed a previously undetected adrenocorticotropic hormone-releasing small cell lung carcinoma that led to his death within months. This case highlights the complexity of distinguishing primary from secondary mania when it occurs after the peak incidence period of early adulthood.

      "abstract": "Baclofen withdrawal syndrome represents a clinical emergency that can lead to life-threatening complications. It is often a diagnostic challenge because of its nonspecific nature of presentation and degree of symptom overlap with other clinical diseases. Electroencephalography (EEG) might provide important supporting evidence when neurological complications are involved. We present the case of a 55-year-old woman with sudden onset of motor manifestations at the limbs and an altered mental status 24 hours after cessation of intrathecal baclofen administration, following the removal of the pump due to infection, in whom a computed tomography did not show any acute-onset brain injuries, and multiple EEG recordings were performed. The first EEG showed the presence of bilateral sharply contoured waves, in the absence of epileptic discharges and seizures. No correlation between motor manifestations and EEG changes were detected. This EEG pattern was considered to be the expression of an overexcitation of the central nervous system (CNS) due to the loss of baclofen inhibitory effects, excluding an epileptic origin of motor manifestations. Another EEG, performed 24 hours later, showed the presence of triphasic waves with severe generalised slowing, suggesting the presence of encephalopathy. The last EEG, performed 48 hours after the previous recording, when a recovered state of consciousness was already present, showed regression of the triphasic waves and a reorganisation of the background activity. In our case, repeated EEG evaluation allowed monitoring the evolution of acute encephalopathy developed during baclofen withdrawal syndrome, from the initial phase of CNS hyperexcitability, through the phase of metabolic encephalopathy, and to its resolution. This modality allowed for optimising the diagnostic-therapeutic management of the patient during her stay in the intensive care unit.",

Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.",

It is present already in the early phases of the disease and remains essentially unchanged as the muscular condition progresses.

Although not being recognised as an independent disorder in the DSM-5, the disorder is manifested in different areas of the individual’s personality and subsequently became subject of consideration as syndromal, not a simple disorder. This condition is usually stable and long-lasting, its onset usually traced back to childhood or adolescence, often being undiagnosed and/or successfully masked by the psychopath. Some psychopaths are quite successful in their profession, others are commonly related to the violence or crime.",

      "abstract": "The notion that subtle cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and functional deviations from norms are present in many individuals several years before a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia has been around for almost a century. This notion has been at the base of the developmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and has been the impetus for the use of cognition as an endophenotype for studying the illness. The recent enthusiasm for prodromal research derives from two unrelated and controversial claims: that short duration of untreated psychosis is associated with better prognosis and that novel antipsychotic drugs have a better safety profile, supposedly enabling early intervention at a relatively lower risk of side effects to the patient. At the current level of knowledge, the risk-benefit assessment of prodromal interventions turns out to be an almost unsolvable conundrum. On one hand, the age of onset of psychosis and schizophrenia, early and mid-ado-lescence, coincides with the age at which life-long social and vocational characteristics are shaped. Any intervention that could produce even minimal delay in onset of active psychosis or ameliorate its early course might have a life-long impact. Therefore, the idea of prodromal intervention cannot be easily dismissed. On the other hand, in absence of accurate markers for imminent psychosis and strong data indicating that treatment during the prodromal phase is effective, exposing adolescents to the stigma associated with the illness and the adverse effects of antipsychotics has raised serious hesitations among many researchers and clinicians.",

So far, there has been no study specifically investigating the influence of diurnal dopaminergic medication (DM) on nocturnal slow wave sleep (SWS).Polysomnographic analysis in 62 PD patients.PD patients had a sleep efficiency of 70 +/- 17% and an SWS amount of 16 +/- 11%. Linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between the amounts of SWS and DM. However, patients with a medium DM dosage (300-600 mg of levodopa equivalents) preserved a SWS percentage >25% (p = 0.035, chi(2) test) more frequently than patients with higher or smaller DM. The DM dosage had no effect on other main sleep parameters. Psychotropic comedication had no effect on SWS percentage. In contrast, SWS amount was inversely correlated with both disease duration and age. It was independent of rapid eye movement sleep amount. The natural female bonus effect on SWS amount was absent in women with PD.Diurnal dopaminergic treatment has no major impact on SWS in PD, which, however, decreases with disease duration. Disease-dependent, but treatment-independent decrease in SWS suggests primary degeneration of sleep-regulating systems in PD.",

We assumed that, in this patient, the temporal coincidence of neurological and manic manifestations was not accidental, but that the manic state was caused by the demyelinating process.

Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not.

This chapter focuses mostly on symptoms that cannot be easily understood from a solely biomedical perspective, the so-called functional somatic symptoms (FSS). The symptoms referred to as FSS are comprised of varying combinations of pain in different parts of the body, functional disturbances attributed to organs like cardiovascular or gastrointestinal dysfunctions or dizziness, and symptoms surrounding fatigue. Their main characteristics, pathophysiology, and etiology are briefly discussed. In addition, the authors discuss the relation between FSS and the current DSM classification of somatic symptom disorder and other related diagnostic categories.",

Three different symptoms can be described from the cases reported in the literature: disorder of voluntary lid closing and/or opening, cortical ptosis, and inability to keep the eyes closed for more than a few seconds (,,motor impersistance\"). This last symptom can be considered as an unspecific sign of brain-damage. For the disturbance of voluntary lid opening/closure, the term ,,cortical palsy\" of lid movements is proposed. Thus this symptom can be differentiated from other supranuclear disorders of lid movements where reflectory and/or spontaneous lid movements are also impaired. As in all cases reported, the elementary motility of the eyelids (opening and closure) is impaired, it is not possible to ascertain whether a lid-apraxia is present.",

Extensive review of the subject in the literature and our clinical and research findings suggest an interplay of psychologic, sociocultural and biologic factors in the production of the syndrome. Depression appears to play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of the sensory-affective experience of chronic pain.",

The first classification, acute pain, is characterized as being temporary and directly linked to tissue damage, existing for the purpose of preventing further injury, and lasting for no longer than 3 months. The second classification, chronic pain, is defined as pain without apparent biological value that has persisted beyond the normal tissue healing time of 3 months. Because chronic pain serves no productive function and does not remit as acute pain does, clients experiencing chronic pain commonly experience extensive medical treatments and procedures.",

      "title": "Recovery in Pathological Gambling: An Imprecise Concept",
      "abstract": "Pathological gambling is classified as a disorder of impulse control, though many of its diagnostic criteria parallel those found in substance use disorders. A number of unitary and complex biopsychosocial conceptual models have been postulated to account for the multifactorial nature of gambling pathology. These models have implications for varied treatment approaches in the management of pathological gambling. Recovery is a diffused concept that has been variously and inconsistently determined by the remission or absence of clinical symptoms, the absence of diagnostic criteria, or the achievement of personal development, independence, and function. The lack of conceptual clarity and definitional precision make it difficult to ascertain the actual efficacy of interventions or their relative effectiveness when compared to similar treatments in different population settings or to different treatment approaches. Future investigations should clearly conceptualize the concept of recovery to evaluate the nature and extent of improvement along a spectrum that includes measurement of (a) decreases in frequency of and the time spent gambling, (b) abstinence or controlled gambling that meets financial obligations, (c) absence of symptoms of impaired control and cross-addicted behaviors, and (d) absence of negative consequences and improved quality of life over time.",

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

Funktionelle gastrointestinale Störungen lassen sich durch eine angemessene organmedizinische Diagnostik und eine ausführliche Anamnese hinreichend verlässlich diagnostizieren. Die Rom-III-Klassifikation liefert eine umfangreiche Beschreibung funktioneller gastrointestinaler Störungen; in der psychosozialen Medizin wird die Diagnose einer somatoformen Störung vergeben. Patienten mit funktionellen gastrointestinalen Beschwerden haben ein erhöhtes Risiko für komorbide psychische Belastungen und Beeinträchtigungen. Patienten im psychosomatischen oder psychiatrischen Versorgungsbereich leiden ebenfalls häufig unter komorbiden funktionellen gastrointestinalen Syndromen. Führen medikamentöse Behandlungsversuche nicht zum Erfolg oder besteht eine psychische Komorbidität, sollte eine psychosomatische oder psychotherapeutische Behandlung initiiert werden. Ebenso kann eine psychopharmakologische Behandlung hilfreich sein. Die therapeutische Interaktion wird oft als anstrengend und frustrierend erlebt. Daher sollte die therapeutische Beziehung aktiv gestaltet werden; eine psychosoziale Perspektive kann schrittweise in die therapeutische Arbeit eingeführt werden.",

      "title": "Care and management of the patient with advanced dementia",
      "abstract": "References 316Many of the distinctions among the illnesses that cause the syndrome of dementia become blurred or disappear in advanced or late stage dementia for several reasons. First, neuropathological abnormalities become so widespread that almost all brain systems that subserve cognition and function become impaired. A second and related issue is that the widespread involvement of subcortical or 'downstream' structures and systems results in widespread and near total dysfunction of 'upstream' cognitive and motor systems that are not directly involved by neuropathology. Thus, this chapter will approach late stage or advanced dementia as a single or common end point of all the dementias even though some distinctions, for example the frequency of myoclonus and seizures, do persist. Thus, while knowledge of the unique aspects of specific diseases plays a prominent role in the care of people with dementia in the earlier stages of the dementia, this is usually not the case in late-stage dementia (Robinson et al., 2006).",

Regular physical activity is associated with increased mental wellbeing and has shown to have preventive effects on depression, anxiety disorders and probably sleep disorders. Additionally, positive effects on comorbid chronic physical diseases have been found. Exercise as treatment for several weeks has shown to have an antidepressant effect. Similar positive effects on symptoms have been found in anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Therefore, assessing and promoting physical activity is advisable in clinical psychiatric practice. Patients should be coached to reach at least a weekly average of 150 minutes of moderate and/or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity. Establishing physical activity and exercise groups is of utmost importance for psychiatric outpatients.",

      "abstract": "Chronic migraine is the most frequent complication of migraine. It is defined by the presence of headache on 15 or more days a month, of which at least eight must meet the criteria of migraine without aura for a minimum of three months. In addition they must not be due to medication abuse or attributable to any other cause.The prevalence of chronic migraine ranges between 1-3% of the population and its incidence has been estimated to be 2.5% per year. It produces from four to six times more disability, decreased productivity and disruption of quality of life than episodic migraine. The development of chronic migraine has been associated with both non-modifiable risk factors (being female, low socio-economic status and level of schooling) and modifiable risk factors (anxiety, depression, sleep apnoea/snoring, obesity, consumption of painkillers and caffeine). Patients with chronic migraine suffer from chronic pain, anxiety or depression two to three times more often than those with episodic migraine. Management requires identification and control of the risk factors that predispose patients to develop the condition, detoxification therapy in the event of abuse of analgesics, specific treatment for migraine attacks and preventive treatment. The effectiveness of the preventive drugs topiramate and Onabotulinumtoxin A in this complication of migraine has been proved in large-scale placebo-controlled clinical trials.Chronic migraine is a common condition that requires global management aimed at reducing the frequency of the attacks, lowering the associated disability and improving the patients' quality of life.",

A risk factor is a variable associated with increased disease risk. MRI is the primary imaging modality for people with epilepsy. Indications for MRI include a focal epilepsy syndrome, a focal neurological deficit, failure to respond to first-line ASMs and changes in seizure pattern or seizure recurrence after a period of seizure freedom.

Esta se relaciona con una pobre respuesta al tratamiento y pero pronostico funcional. Es necesario identificar los mecanismos biologicos y psicologicos que subyacen en el desarrollo y persistencia delos trastornos emocionales tras un ictus; como la historia psiquiatrica previa, la localizacion y tipo de lesion, el tiempo desde el ictus, el grado de incapacidad fisica y cognitiva acompanante. Los estudios cientificos acerca del procesamiento emocional en estos pacientes se encuentran en su primera etapa.\nMETODO\n Estudio longitudinal, observacional. Inclusion: Pacientes (40-90 anos) con IC menor 10 dias de evolucion. Exclusion: AIT o ictus hemorragico; depresion previa; demencia, analfabetismo, deficit sensorial o afasia: GCS menor 14.

      "abstract": "The acute antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation (SD) in patients with depressive disorders has been studied for more than 60 years. However, hypomanic mood swings after partial or total SD have also been described in people without diagnosed mental disorders. Studying this phenomenon in the general population may yield insights about the mechanisms of therapeutic SD, mania and bipolar disorders.",

      "abstract": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is a neurological emergency and defined as a generalized tonic/clonic motor activity (seizure) which continues for more than five minutes or series of seizures which occur without regaining function in between. Common causes for Generalized convulsive status epilepticus are structural brain injury like head injury, stroke, brain tumor, or cerebral anoxia. Noncompliance with antiepileptic medications or rapid withdrawal due to poor absorption from acute illness like diarrhea or vomiting is another common cause, withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines in patients who consume these chemicals daily is a well-known cause for GCSE.",

      "title": "Dysphoric States in the Course of Manic-Depressive Illness",
      "abstract": "The purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationship between dysphoric states (episodes in which irritable mood is prominent and relatively persistent) and manic-depressive illness. A further purpose is to clarify the probable causal influence of chemotherapy and the social consequences concerning dysphoria. The observations carried out on 14 patients are illustrated by 2 case reports. A strong tie seems to exist between dysphoric state and manic-depressive illness, especially with respect to typical biorhythmic disturbances. Although the origin of such states is generally unknown, there are indications that neuroleptics and lithium may play a major role. Social consequences are on the whole minor, if the disturbances in mood and drive occur acutely and markedly. On the other hand, mild to moderate mood changes (especially when unaccompanied by drive changes) may lead to severe social impairment. The reason for this may be that the latter-mentioned states are misinterpreted by the entourage as personality traits rather than as expressions of an illness.",
